            "text": "User growth and the optimisation of Facebook\u2019s paid advertising has reduced the utility of organic posting. So, when there isn\u2019t the option to pay how can work within the algorithm to build successful campaigns?"

            "text": "Unlike Twitter, which is a live-stream of tweets (albeit with some collation features such as moments), the Facebook algorithm works by showcasing your post to a few fans and, if they respond to it, showing it to a larger group and so on until content fatigue sets in."
        },
        {
            "text": "Achieving a good organic reach can be difficult on a campaign. This is because the repeated use of the same URL is treated by the algorithm as \u2018spam activity\u2019."

            "text": "To compete with YouTube the algorithm prioritises natively uploaded video in the news feed. You can include a strong call to action in the video or add in a clickable URL to the microsite at the end. That way the punish effect is partially counteracted by the video priority."

            "text": "If you use a press release on GOV.UK to mark the launch of your campaign then you should include an obvious link to your microsite. You can then link to that to help break up repetitive microsite URL usage."

            "text": "You can also use standard graphics with a clear call to action. For National Living Wage we had the call to action (\"Search: NationalLivingWage\") at the bottom of graphics and you can add this into the post as well. This is best used for awareness raising elements of your campaign."

            "text": "Over 91% of traffic on Facebook is on a mobile device so make sure your content and all web pages are optimised for mobile by testing on the scheduling previewer. You can\u2019t always rehash Twitter graphics and you may need to change font sizes etc. The algorithm only shows the content users actually engage with on news feeds so if your mobile users can\u2019t engage you have a problem!"

            "text": "Facebook\u2019s relatively new organic audience targeting can help you to effectively target different audience segments and more effectively optimise your content to user needs. Using it in a smart way, as you would with paid activity, can enhance the reach potential of a post."

            "text": "These 5 tips can help you get the most out of your organic campaign posts. The main thing to remember is that the algorithm keeps changing so you need to change up your posting approach regularly to succeed."
