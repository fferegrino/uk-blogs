I had written \u2018don\u2019t paraphrase\u2019 several times in the margins of the essay, as I had done every time I had marked an essay written by Kate during the previous eight months. With one simple question Kate exposed the ineffectiveness of my marking: \u2018What does \u201cparaphrase\u201d mean Sir?\u2019"

            "text": "There is no point in marking which does not improve students\u2019 learning, a truism that is so obvious school leaders can forget it. I teach two economics A level classes and one Year 7 English class. My marking load is small. Why should I dictate the school\u2019s marking policy? Instead I trusted our Subject Leaders, led by Alex Quigley, our Director of Research School, to formulate an intelligent marking and feedback policy."

The Subject Leaders decided that a one-size fits all policy is not appropriate. The core of the feedback policy is short, detailing some basic principles. The bulk of the policy explains how each subject gives feedback to students, key stage by key stage."

            "text": "When working with Subject Leaders on developing our feedback policy, Alex introduced them to the Sutton Trust-Education Endowment Foundation Teaching & Learning Toolkit. We root all our practice in what evidence suggests works best. If you can get your feedback policy working effectively, the evidence shows that it can have a huge positive impact on students\u2019 progress."

This is another example of building policy from the bottom up, working with those colleagues who know what it is like to teach a full timetable, teachers who spend most of their time preparing and teaching good lessons."

They know that marking and feedback are essential elements of effective teaching and learning."
