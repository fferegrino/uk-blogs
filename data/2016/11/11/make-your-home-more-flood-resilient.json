I have since supported many people going through the same misery, and everyone has a heart-wrenching story to tell. On top of all the other \u2018stuff\u2019 going on in our lives, being flooded can often break people."

            "text": "Last winter\u2019s floods confirmed something I\u2019ve said many times: a flood alleviation scheme can only reduce the risk and doesn\u2019t take it away completely. Because of that fact, I\u2019ve become a passionate advocate for promoting Flood Resilience \u2013 because being flooded is not the worst part; it is the months of recovery that take their toll. Being aware, having a plan and taking precautions to reduce our own risk is half the battle."

Working together with Carly Rose, the Know Your Flood Risk campaign\u2019s experienced PhD researcher (who has also experienced flooding) we have produced an updated guide for homeowners, which provides practical advice on making a home flood resilient."

One couple I talked to in York told me that after the flood water has gone, they can now be back to normality within only one hour - he hoses the house, she cleans and disinfects, then they get the dehumidifiers out and put everything back in place. Now that\u2019s what I call flood resilient!"
