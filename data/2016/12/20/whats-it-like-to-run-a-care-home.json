The study aims to assess whether the market works well within the current funding and regulatory frameworks.\u00a0 If not, we'll consider how it might be made to work better, and make recommendations to government, local authorities or regulators, as well as the industry, to achieve this. It's possible, if we find potential breaches of competition or consumer law, that we may launch further investigations into these."

For example, do the ways self-funders choose care homes, or local authorities procure services, reward providers for trying to improve their services? \u00a0How well are potential residents able to assess different care homes given they're often making quick decisions under very difficult circumstances?"

We'll look at whether anything makes it difficult for care homes to invest and grow and for a vibrant sector to flourish, and whether local authorities are helping the sector plan and develop. We've already heard from the sector about concerns around increasing costs and recruiting staff."
