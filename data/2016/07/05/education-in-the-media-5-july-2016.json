She said it is disappointing that the union has chosen to take this damaging action instead of continuing with the programme of talks with the Department. As she made clear in her letter, the NUT should share the Department\u2019s focus of giving children the best start in life and spreading educational excellence everywhere, rather than playing politics with children\u2019s futures over the issue of pay and conditions."

Going forward, it has been protected in real terms at a time when other areas of spending are facing reductions. She also highlighted that we have more teachers in our schools than ever before - latest figures show that the number of new teachers entering our classrooms outnumbers those who retire or leave. There are also more teachers returning to the profession, demonstrating how many people relish the prospect of a career where they can transform lives every day."
