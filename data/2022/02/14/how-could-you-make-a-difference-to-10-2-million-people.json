It\u2019s HMRC\u2019s largest annual campaign, bringing in funds for vital public services, including the NHS. This year, 10.2 million customers completed a tax return by 31 January, with 96% submitting their return online."

            "text": "In a variety of ways, whether it\u2019s just a helping hand getting into their account or working out their mileage allowance relief claim \u2013 it all helps them to pay the right tax. Given how much a tax return can cover, they can ask for just about anything. Once someone asked if they could claim for increased working from home expenses as they had used a lot more water than usual, or it can be as simple as checking if what they\u2019ve entered in a particular box is correct. It\u2019s about helping them avoid honest mistakes."

            "text": "The nature of the queries during the Self Assessment peak aren\u2019t necessarily difficult in themselves, but the challenge is simply the volume of calls. More than 12 million taxpayers in the UK complete Self Assessment, so you need to be prepared. Whatever their questions, being able to help customers provides great professional satisfaction. And after the peak comes another reward \u2013 a little bit of peace and quiet! That is until the annual coding run comes around and the PAYE telephone line gets busy."

For every simple call we get, there is a call where not a single soul could answer it straight away \u2013 colleagues and support channels such as Virtual Adviser Support are always on hand to help. However, team spirit is always high, as there\u2019s a strong understanding that as long as everyone puts in the effort required then everyone reaps the benefit, not only in terms of a work performance perspective but also in a personal achievement perspective \u2013 together we make a big difference."
