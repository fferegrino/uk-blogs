Each of the 3 areas being considered (Cardiff, Glasgow and Birmingham) offer an excellent pipeline of digital talent that would be invaluable to the department\u2019s digital transformation agenda. However, after gathering insight, DWP Digital agreed its expansion into Birmingham (3 Arena Central). While it was a difficult choice to pick one location, it was felt that Birmingham, with its central location and surrounding area, was an ideal place to attract the digital professionals required to join us and help us to deliver our goals."

The choice also aligned with DWP\u2019s strategy to modernise our estate and consolidate Birmingham-based colleagues to one, modern, shared government hub in a central city location."

The whole area is well lit with lots of greenery for a calming atmosphere to get the best from the working day. Our plan is to make the office a \u2018second home\u2019 for teams so they can function as a happy, motivated unit, in a perfect blend of comfort, inspiration and energy. The large open plan floor will encourage teams to collaborate, interact and cross function. The idea is to bring us all on to one floor while providing small nooks to share ideas and interact with each other in effective huddles."
