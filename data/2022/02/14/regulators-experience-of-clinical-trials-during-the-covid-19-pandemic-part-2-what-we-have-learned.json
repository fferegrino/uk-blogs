            "text": "Responding to the pandemic was resource intensive. Assessors worked very long hours including weekends which highlighted the importance of teamwork, resilience, and working collaboratively with applicants to ensure safe trials were able to begin as soon as possible. Effective communication could never have been more important and when done well was the best platform to manage expectations internally and externally. Internally, enhanced cross agency working was adopted to ensure harmonised decisions (alignment) were delivered, relationships were developed and built upon. Externally, enhanced communications with academia and industry were supported by different IT platforms which occasionally presented their own technical challenges."

            "text": "Working in a fast-changing scientific environment presented its challenges too when it came to approving clinical trials for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The CTU always wanted to be one step ahead of the pandemic to protect public health and predicting the behaviour of a new virus and how it might affect every member of the public presented many unknowns. Our close interactions with the Commission on Human Medicines expert working groups to obtain independent expert advice was invaluable in keeping abreast of the latest scientific thinking around the virus. Assessors also had to manage emerging safety data with the additional challenges of all vaccines and therapeutics, including the clinical trials, being more widely discussed in the public domain. Media and other external enquiries significantly increased and had to be responded to, balancing commercial sensitivities whilst providing reassurance of acceptable safety profiles. We actively listened to the public and patients and ensured transparency was a top priority."

We aimed to be as pragmatic and proportionate as possible on the need to submit substantial amendments and in the UK, in general if a trial was halted due to the pandemic and there were no associated safety issues then this did not require reporting to us."

Patients couldn\u2019t come in for visits, research staff were deployed to front line activities, so time and resource was really a challenge. To perform remote monitoring and remote source document verification relies on access to source documents.\u00a0 Although in some cases direct remote access to medical records was possible, and source documents could be shared via a screen, this of course raised patient confidentiality questions which we mitigated. Some documents were scanned and uploaded for monitors to view, but this placed an extra burden on already stretched investigator sites."

            "text": "Protocol-required visits could be done via phone or a video call, so participants could be followed, but there were limits on what could be achieved if assessments needed the participant to physically attend for scans or blood draws. Electronic consent was used for some trials; whether that was fully electronic with remote electronic signatures, or a hybrid approach where the information was electronic, but signatures may be captured in wet ink and posted back to the site. Of course, many of the COVID-19 therapeutic trials concerned seriously ill patients, where emergency consent measures were put in place, which was also challenging in relation to use of documentation, signatures and infection control."

            "text": "As patients were not coming in for visits as planned by the protocol, ongoing trials had to use different methods to get IMP to participants so they could continue with treatment. In many cases this meant sending the IMP directly to patients\u2019 homes. Confidentiality had to be considered, as names and addresses needed to be shared with courier companies, checks needed to be put in place to ensure that the IMP reaches the right people, and of course if there were any temperature monitoring requirements."

            "text": "Phase I trials in healthy volunteers also required review for potential risks. Not just volunteers who were required to travel, staff who needed to attend the clinics, but also the type of IMP under investigation. In the UK we required all phase I units to confirm that they had undertaken a risk assessment before proceeding with any trials. Considerations included the capacity of the nearest ICU for higher risk first in human trials, and the nature of the IMP; for example, if it has immuno-suppressant action that could put the volunteers at increased risk of COVID19 infection."

For example, trial-level file notes can be used to document participant visits that were performed remotely, and\u00a0IMP\u00a0that was delivered directly to homes where this was not originally intended."

            "text": "Following questions arising on the quality of the data after carrying out remote monitoring, we have advised sponsors who have suggested to do re-monitoring once it is safe to be back on site that it needs to be done on a risk-based approach. Therefore, if there are concerns about data quality, or there are data that are critical to the reliability of the results of the trial, such that you would only have confidence in the data if on-site monitoring took place, sponsors may want to consider re-monitoring.\u00a0 But we certainly wouldn\u2019t see the need for re-monitoring in most cases."

There is now more widespread support of these approaches which is reflected in OECD guidance, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation and also ICH E6 guidance."
