I\u2019ve always tried to stretch myself, increase my self-awareness, and ensure my blindness doesn\u2019t stop me from my goals. For example, despite only taking up running during the first COVID lockdown in 2020, I set myself a target in 2021 of running 1,000 miles over the course of the year."

As ever, technology is a huge enabler for the disabled, and I was able to use the Nike Run Club app and the iPhone voiceover to track my progress during the year, even if there wasn\u2019t so much as a congratulatory beep when I reached four figures!"

I\u2019m now very much looking forward to my investiture at the Palace, where I will showcase once again that disabilities don\u2019t have to hold us back."

I oversee the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) of circa \u00a3875 million per annum, which enables a cross-government, integrated response to tackle threats to UK interests arising from instability overseas."

It\u2019s another fascinating and very important role which gives me the opportunity to work with great people in the UK and overseas, as well as putting into practice the skills I\u2019ve developed in past roles, such as leadership, strategic thinking and communication, where my disability in fact gives me unexpected advantages."

With my colleagues in the D&I space, the work we have done and continue to do in the Civil Service is crucial. We strive to show others who have a disability that there need not be any barriers in our way, and to be the role models we ourselves needed."

We\u2019re focusing on: improving IT interoperability and embedding accessibility, including how systems are designed, procured and updated; building the capability of leaders at every level; and growing the pipeline of talent. In particular, we\u2019re supporting the delivery of effective and consistent workplace adjustments across the Civil Service. These aren\u2019t quick wins, but I know from personal experience how fundamental they are to enabling disabled people to thrive."

Inevitably, security can sometimes be an issue. To overcome this, we\u2019ve circulated guidance on workplace adjustments in secure areas (and are working on technical solutions to issues such as Bluetooth), as well as ensuring processes such as security vetting are as inclusive as possible."

Since 2011, there has been a year-on-year increase in the percentage of civil servants who declare themselves to be disabled. This figure now stands at 13.6%, up from 12.8% in 2020, and 7.7% in 2011, slightly below the economically active working age population (14.7%). We remain committed to improving representation of disabled colleagues across our workforce and in particular at our most senior grades."
