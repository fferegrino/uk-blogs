Thankfully, in 2022, much has been done to resolve misunderstanding and misrepresentation around LGBT+ issues."

            "text": "In a different time, many would have faced extreme adversity and been wrongly punished, cast out or ignored. It is one of the great joys of living in a country and era which recognises and celebrates diversity and has the legal means to make sure exclusion, discrimination and oppression based on sexual orientation are not tolerated."

Our person-centred approach focuses on the individual, meaning we are responsive, inclusive and accepting of everyone\u2019s needs and wants."

If we want to be true to our social care values, then our own work and life experiences, including all the challenges we have faced along the way, must help us connect and respond to the needs of others."

The struggle is really won in the hearts and minds of the community, where it really counts\u201d. Social care is one of the most diverse communities of all and a place where acceptance really has a home."
