            "text": "I worked as a frontline social worker in the era of section 28 and there were few rights for LGBT+ people. There was a lack of visibility and positive representation. What we needed was an explicitly inclusive culture and society which validated and valued LGBT+ people, enabling and empowering them to live happy, heathy lives and to fully contribute to our communities. This is at the heart of social work practice."

From 2004, I have happy memories of attending many of my friends\u2019 civil partnership ceremonies and since 2014, their marriages. It is hard to believe these rights in law are so recent."
