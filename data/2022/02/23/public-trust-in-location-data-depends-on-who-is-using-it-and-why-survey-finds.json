This dialogue was one of the UK\u2019s first deliberative consultations on location data and engaged 85 members of the public. The nationally representative survey has provided further insights into the public\u2019s perception of location data and created a baseline that will enable us to establish and test trends through future surveys.\u00a0"

Participants viewed location data far more positively when they understood more about it and in general, felt more comfortable with the use of aggregated and anonymous location data. 14% of respondents thought it was acceptable to collect their location data when it identifies them but this rose significantly to 56% when the data is anonymised."

The survey found that 81% said they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the emergency services to use their location data in this way, while there was \u2018minimal trust\u2019 in all other sectors. The least trusted were social media companies (10%), followed by local (24%) and national (25%) companies, local and national government (29%), telecoms companies (34%) and banks (38%)."

This suggests that to retain and grow the public\u2019s trust in location data we need to help the public move from data subjects to data citizens, who understand how their data is being used and can make more informed decisions. What is more, the importance of location data in our everyday lives - its indispensable benefits - should be made clearer.\u00a0"
