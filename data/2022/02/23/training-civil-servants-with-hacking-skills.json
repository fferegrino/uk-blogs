            "text": "It's simple. In order to defend our digital infrastructure and create services which are resistant to attack, we need Civil Servants who understand the tools available to modern hackers.\u00a0 The course I attended was an overview of modern computer vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited."

        {
            "text": "The lab was specially prepared for our learning, so each machine was isolated from the Internet and did not hold any real data. Throughout the week, we learned about potential vulnerabilities like weak passwords and out of date software, and the steps we can take to protect systems, data, and users."

        {
            "text": "We looked for vulnerable plugins on blogging platforms, and open ports on servers. We riffled through exfiltrated logs looking for passwords and API keys. We found weak hashes, unsanitised user content, and privilege escalation bugs. Whether it was Windows or Linux, proprietary or open source, each system was thoroughly dissected and each flaw was carefully examined."

            "text": "If you are responsible for digital services, you are also responsible for the security of those services. And, as I've learned, a practical course in hacking is one of the best ways to learn those skills."
