We specifically mean web APIs, which are web interfaces for software. APIs are a great way to share data as and when it\u2019s needed using agreed open formats, rather than copying and duplicating data in different places.\u00a0"

This is great, but it does have some drawbacks. The Technology Code of Practice recommends coding in the open by default, because it makes collaboration easier and encourages working to a high standard. But not all APIs across government can be made public because of security, commercial or policy concerns."

By federated, we mean that instead of having one big catalogue, the idea is to have a reference implementation that helps departments and agencies to spin up their own API catalogues in a standard and interoperable way. This will let departments see what they already have and what others have. There will still be a central catalogue for cross government APIs, it just won\u2019t try and do everything for everyone.\u00a0"

The required properties will be quite lightweight so that API details can be shared in the open without the need to share things that might cause a security issue.\u00a0"
