So, consideration must be given to where this access takes place, for example will\u00a0CRAs\u00a0(Clinical Research Associates) be accessing records in an open plan office, public space or other location where others who are not authorised could view sensitive information? \u00a0We have now published guidance for access to EHRs remotely following consultation with stakeholders, including patients and vendors who design and build these systems."

In addition, we are also looking to increase diversity and patient involvement, either directly through legislation or supported in guidance. The consultation on the clinical trials legislation will be published soon and we would welcome your input."

We have produced guidance that covers what we mean by a \u2018trial site\u2019 and how activities can be overseen effectively where the investigator is not physically located at a particular site."

These proposals also take steps to support an efficient and effective clinical trials environment, in line with recommendations from the Taskforce for Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform (TIGRR). Examples of new ways of working include integration of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and research ethics committee approvals via combined review of trials of investigational medicinal products and increasing the use of innovative research designs."

Many of the tools available in the ILAP toolkit are based on our learnings from COVID-19, including the Rapid Clinical Trial Dossier Pre-assessment tool and the Novel Methodology and innovative clinical trial design tool, both of which aim to maintain the momentum in use of the flexibilities available for trials whilst maintaining the open dialogue approach that was so critical for COVID-19 trials."

This is an age of change, adopting new technologies, decentralised trials, novel trial designs and encouraging diversity in clinical trial designs.\u00a0 We see ourselves as a collaborative and enabling regulator and look for opportunities to support innovative new products or ways of working."
