It\u2019s not only important to understand the necessity of helping users access information. It\u2019s also about being aware that by not doing anything, not making any changes, we could possibly disenfranchise people."

Examples include our quarterly special features on issues ranging from GAD\u2019s coronavirus response to our climate work and the COP26 summit. We also publish regular Technical Bulletins which provide analysis in various topics relevant to our work and that of our clients. Again, these are published in HTML and recent topics include budgets, pensions and population projections."
