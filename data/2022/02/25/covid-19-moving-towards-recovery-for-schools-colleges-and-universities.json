Testing has been crucial in enabling the education of our children and young people to continue safely and has taken the much-needed support of staff, students, and families."

            "text": "Fortunately, we now have a strong body of evidence to show that the risks of COVID-19 to children and young people are low. This is due to the fantastic response of the public, including our young people, in taking up the offer of vaccination, which provides high levels of protection from infection and illness."

            "text": "Our data has also shown that Omicron is less clinically severe than previous variants of COVID-19. As a result, it is sensible to now focus testing and resources towards people more at risk of becoming seriously unwell and people in high-risk settings such as hospitals and care homes."

Twice-weekly routine testing will continue in certain education settings that may be considered at higher risk, such as special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) schools and in children\u2019s social care."
