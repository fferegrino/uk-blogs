While \u2018integration\u2019 is a technical term, the concept will only be relevant to our residents if it empowers our health and social care staff to work more effectively and efficiently together, and, ultimately, provide people with better care in the right place, at the right time."

When scaled to the estimated total cohort of 4,200 people experiencing multiple disadvantages in Doncaster this totalled almost \u00a350m a year of mostly reactive costs."

While the average cost of installing insulation was \u00a36,000 per property, the project is expected to deliver savings to the NHS of around \u00a3400,000 and wider society of around \u00a37m over the next five years."
