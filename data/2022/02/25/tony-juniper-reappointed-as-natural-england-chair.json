Biodiversity Net Gain will help communities, planners, developers and Local Planning Authorities ensure new developments are \u201cnature positive\u201d and deliver a 10% boost to the area\u2019s biodiversity."

But doing it in the best possible way to get the biggest strategic impact is the key thing. We don\u2019t want little pocket parks scattered all over the place randomly. We\u2019d like to see the coherent construction of a\u00a0nature recovery network\u00a0which is not only taking account of biodiversity net gain but also the existing protected areas and blend that with the new agricultural schemes. It\u2019s a jigsaw to piece together.\u201d"
