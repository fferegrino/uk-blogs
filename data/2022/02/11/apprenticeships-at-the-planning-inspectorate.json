Firstly, the work-life balance is very good with every effort being made to promote employees\u2019 wellbeing. The structure of my apprenticeship has also been well-considered. My line manager has allocated me work gradually to align with my apprenticeship goals. I have not felt overloaded but instead introduced to new tasks in a steady, progressive manner. This has contributed to an overall positive apprenticeship experience."
