Making time in our daily routines for a 20-minute workout at home, a spot of gardening, or a walk outside with some music, a podcast, friends or family can make all the difference. It boosts blood flow to your brain and increases the happy hormones, endorphins, to make us feel good."

Pick up your phone, have a video call. It feels good to open up and share how you\u2019re feeling with your friends. They\u2019re probably feeling the same way. I always make sure I call at least one friend a day. It can really make their week!"
