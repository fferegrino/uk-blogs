This year, we hear from APHA Director or Scientific Services, Dr Kath Webster, as she reflects on her own career and highlights the important work of our female scientists in the current avian influenza (AI) outbreak."

We offer career opportunities in a range of specialisms from front-line field work and veterinary investigation to research roles and scientific project management. Not all scientists wear white coats!"

I grew up on a farm in Yorkshire and was curious to understand how things worked and why some animals (and people) became ill and others did not. I enjoyed science and maths at school, particularly practical experiments and had very encouraging parents and teachers."

I learnt about a broad range of subjects including agriculture, biochemistry, plant science and specialised in microbiology, studying insects (entomology) and parasitology."

I studied for a Ph.D. in Veterinary Parasitology in Scotland, looking at sheep ticks as vectors of disease working both in the lab and on farms, before undertaking postdoctoral research on the causes of type 1 diabetes in people."

This provided opportunities to undertake and publish research with academic colleagues in the UK and international partners."

            "text": "In 1998, I became Head of Specialist Scientific Services, establishing the system for test validation. This meant we had detailed evidence about how tests the agency undertake work in reality and, crucially, what the results mean. We run a portfolio of about 600 different tests that we use to understand disease in animals and add new methods as needed. I also led on the production of specialist reagents (the ingredients we use to do a test) and vaccine production. This also meant that I managed complex facilities such as high containment laboratories and ensured our teams were well trained and supported."

            "text": "During this time bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, grew in numbers of cases both in the UK and internationally and we started to understand links to human disease. Weybridge became the European Reference Laboratory for these diseases and I was the TSE European Reference Laboratory and National Reference Laboratory consultant on rapid tests, which involved overseeing testing in the EU and UK. As a leading consultant, I provided advice to UK and EU governments and National Laboratories and participated in various European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) working groups."

I have also been fortunate to have been able to travel extensively in my different roles which has provided me with many opportunities to continue to learn."

In fact, the current outbreak is almost 300% larger than during the previous winter which was, at the time, the largest we had seen. Staff at APHA have been working tirelessly to contain the spread of the disease in the UK. Our work also extends internationally, working with other governments and research institutes to understand the global spread."

The NEEG is a multi-disciplinary virtual team of APHA specialists that investigate, measure and describe the causes, size and distribution of a disease outbreak.
