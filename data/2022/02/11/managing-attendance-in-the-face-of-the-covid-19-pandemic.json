We regularly look at every pupil\u2019s attendance and identify those who might be at risk of becoming persistently absent. We discuss the attendance of individual students and the reasons for their absence daily. Depending on the circumstances, we will produce a personal plan for each pupil requiring one."

We avoid phrases like \u2018\u2019what you have missed\u2019\u2019, or pupils \u2018\u2019being behind\u2019\u2019. Instead, we say \u2018\u2019let\u2019s build on what we already know\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019master skills\u2019\u2019, and make clear that \u201ceveryone is in a similar position because we\u2019ve all been away\u2019\u2019. Using the right language has been a powerful tool to maintain positivity."

We knew how important it was for our students to have that time to check in, but we also wanted to maintain the momentum we\u2019d achieved on attendance pre-COVID. These calls played a crucial role in ensuring children were keen to return to school as they knew they would be supported."

One-to-one interactions with pupils are regular and teachers take the time to really listen to a student. Staff are adept at noticing when a child is struggling even though they might say they are fine. Staff are astute at knowing what lies behind a child coming in with the wrong bag or being late and will take the time to find out how they really are. It\u2019s these small but significant gestures or actions that make a big difference to the happiness and sense of belonging of our students."
