Even after I made the decision to study ecology at university, I felt pressured to have a simple, definitive answer when asked what I was going to do with my degree, and where exactly I was going to work for the next 40 or 50 years.

If you don\u2019t like the idea of working in a lab wearing a white coat, then THAT IS OK! Not all scientists fit that stereotype - some of us get to work outdoors and wear walking boots with muddy jeans!"
