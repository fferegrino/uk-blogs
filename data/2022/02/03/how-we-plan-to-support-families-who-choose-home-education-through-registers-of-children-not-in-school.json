At that point we will set out the details of what we\u2019re proposing and MPs will be able to vote on it."

Having that will allow local authorities to know where home education is happening and check that families have the support they need."

The legislation will go in front of parliament as soon as we are able to do so and from there it will need to travel through parliament, with MPs and Lords voting on it in the usual fashion. As soon as that is complete and we have approval from Parliament we will set up the registers."
