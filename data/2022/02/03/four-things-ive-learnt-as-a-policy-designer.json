During this time, I\u2019ve worked on a number of knotty policy problems - from how to best utilise EdTech in classrooms, to reducing levels of school absence throughout Covid. \u00a0"

In reality, policymaking has always involved the user; teams engage stakeholder groups, canvas opinion of the sector and look at the data that\u2019s available to make decisions.\u00a0"

            "text": "Of course, UCPD has a lot to offer on top of this. We need to clearly express how this extra value complements existing policymaking. For me, it\u2019s about enabling policy teams to dig deeper into a problem and collaborating with users to reimagine the future.\u00a0\u00a0"

However, colleagues sometimes refer to us as the \u2018user research team\u2019 and approach us to help them figure out what\u2019s happening on the ground, rather than with a well-refined design brief."

In its purest form, our work should move beyond\u00a0Discovery\u00a0research into policy innovation and experimentation - but it can be difficult to do this in policy contexts\u00a0where there\u2019s a strong desire for research and less appetite for design. Investing time to find projects which are a good fit for UCPD is therefore critical.\u00a0\u00a0"
