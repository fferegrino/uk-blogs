During this period, we have tried various ways to support our mental health at work, such as protecting our lunch break with a \u2018Meeting Free Zone\u2019, monthly \u2018Air and Share\u2019 calls, and virtual \u2018Coffee Roulette\u2019 meetings to help colleagues keep in touch and take a break. Colleagues tell us that, individually and collectively, these activities are making a difference and having a positive impact."

            "text": "The phrase \u2018It\u2019s good to talk\u2019 might be a bit cliched, but research shows that conversations about mental health have the power to change lives, and it shows how important open conversations in communities are to supporting everyone\u2019s mental wellbeing. I really like a quote I read which says, \u2018a small conversation about mental health has the power to make a big difference\u2019."

They\u2019re also our eyes and ears on the ground (and even making that work virtually!) highlighting what might be affecting people\u2019s safety, health, and wellbeing in teams. They\u2019re an invaluable source of insight and we often come up with great ideas that can really make a positive impact to our working day."

The feedback we get often helps us start a conversation in teams about something we may not otherwise have uncovered. It\u2019s so valuable for dispersed teams working remotely to find ways to be open and honest when times are tough."

I felt safe at home and in no hurry to return to the office."

I\u2019d become almost afraid to go back, but when I was honest with myself, I knew I needed that physical connection with people I worked with again. I was aware I had felt lonely, but somehow had grown accustomed to it."

So often we say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine\u201d when we know we\u2019re not. In the right moment, you can ask if someone is really ok, and it may mean the world to them that you took the time to listen."

            "text": "A colleague once noticed that I\u2019d been quieter than usual in team meetings and not turning on my video. One day they dropped me a message to ask if I was genuinely ok. I\u2019d been putting on a brave face at work and it helped to have a chat about the problems I was having. Often, you\u2019re not alone and it helps to know others might be feeling the same. Sharing a problem can take a huge weight off your shoulders, and a small act of kindness towards someone else can do wonders for your own mental health."
