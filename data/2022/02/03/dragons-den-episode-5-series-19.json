Enjoying the refreshing flavours, this was clearly a firm favourite among the Dragons initially, yet despite the merriness of the pitch, they weren\u2019t convinced and opted out. In fact, only two of the pitches during tonight\u2019s episode were successful in securing investment from the Dragons."
