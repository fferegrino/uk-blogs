Considering the impact of COVID-19 and the fact that 1 in 5 people have a disability, digital accessibility feels more important than ever."

However, we feel that just complying with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines does not go far enough. To be truly accessible, you need to put user needs at the heart of your approach."

It is about emphasising that it shouldn\u2019t be the responsibility of just one team to make content accessible - it is the responsibility of everyone involved in the production cycle, whether that\u2019s the supplier, content creator, editor or publisher. We have built in processes where myself and other content managers in the communications team are involved in the production cycle from the beginning. This allows us to inform and educate people on accessibility throughout the process. We will continue to do this until we are sure that all those involved have the knowledge and confidence they need to produce accessible content."

We have identified gaps in staff knowledge and we have started to run training sessions to target these areas. An important part of this workstream is building staff advocacy by creating a network of staff champions who run basic accessibility checks and engage with their own teams and the wider organisation. We also have a digital knowledge hub with access to guidance, information, videos, and other material to support and educate staff."

            "text": "The \u2018content\u2019 strand is quite simple. This is about auditing the content we already have published online and updating it and/or converting into HTML. Our focus is on becoming HTML-first and reducing the production of PDFs. This is not an easy task. Publishing PDF documents has been the standard for a long time and it is difficult to tackle in such a large, science-driven organisation. We will also establish standardised accessibility quality checks, so we know that any new published content is good quality and accessible."

We have several subdomains that require support and we have a mentoring relationship with these platform owners. We want to encourage them to carry out regular audits and update their accessibility statements appropriately. This also applies to our social media channels. One of our additional focuses for 2022 is to make sure all of our output across our social platforms is accessible."
