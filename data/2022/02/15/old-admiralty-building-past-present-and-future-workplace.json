Some world-famous people have worked here, such as former Prime Minister Winston Churchill and James Bond creator Ian Fleming. After joining DIT\u2019s Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team, I wanted to explore the story of OAB and how it serves the needs of a government department in the modern world."

            "text": "OAB was originally one of the buildings from which the worldwide affairs of the Royal Navy were run. The building as it is recognised today was completed in 1905, although its construction was not straightforward. The red brick, and the distinctive copper-topped towers which have since turned green, were not typical choices for government buildings, and OAB was criticised for this. However, the building design let in plenty of light, which was essential for staff such as the Naval Constructors who were once based there, and their precise drawings."

            "text": "OAB was bombed during the Second World War and the damage is still visible from the courtyard. That didn\u2019t prevent it from being the place where one of the war\u2019s most decisive operations was planned. \u201cOperation Mincemeat\u201d, the deceptive plan to convince Germany that the Allies were to invade Greece instead of Italy in 1943, was prepared in \u201cRoom 13\u201d of OAB\u2019s basement. There is a film dramatising this event that comes out this year! On the topic of film, it is thought that Ian Fleming\u2019s inspiration for the character \u201cM\u201d in the James Bond films was Naval Intelligence Director, Admiral John Godfrey. Godfrey occupied OAB\u2019s \u201cRoom 39\u201d, and Fleming was his personal assistant."

Smarter Working aims to provide DIT colleagues with greater flexibility around when, where, and how they work, in line with business needs. To support this, we have a mixture of work settings and meeting spaces to complement a wide range of tasks and activities in OAB. There are quiet task areas which discourage talking or phone calls, as well as large, open touchdown areas which are great for checking emails or taking a quick call."

You can find out more how we support hybrid working across DDaT in our blog, \u2018Make hybrid working work for you!\u2019. We also have a sophisticated booking system, and sensors fitted around the desks which provide insights into the quieter days and times in the office, allowing colleagues to plan and book the best times to visit."
