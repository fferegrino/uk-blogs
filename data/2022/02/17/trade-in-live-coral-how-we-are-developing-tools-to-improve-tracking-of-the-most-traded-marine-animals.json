Corals are the building blocks of coral reef ecosystems and provide essential food and shelter to other species such as fish, crustaceans,\u00a0turtles, and people."

A 2021 study by the FAO found that from 1990 to 2016, exporting countries reported to CITES around 1.6 million direct export transactions in marine animals (excluding mammals, birds and reptiles), 97% of which were in corals. Here in the UK, over 60% of direct CITES imports are in live coral, therefore making it our most imported CITES-listed species."

            "text": "From an environmental perspective, collection of live coral is a localised pressure which is highly selective and considered low impact in the long-term relative to other activities such as coral mining and dynamite fishing. While it can incentivise local stewardship of reef ecosystems, there are some concerns that collection for trade is an additional pressure to global scale threats such as climate change and ocean acidification."

            "text": "But why is coral traded at all? Primarily, it supplies the marine aquarium market and will ultimately end up in a hobbyist\u2019s fish tank. Worldwide, over 2 million people own marine aquaria and as technology and expertise have developed, the range of species which can be kept has rapidly expanded. Today\u2019s hobbyists strive to replicate what is found in nature and can establish mini reef ecosystems in their living room."

Farming corals is a primary alternative, and over the past two decades Indonesia have increased the proportion of farmed corals exports significantly. However, it is not always easy to tell the difference between a wild collected and a farmed coral, even for those people tasked with management of trade along the supply chain."

We aim to build a shared understanding of the coral trade between Indonesia and the UK, and to develop a practical identification guide for traded corals which can help regulators quickly identify if a species is what it says it is on the box, and spot mis-declared farmed coral."
