The dynamic project was developed through the collaboration of various ONS teams, including Data Architecture, Data Acquisitions, Operations and Engineering, across government and the NHS. The PHDA links datasets including Census data, the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) data for pandemic planning and research, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) among others, and was recently recognised at the\u202fAnalysis in Government Awards 2021. The PHDA held of stiff competition and was ONS\u2019 sole award winner on the night - taking first place in the Collaboration category. We spoke with some of the project team to help unpack the key elements of this successful collaboration, highlight some of the challenges and find out what\u2019s next for this unique data pipeline.\u00a0"

            "text": "From the outset of the project a key challenge was ensuring that the appropriate legal infrastructure was in place for sharing data. It was vital that data suppliers felt comfortable that the data they were sharing was secure and protected. As Joy Preece the Data Access and Supplier Manager at the time describes: \u2018This was a use of health data in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible if we hadn\u2019t had the building blocks of really clear data and user protection guidelines.' Joy also describes how this formed part of the foundation or \u2018invisible work\u2019 that was in place, and how this enhanced ONS\u2019 reputation/ credibility with external partners, making it easier when negotiating with the NHS and other data providers.\u00a0"

As Michelle Arnold (Project Manager) highlights: \u201cThis is a large and complex project and getting senior level sponsorship, including senior stakeholders, hooked in and engaged from the start really helped get everybody in the room.\u2019 A key challenge that the project presented related to the quality of the data received from suppliers, which in some cases was poor or inconsistent. Therefore, the project team had to ensure that this data was properly interrogated, fit for purpose and that any issues were quickly resolved.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Whilst buy-in from all key stakeholders is an obvious requirement of any successful collaboration, the AIG award is also recognition of how the collaboration worked so effectively in an extremely fast paced environment. More specifically, data sets that would ordinarily take months to process were made available to users in much shorter timescales. This was only possible through the close cross-government collaboration that helped the project team gain a detailed understanding of the datasets, before aligning them with ONS\u2019 coding and linkage methods. As Dean Jathoonia describes: \u2018Having the right coding experience, and clever people working together, has changed what was a labour-intensive and long-winded process into something that can be run routinely, with ease, freeing people's time to delve further into the data\u2019\u00a0"
