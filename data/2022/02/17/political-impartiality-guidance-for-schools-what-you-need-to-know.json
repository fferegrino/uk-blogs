            "text": "Everyone has their own views on particular subjects and issues and teachers are no different, but it is important that teachers explain things to their students in a way that is impartial. Teaching about political issues and the differing views on these is an essential part of the curriculum, helping pupils to form their own opinions and prepare them for later life. The law states that teachers must not promote partisan political views and should offer a balanced overview of opposing views when political issues are taught."

What they shouldn\u2019t do, though, is present their own, or anyone else\u2019s, political views as fact. As a general principle, they should avoid expressing their own personal political views to pupils unless they are confident this will not amount to promoting that view to pupils."

When discussing party politics it\u2019s easy to see the need for balance and that it\u2019s necessary to present the opposing views on a subject in an impartial way. But in some instances an issue may not be political but some of the responses to it may be \u2013 like climate change, for example. Climate change isn't a political issue \u2013 it is scientific fact \u2013 but some views on it, around the causes, solutions and more, are politically influenced. It\u2019s important that pupils are able to draw a clear distinction between facts and opinions and how political views can influence those opinions."

This includes fundamental rights, tolerance and challenging discrimination and prejudice."
