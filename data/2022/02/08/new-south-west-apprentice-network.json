This included events, newsletters and coffee mornings, which were shared between Civil Service departments in the South West. The project reached multiple departments, started conversations, and demonstrated the appetite among apprentices to network, swap hints, and to discover more about different government roles and departments."

A big part of the Head of Place role is to build a collaborative and connected Civil Service community and to improve career and talent development to ensure the Civil Service better reflects the community that it serves. Unsurprisingly I am completely supportive of the South West Apprentice Network and really pleased to see it take off. With your involvement and drive I\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to make a real difference for all apprentices across the region."

I am still in contact with friends I made way back then as I trained to be an engineer. The network of people, advice and support apprenticeship gave me was just a brilliant way to help me choose the career that I wanted and understand what I was good at and enjoyed. As great as that was it was just in one Department so now image the extra breadth, buzz and opportunities that will come to you from being part of the SWAN and the diversity of people, ideas and interests it will help you find. This is one of life\u2019s opportunities. Grab hold with both hands!\""

Read on below about how get involved in the network \u2013 whether you are a current or past apprentice, a manager or coach, or just want to support apprentices in your area. To get involved, the main thing you need is enthusiasm! You should have a desire to collaborate, communicate and build strong relationships, and to see the bigger picture of how the network will fit into wider Civil Service objectives. If you can\u2019t get involved now, there will be information to come about what the network is doing, and about any additional ways to get involved."
