Which is why Ofqual has published some advice\u00a0which I hope you will find helpful. Written by Professor David Putwain, who is a psychologist from Liverpool John Moores University, it contains some tips and techniques on how to cope with exams and assessments and how to plan your revision."

The most important thing to me has been to listen to students \u2013 to hear what you have to say about exams and how you feel about them."
