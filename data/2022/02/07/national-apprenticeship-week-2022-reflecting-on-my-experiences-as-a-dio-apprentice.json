            "text": "The opportunity to gain real experience in the communications profession, through a full-time job in a government department, really stood out to me from the beginning. What was great about the apprenticeship opportunity was that, although I had no previous experience working in public relations or communications, this was no barrier to applying. In fact, through reading about the experiences of previous GCS apprentices, I was reassured that my natural curiosity towards a career in communications, coupled with my interests in politics, media and current affairs, would serve as a perfect springboard."

I\u2019ve worked alongside colleagues in internal communications, external affairs, digital and social media, and have even gained experience in handling press queries and conducting media interviews for radio and television. It\u2019s hard to think of many other courses or development schemes that can afford such a varied learning experience \u2013 all while having a full-time job and earning a salary!"

Last March, I helped to deliver our communications strategy for the MOD-wide Sanctuary Awards, which inspired me to devise my own digital and social media campaign as part of the apprenticeship programme, aimed at raising awareness of DIO\u2019s commitment to sustainability."

However, I\u2019ve been fortunate over the last four or five months to have had some great opportunities to venture well beyond my work-from-home desk and explore the vast and varied Defence estate."

            "text": "In September last year, I travelled to MOD Main Building in London, where I gained a week\u2019s experience in the Insight, Data, Evaluation and Analysis team within the Directorate of Defence Communications. This was closely followed by the opening, in October 2021, of DIO\u2019s new Head Office at DMS Whittington. I was lucky enough to attend the official opening ceremony, which featured a parachute display from the Royal Logistic Corps Silver Stars, as well as a speech from then-Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter."

Having learnt so much from these kinds of experiences, one piece of advice I\u2019d definitely give to all new apprentices is this: never be afraid to \u2018go for it\u2019 if you spot something you\u2019d like to do or get involved in, even if you think it might be beyond your comfort zone!"
