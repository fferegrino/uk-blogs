However, we found that account balances alone were not sufficient to meet user needs. Users regularly wanted to check specific transactions, including their pay for work, and money transfers from friends and family.\u00a0"

Not only was this an insecure way to provide people living in prison with their financial information, but they often had to pay for the paper copy. Given the amount of work already resting on wing officers\u2019 shoulders, it would take time for them to print and deliver a copy, which would mean that the information was often out of date as soon as it was received. So, the Content Hub assembled a mini 'feature development team', and we started working on how we could show users their transaction history."

I\u2019m quite organised and I don\u2019t like things put on me... It makes you feel less like a chess piece being shifted around. I have a lot of trouble with wages, it\u2019s difficult to keep track of what I\u2019m being paid. Last week it was wrong, and the week before that. When I get the canteen sheet I\u2019m expecting more, but a few pounds in here is a lot. I can fill in an app to finance but it takes a few weeks. It\u2019s happening quite often. I ain\u2019t got no private cash or savings.\u201d"

            "text": "On top of the inefficiencies of submitting an app, there\u2019s also the cost. These sums may not seem like much on the outside, but given the relatively low pay rate for some prison jobs (for example, the rate of pay for prisoners on long-term sick or of retirement age is \u00a33.25 per week) this could add up, especially if your pay is consistently wrong. The other problem with printouts is the sensitivity of this information. If you lose the slip of paper with your finances on it, everyone knows how much money you do (or don\u2019t) have, which, in prison, can result in issues such as bullying."
