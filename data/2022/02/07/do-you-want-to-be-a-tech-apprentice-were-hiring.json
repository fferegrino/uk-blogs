In the first few weeks I felt overwhelmed by technological jargon and felt like I wasn\u2019t picking things up fast enough. However, the well-established support network for apprentices helped me get over bouts of imposter syndrome while developing my professional and personal relationships. I was worried that every other apprentice would be fresh out of school and I\u2019d look out of place as someone in their mid-20s but I now know this a misconception - I work with apprentices of all ages and backgrounds."
