            "text": "When I first started working in this area, I was blown away by the sheer breadth of opportunities available via apprenticeships - almost any qualification you can think of can be done via an apprenticeship route, from software developing to business analysis, from project management to HR. And all can be funded by the apprenticeship levy, a pot of money held centrally that can only be used to fund apprenticeships. Each year we get this funding and it\u2019s important we use as much of this as we can. In DDTS we have a number of apprentices, working in a variety of roles."

Our apprentices have brought new thinking and a different outlook to the way we work, and it\u2019s been refreshing to see."

            "text": "The theme this year is 'build the future\u2019 and it reflects on how apprenticeships can help individuals to develop the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career, and how organisations and businesses can develop a talented workforce that is equipped with future-ready skills."

            "text": "For colleagues already in Defra, or elsewhere in the civil service, you don't necessarily need to be a new starter - you just need to be in a role that will last at least two years and will support the learning you'll do while on an apprenticeship. Anyone, at any grade, can do an apprenticeship if the apprenticeship is relevant to their role and will provide substantive new skills and learning."

            "text": "Providing such development opportunities to existing employees is incredibly important for supporting staff retention as it helps us to build our own talent rather than relying solely on \u2018buying in\u2019 external talent. That is vital for us given how competitive the tech jobs market is."

            "text": "The benefits to an organisation like Defra are many. It works both ways though. Apprenticeships provide skills and development training for existing or new employees at no direct cost to the department, and they ensure we don\u2019t miss out on the increasing number of talented individuals who are deliberately choosing not to go to university."
