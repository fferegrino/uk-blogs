This helps ensure that, if site specific proposals for a new nuclear power station do come forward, these should be better developed and meet our regulatory requirements and expectations so as to properly protect people and the environment."

We\u2019re determining the environmental permits to operate Sizewell C now and will be consulting on our proposed decisions this year."

Building new nuclear power stations is part of UK\u2019s response to climate change so as to ensure we have reliable supplies of low carbon electricity. Our role in the Environment Agency is to ensure that any that are built meet our high standards of environment protection and waste management.\u00a0 And on the climate emergency, let\u2019s hope that the international response is right first time, not least because it may be our only opportunity to get it right."
