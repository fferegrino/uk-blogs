Whether that\u2019s isolation and shielding leading to loneliness, delays on treatment waiting times leading to anxiety around increased health risks and issues, or the pain of not being able to hold the hand of family members during invasive hospital treatments, we all appreciate, more than ever in these challenging times, a simple act of kindness.\u00a0"

It\u2019s extraordinary to think almost 1,000 new people have signed up to be blood donors, whilst almost 500 civil servants joined the stem cell register over the summer. Others willingly volunteered to become a buddy to a person who needs to speak to someone who \u201cgets it\u201d (including a WhatsApp shielding buddy group during lockdown). We want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has been part of supporting others through acts of kindness.\u00a0"
