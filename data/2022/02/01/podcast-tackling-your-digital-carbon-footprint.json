We just haven't always called it out in the sense that we want our services that we deliver to our end users who might be citizens or might be organisations, we want them to be efficient and effective. That means we want to use our resources effectively and well. And we want to spend public money in a way that recognises it's a precious commodity. Although we've always focused that, I guess from a financial and resourcing point of view, it's no different to the sustainability angle that we're talking about now and in DWP Digital, that's what we're about.

We've all seen the news in terms of the wildfires, the melting of ice caps and permafrost and the changes in weather that are being experienced by almost every part of the world. So, I think it's incumbent on every individual in every organisation to look at what they can do. And part of that is looking at what you do in your personal life. But an important part is looking at what you do at work. And that's everything from looking at the supply chain, in terms of where you get your energy from, but also the sustainability of the products and resources that you consume as an organisation.\u00a0"

And in terms of the impact again, it's worth putting this in perspective that taken together, ICT and commuting into work are responsible for more than 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So, if you're looking at addressing climate change, you need to be looking at the top 10 to 20 items and ICT and enabling people to work more flexibly absolutely fits within the top 20 of things that need to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0"

We're saying, \u201cWell, what do we do differently and what are the things?\u201d And we've already started that journey, if you think about the transition to cloud services, then that's a really strong step in that journey.

        {
            "text": "But the other part is that, and I think it comes back to what Helen was saying, is that in 2021, the United Nations estimated that 128 million people around the world were affected by climate events. So, it's happening now. And the sort of work we do in IT is us doing our part. I took this from a book that looked at the true carbon footprint. And there's also something called the Carbon Literacy Trust. Well, what they looked at was how much carbon does sending a simple email cost. And they estimated that with the actual creation of the email, the network transmission, and the time taken when somebody actually read it, it was about three grams of carbon dioxide for a basic email. If you wrote an email to 100 people, and only just one of them read it, the calculation came out that it was around 56 grams of carbon dioxide. So, the way we use our technology, actually we do things simpler when you use things like teams, for example, you only post something once, rather than having individual copies. And that's a small change that people could do. But it could make a significant difference in the longer term.\u00a0"

If you picture ICT as a kind of cross cutting enabler, to all the other sustainability stuff that everyone talks about, so you will have heard about climate emergency being declared by the government, you would have heard about net zero by 2050, you would have seen what's going on at COP 26.

How can ICT help us to meet the sustainable development goals and meet those targets? Also, how is ICT going to contribute? There are lots of figures out there, like Ewen just said. It's somewhere between four and 10%, depending on who we believe. And the truth is we haven't got the transparency in the sector to get the information back from suppliers that we need to truly understand the footprint. But it is absolutely massive and at least on par with flying. And that's the context that we need to think about this.\u00a0\u00a0"

And as I mentioned earlier, I won't go through them all again, but ICT and the impact of it is embedded in lots and lots of areas. But we have said some very clear things. Firstly, we shall not be doing business with any digital supplier that does not meet our sustainability commitments, and that's at a departmental level. So, if DWP tomorrow said we want to be net zero by 2030, all your digital suppliers should be exactly the same. If they don't meet that criteria, they don't get the contract.\u00a0"

Because at some point, I don't know whether people get this net zero thing in the long term, is that at some point, we can refine and reduce as much as possible. But at the end of it, there will have to be a calculation around taking carbon out of the atmosphere. So doing things in a different way to reduce it is fine, but at some point, businesses will have to make a choice about carbon removal or sequestration.\u00a0"

And also, it's going to be an objective to look at your supply chain and ensure that they are sustainable as well, that has a huge influence on the marketplace. And that flows through into a lot of the customers that we deal with from the technology vendors to the organisations using technology in the wider commercial ecosystem. Government touches everything. And so having that statement and that direction, that clear policy is really influential in pushing that up the agenda and making sure that it's part of the forward planning and decision-making criteria for technology vendors, for resellers, for suppliers, pretty much for everybody. And it's part of the government policy that's put that there\u00a0"

And so, we need something that's radical in terms of pushing that change through to reverse that growth and start to look at pushing ourselves at least back to a status quo that is sustainable. And that's the big risk for me for the next five years, is are we going to continue growing? Or can we take positive steps driven by the concern that everybody has, in order to achieve a better outcome for the planet?\u00a0\u00a0"

The first one is that there are some pretty big targets that have been published by the UK government around reduction of emissions for the country as a whole.
