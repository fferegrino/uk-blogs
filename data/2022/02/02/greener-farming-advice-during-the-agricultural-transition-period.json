There\u2019s a wide remit under the greener farming umbrella but one area that I want to focus on here is Natural England\u2019s role in delivering advice to farmers and landowners for nature\u2019s recovery."

            "text": "January 2021 saw the start of the seven-year transition away from EU rules and the end of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Government has set out how Basic Payment Scheme direct payments will be phased out over the period to 2027-28 and delinked from the need to farm in 2024. Evidence shows that agricultural businesses rely heavily on these payments to remain profitable. Instead of these direct payments, incentives will be introduced to encourage more environmentally friendly practices based on public money for public goods."

In turn, this directly links to the quality of our landscapes, the health of our ecosystems and the benefits they bring to society."

Over the next two years, we will continue to advise farmers and land managers on their existing Higher Level Stewardship and Higher Tier agreements until they expire. We\u2019ll also be advising new Countryside Stewardship applicants, improving support to existing agreement holders to deliver more for nature recovery, evolving the advice offer to cover new schemes and emerging priorities such as air quality, flood risk mitigation, net zero and wider carbon management, and by expanding Catchment Sensitive Farming."

We will need to work differently, providing a greater focus on landscape scale change and supporting partnership working to deliver and benefit from government reforms. A \u2018mixed economy\u2019 of commercial and agency advisers is likely to deliver advice for LNR and NE welcomes the opportunity to work in partnership with industry."

We aim to establish a local approach to scheme delivery, strongly aligned with our leadership in establishing the Nature Recovery Network. We will use our experience of setting up the successful CS Facilitation Fund agreements to bring people together to share best practice and deliver at scale and will continue to deliver at landscape scale through advice on CSF and agri-environment scheme delivery."

            "text": "The likely scale of demand for advice needed to deliver Government ambitions exceeds that which Natural England can deliver alone. While we will invest further in our capability and capacity, new and existing partnerships will be vital to develop and grow the advisory capacity sufficiently, to ensure that farming and land management businesses receive the best advice to deliver nature recovery. And that, ultimately, achieves thriving nature for people and places."
