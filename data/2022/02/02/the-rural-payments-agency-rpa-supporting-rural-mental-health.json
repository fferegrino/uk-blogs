Here at the RPA we are taking this seriously and looking at what we can do to support farmers. We know stress is a real concern in the industry and that there are many factors which contribute to this, some of which are linked to agricultural transition and uncertainty over the future of farming. Some of this is practical about how we engage, and some is about how we communicate."

            "text": "In practical terms the changes to how we approach inspections for domestic agreements will make our interactions more open. The chance for farmers to respond to findings earlier and getting rid of penalties should reduce some of the anxieties around regulation and compliance. We know the Covid-19 pandemic had a huge impact on farmers and the knock-on effects continue to be a cause of stress. We\u2019re continuing to review our processes ahead of the opening of the BPS application and Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship claim window, to make sure we have support in place so that no one is disadvantaged."

Through the Royal Agricultural Benevolence Institution \u2013 or RABI \u2013 members of farming communities across England and Wales can access a new, completely free counselling service. Accessed by a free 24/7 confidential helpline, they will put you in touch with a counsellor within 24 hours, without the need for a clinical referral. They know that talking to someone who understands the challenges and pressures of farming can really help, and this support is available over the phone, via video or in person."

Again, speaking to someone who understands can make a real difference and we encourage anyone who needs to, to reach out to us or one of these organisations."
