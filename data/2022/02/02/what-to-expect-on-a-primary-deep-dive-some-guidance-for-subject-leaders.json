            "text": "In primary schools, particularly small ones, we know that staff wear lots of hats. In small schools, it may be the headteacher who oversees all subjects. It often isn\u2019t possible or realistic to develop detailed expertise in multiple subject areas \u2013 neither do we expect you to. What is important is that, as a collective, staff give careful thought to the content they want pupils to be taught and to remember."

            "text": "To overcome the challenges of expertise in multiple curriculum areas, lots of schools work with other local schools to design their curriculum. Schools also make use of schemes of work that are developed by subject specialists. Ofsted does not consider it necessary for schools to design their curriculums themselves. Whatever it is you do, it hasn\u2019t got to be all singing and dancing. Your curriculum just needs to be ambitious and coherent."

We\u2019ll understand if the subject isn\u2019t an area of specialism for you. What matters most is what you want pupils to learn and why. We don\u2019t have any expectations about what paperwork schools provide and you can bring any notes you might wish to refer to during the discussion. It is up to you how you record and set out your curriculum expectations. We\u2019ll ask questions and consider things like:"

During the discussion, we\u2019re also likely to ask specifically about any lessons we are able to see as part of the deep dive. This helps us see your intended curriculum in action. We\u2019ll hopefully be able to see the chunks we talked about being taught and practised. We\u2019ll start to understand how well pupils are remembering the content and using it to understand more complex ideas or answer more complex questions. Remember that, if we do visit lessons, it isn\u2019t to judge teaching."

            "text": "We\u2019ve produced a number of videos that are available on our YouTube channel. The videos explain our thinking about curriculum and how this might translate to subjects. If you do take a look at our subject videos, remember that Ofsted doesn\u2019t expect the language or principles that we share to be replicated in schools. Schools have the flexibility to organise their curriculums as they want to \u2013 and to adopt the language as they see fit. We hope that these additional resources prove useful in helping you determine what it is you want pupils to know and remember over time."
