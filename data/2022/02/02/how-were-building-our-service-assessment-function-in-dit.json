Central government departments working on a transactional service are required to get their services assessed against these standards before they can proceed to the next stage of development."

            "text": "As CDDO only assess services likely to handle more than 100,000 transactions or serve staff in more than one organisation, many of the Department for International Trade (DIT)\u2019s services do not fall in scope. So, we recently introduced a service assessment model into our governance process to deliver the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team\u2019s commitment to building great services which meet user needs. It also means we can share best practice with other government departments and learn if problems have already been solved, ensuring we reduce duplication."

        {
            "text": "CDDO has made a lot of guidance and support available to departments and teams. We are also lucky as many government departments already have internal assessment functions that we have been able to learn from. This has made developing our function much easier."

        {
            "text": "Service assessments are peer reviews of products and services by DDaT specialists. As part of this process, we encourage interactive and open discussion. We use service assessments to continue to build and maintain services to a high standard and add value. Assessments are transactional. \u2018Information\u2019 is exchanged to assess if the service is following the standards and the result is a \u2018met,\u2019 \u2018met with conditions\u2019 or \u2018not met\u2019 decision. It seemed appropriate to follow agile methodology to build our own function."

            "text": "Now in private beta, we are testing the approach with some of our services. We are assessing six services from our five DDaT portfolios, all at different phases of the project lifecycle. In total we will assess one service in discovery, two in alpha, one in private beta, and two in public beta. We are already starting to gain valuable insight into what our public beta for service assessment could look like."

            "text": "Introducing service assessment to DIT is a great learning opportunity. Panel members gain insight into the DDaT function of DIT and the services and products it delivers, support other teams to build great services, and learn skills needed across all Government departments. To date, we have trained around 40 new service assessors. Some are already taking part in assessments and others awaiting observation opportunities before they take on roles as panel members."

            "text": "Our first service assessment using this approach was in December 2021. Ensuring we meet user needs is difficult, as assessment adds time and complexity to service development. However, the feedback received so far is generally positive. Service teams want independent peer review, support, and guidance and this process provides that. Assessment panels learn about other DDaT teams and can re-use the ways of working and processes, so it\u2019s a win-win."

We would be interested to hear from others who have completed any assisted digital or accessibility testing on a service assessment process. Most of our assessments are currently \u2018virtual\u2019 and we want to make sure everyone who needs to take part, can. If you are a service assessor in another government department and are keen to help us in an assessment, please get in touch."
