Another benefit is that it allows you to imagine yourself in the role you aspire to achieve, as you are working in the company alongside people doing the role or similar roles. One other benefit would be that you can gain knowledge and experience from other people in the workplace which will help you determine if the career is something that you want to pursue."

Another reason why I enjoy working here is because of the environment. The site is home to protected wildlife which is cared for and considered shown when construction is taking place. This is important because it benefits the environment side of my apprenticeship."
