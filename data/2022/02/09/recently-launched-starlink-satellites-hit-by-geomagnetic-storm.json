This, combined with the solar wind, causes the variation in atmospheric density with respect to altitude to change.\u00a0 This can cause an increase in density and therefore increased drag on satellites in very low orbits. This increase in drag affects their ability to manoeuvre. In extreme cases, it can cause them to lose altitude and re-enter.\u00a0"

MOSWOC frequently predicts periods of unsettled geomagnetic activity, however it is unusual for it to affect satellites to such a degree. \u00a0"
