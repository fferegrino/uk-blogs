However, due to the degree being heavily concentrated on Electrical and Electronic modules I was unable to pursue it further. For that reason, I utilised my free time during the pandemic to transition into tech. I started taking coding courses on Freecodecamp, Udemy, Codecademy, Codewars and YouTube to start off the journey. In addition to this, I enrolled onto Udacity\u2019s fronted-end nanodegree program in an attempt to take my learning a step further."

The application process was unique in the sense that I applied through Coding black females then proceeded to Makers academy. Whilst at Markers, I had to complete a 15-hour ruby exercise, a coding challenge, followed with an interview and a final interview with MoJ (still sweating from the application process!). After successfully completing this I was then offered a position."

Every week I was learning a new concept - something to look forward to each time. No two days were essentially the same and the bootcamp involved a lot of pair programming which was insightful seeing how other people approached a problem as well as their style of working. Moreover, \u2018Friday challenges\u2019 were also a part of the programme which were designed to test your knowledge of the week as well as independently because the week is mostly spent pairing."

Currently back at LAA to do my placement, thus far, it\u2019s been excellent in terms of learning and working alongside senior developers. I am constantly learning new ways of doing things and supported if I run into any issues. Nevertheless, I work with a wonderful team who are extremely supportive and always willing to go out of their way to help me understand things."
