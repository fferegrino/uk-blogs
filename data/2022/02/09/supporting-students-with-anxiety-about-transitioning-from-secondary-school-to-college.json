To reduce the risk of young people becoming \u2018Not in Education, Employment, or Training\u2019 (NEET) across the City of Salford and lessen individuals\u2019 anxieties, it was critical that our college senior leadership team thought innovatively."

We put in place a data sharing agreement with the local council, enabling schools to share information with us about students that had applied to\u00a0our\u00a0college.\u00a0Identifying the young people who may be vulnerable or in need of tailored support was a top priority."

Upon visiting the schools, we conducted a\u00a0questionnaire with prospective students, where they indicated how they were\u00a0feeling about starting\u00a0college.\u00a0This also gave them the opportunity to share anything that they felt we should know before they\u00a0started their time at\u00a0college, including whether they are, or have previously, struggled with their mental health."

Currently, despite having some health issues, the student maintains an 95% attendance level."
