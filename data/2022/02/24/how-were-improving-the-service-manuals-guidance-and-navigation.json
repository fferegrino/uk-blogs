As we described before, every piece of guidance we update or create requires a specific and slightly different approach. For example, the way we work on an annual update to an established piece of guidance in the technology section is unlikely to be identical to creating all-new guidance with a new community of practice for the design section."

They include users and subject matter experts, though, as our team members are neither the users nor have deep subject matter expertise.\u00a0"

Furthermore, we updated guidance on cookies and personal information and on getting your service on GOV.UK. Beyond that, we created pages for the data engineering community and the policy design community."

How do we help people find what they are looking for and make it easy for them to retrieve it later again?\u201d Our goal is to evolve the Service Manual for its core user groups and ensure its information architecture reflects their mental models and supports changing content.\u00a0"

We also invited experts, including our colleagues from the NHS Digital Service Manual and the CDDO\u2019s Technology Code of Practice team. They shared what they have learnt about the mental models of their users, their tasks, and how it is reflected in the information architecture and navigational structure of their offerings."

Among other things, we showed them a new navigation bar, a \u2018what\u2019s new\u2019 section on the landing page, and new categories in which we present guidance by task, by delivery phase, and by topic. Interacting with users on Slack continuously allowed us to find research participants who provided valuable critical feedback in a few hours."

In addition, we are developing various essential improvements in response to the different mental models of our users and to accommodate their primary tasks. To further identify, prioritise, and measure the most common user tasks across the Service Manual and Standard, we are planning work using Gerry McGovern\u2019s Top Tasks methodology. This will also cover the Technology Code of Practice and other CDDO-owned content on GOV.UK. On a strategic level, we are linking our work closely to CDDO\u2019s new services transformation programme.\u00a0"
