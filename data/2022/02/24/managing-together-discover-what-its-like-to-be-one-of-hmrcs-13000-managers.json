Sharing the little successes and talking about these and how they fit into HMRC\u2019s strategic plan has helped in moving forward with change in the team and beyond. For example, effective communication has recently helped the modernisation of the software we are now using to efficiently do our roles. Direct feedback via forums and test/learn phases has helped shape the development of the software with the end users in mind. It\u2019s encouraging to see how my team can positively influence change."
