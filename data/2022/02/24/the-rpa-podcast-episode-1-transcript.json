I\u2019m James Ryan and during 2022 we\u2019ll be bringing you a series of short podcasts to help farmers, landowners and rural communities keep up-to-date on developments at the RPA, offer support and guidance, and navigate agricultural transition. In today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll reflect on 2021 and look forward to what\u2019s coming up in 2022. Later in the programme, we\u2019ll also have a special feature on wellbeing in rural communities, offering advice on where you can access help and support during these challenging times."

        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: I\u2019m really proud of what we achieved across 2021. We as an agency continued to play a really important role in developing and delivering the Government\u2019s objectives set out in the Agricultural Transition Plan. We made a lot of progress across 2020, and what was really great to see across 2021 is how closely we were working with Defra to support the delivery of the environmental land management schemes, which includes the launch of the Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot. What was lovely to see was that we had more than 2,500 expressions of interest and around 900 applicants."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And it\u2019s fair to say the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme was just one example of the RPA\u2019s work?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s a new scheme but we\u2019ve got a whole range of services and schemes we currently operate to the farming community. For example, we opened up the application window for 2022 Countryside Stewardship Agreements to allow farmers to apply for funding to improve their local environment, which is restoring wildlife habitats, creating woodlands and managing flood risk. We\u2019ve been really working closely with farmers and land managers to see how we can improve the scheme since we took it on in 2018 and it\u2019s been really good to see, certainly last year, the increase in the uptake of applications that we received for the scheme."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And can you update our listeners on the progress of the grants schemes delivered by RPA in 2021?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, grants schemes are a really important source of funding for rural businesses across the country and what we saw in 2021 was a really improved interest, certainly for new capital grant schemes that we opened, with over 3,000 applications received focused on improving Air Quality, Water Quality, Boundary Trees and Orchards or a mixture of these options. Another popular scheme we ran was the Countryside Productivity Small Grants Scheme which provides investment towards specific items of equipment focused on improving productivity and efficiency for farmers and horticultural businesses which is a really important element as and when we move across to the agricultural transition period. We released around \u00a316m of payments on around 2,800 eligible claims."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Thanks Sandy. I\u2019d like to talk more about the performance of the schemes a little later, but December was a crucial time for RPA with a number of announcements."
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, December is the culmination of a lot of work for the RPA and is really important for farming communities. We launched the Farming Investment Fund, including the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund and the Water Management theme of the Farming Transformation Fund. I can\u2019t stress the importance of productivity and how we as Government can support farmers to improve their productivity in these challenging times. It was really fantastic to see farmers will benefit from investment to boost that productivity through a whole range of equipment that we\u2019ve made available. We also opened up the sixth round of the popular Countryside Stewardship Facilitation Fund in December. There is nothing more important for us than farmers working together in a collaborative way, sharing their knowledge in their communities to protect and enhance their local environment, and that\u2019s in line with their local Countryside Stewardship priorities. But it\u2019s not all about the land. We recognise, in particular at the end of the year, the challenges that the pig industry were facing. We announced a package of measures to support the pig industry, which focused on reducing the animal welfare implications of pigs backing up on farms. This saw the launch of the Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme which focused on increasing the throughput of pigs by contributing towards the extra costs of operating additional slaughter shifts at abattoirs, but that was just one element of it. We also opened up a Private Storage Aid scheme which provided some funding to cover the costs of cold storage for the products."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: The RPA has a huge remit in terms of delivery but ultimately it will be judged on its performance. Can you give us some headline performance figures?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: When I speak to farmers across the country, and we\u2019ve done a whole series of engagements which we\u2019ll touch on in a moment, what\u2019s always surprising for people that I speak to is the breadth of services that we do. A lot of the focus tends to be on the land schemes that we pay out in December. To give some context on our land schemes, in December we paid just under 101,300 claims, which is essentially investing \u00a31.8bn into the farming community, and that\u2019s within the first month of the payment window which runs between December and June. That investment isn\u2019t just a direct investment, we\u2019ve seen at first hand how that payment then trickles down throughout the supply chain. To set it into context, that represents just over 98% of eligible claims for the Basic Payment Scheme, around 62% of Countryside Stewardship revenue claims and around 64% of Environmental Stewardship claims for 2021."
        },
        {
            "text": "But in addition, one of the key things we also fund is capital works under the Countryside Stewardship Capital Grants scheme and across 2021 we reimbursed \u00a366.75m for the establishment and maintenance of woodland and hedges. That\u2019s around 5,700 projects and since we took on the scheme in 2018 we\u2019ve reduced the amount of time where we\u2019ve paid those particular claims and it was really pleasing to see that most of them were paid within an average of 30 working days."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: That\u2019s a strong top-line performance Sandy. Many farmers, landowners and rural communities rely on these payments but there can be a delay in payment. Why is this?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: We know the importance of cash flow to the rural economy. While the payment window runs between December and June every year, we always aim to pay as promptly as we can. Essentially, if the claim is ready, we pay it."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: But why does it take longer to pay some claims?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: It can take longer to complete our checks for some claims and there are a number of reasons for this additional time. For example, the allocation of common land can be quite a complex process. What we do with common land is we allocate the available area to those claiming on the common. Sometimes the outcome of inspections can take a little time for us to consider and establish the impact on the claim or agreement. In some cases, we can\u2019t progress claims as they are reliant on the completion of legal work, such as probate, and some just take time because of their size."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Thanks Sandy. I\u2019m keen to explore the Countryside Stewardship scheme further. Can you remind us of its purpose and how it\u2019s evolved over the last twelve months?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Of course. Countryside Stewardship, as I said earlier, farmers can apply for funding to improve their local environment \u2013 that\u2019s restoring wildlife habitats, creating woodlands, managing flood risk and really focus on that environmental ambition. We recognise that we as an organisation want to listen, learn and do better, so we\u2019ve been closely working with the industry, and changes have been made to the scheme this year to broaden out the options available and make it easier to apply."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And how did the changes reflect in the numbers?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: It was really great to see that we received a 40% increase in the number of applications in comparison to 2020. There are now 40,000 farmers in England participating in an agri-environment scheme."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Thanks Sandy. So, what are your final reflections on 2021 and what are your hopes for 2022?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: We\u2019ve continued to improve our services focused on helping farmers deliver the best outcomes they can, and we\u2019ve worked hard to get payments made as quickly as possible in recognition of the importance of cash flow for farming businesses \u2013 and we\u2019ll continue to do so. As I mentioned earlier, we are constantly looking to learn, listen and do better and in 2021, a good example of that listening is we attended a record number of shows and events across the country. That two-way engagement with our farmers is incredibly important and I\u2019ll give you a good example. We did an MP roundtable in Cumbria at the beginning of November, and we had a new member of staff that had just joined. It was literally his fourth week within the business and it was really great to hear from him last week and he said, \u201cSandy, I was so pleased to be able to come along to an event like that and hear farmers talk about their experiences, and what that\u2019s meant for me in particular, now that I\u2019m working on something, I realise there is a farmer at the end of the work that I do.\u201d I think that\u2019s incredibly important, so that level of connection that we need to build with farming communities focused on our need to build different relationships with farmers will be incredibly important. 2022 and beyond is going to be a really challenging time for farmers and our role as the RPA is to help farmers through this transition period and provide them with the best information to help them secure their future. We have great people in the RPA who are really, genuinely committed to what they do, most of them live in the areas they serve, many of them have farming in their background \u2013 they\u2019re either married to farmers, their children are farming - and that passion is really great to see across all of the services that we operate. So, we\u2019re all geared up and focused on delivering better outcomes for farmers but working in partnership with farmers across 2022."

In January this year, the Secretary of State unveiled the next stages of the plan to reward farmers and landowners for actions which benefit the environment and support sustainable food production, alongside vital nature recovery and work towards net zero. The Secretary of State unveiled details of two of the environmental land management schemes, Local Nature Recovery and\u00a0 Landscape Recovery following the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme which was announced in December."

            "text": "Katie: Well, the\u202fSustainable Farming Incentive focuses on making agricultural activities more sustainable. It\u202fwill pay for\u202factions that all farmers can choose to take. This scheme will pay for actions that can be taken at scale across the whole farmed landscape to have the most impact. This includes reducing inorganic fertiliser and pesticide use, taking care of our soils and improving farmland biodiversity, water quality, air quality and carbon capture."
        },
        {
            "text": "The Local Nature Recovery\u202fscheme is the more ambitious successor to Countryside Stewardship and is planned to be rolled out by the end of 2024. It will pay for the right things in the right places and supporting local collaboration to make space for nature in the farmed landscape. This scheme will particularly contribute to our targets for trees, peatland restoration, habitat creation and restoration and natural flood management."

            "text": "Finally, Landscape Recovery is a hugely exciting opportunity for farmers and land managers who want to take a more radical and large-scale approach to producing environmental and climate\u202foutcomes through land use change and habitat and ecosystem restoration. The first round of Landscape Recovery pilot projects is now open and it closes on Tuesday, 24th May this year. The first round focuses on two themes: first of all, Recovering and restoring England\u2019s threatened native species and Restoring England\u2019s streams and rivers. And there is more information on the Gov.uk website."
        },

            "text": "Katie: While the new schemes are rolling out, existing schemes will continue to be available for some time, with the last applications for new Countryside Stewardship agreements in 2023, to start in 2024. Then, from 2025, it will only be possible to enter into new agreements through the new environmental land management schemes."

            "text": "Katie: Local Nature Recovery will provide a range of options - much like Countryside Stewardship - so that farmers can choose the right combination for their setting and preferences. Defra will publish more details on the full list of options later this year, alongside more details on scheme rules and proposed payment rates. But Countryside Stewardship is a solid option for now and farmers really should regard the Countryside Stewardship scheme as a bridge to Local Nature Recovery. As Sandy mentioned earlier, last year we saw a 40% increase in demand and applications for Countryside Stewardship which for us is very encouraging."
        },
        {

        },
        {
            "text": "Katie: Your listeners may recall the RPA launched the Farming Investment Fund in December. This is made up of 2 separate funds, the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund and the Farming Transformation Fund. In January, we opened applications for the \u2018improving farm productivity\u2019 theme. The minimum grant a farmer can claim is \u00a335,000. The maximum grant available under the theme is \u00a3500,000 per applicant. So these grants are paid in arrears, and at least 60% of the project costs need to be paid for through private sources like savings or a bank loan."

We know the Covid-19 pandemic had a huge impact on farmers and the knock-on effects continue to be a cause of stress.
