It would mean that people would no longer miss important healthcare appointments or visits with loved ones simply because they missed the paper slip placed under their door telling them that they had one. And, it would mean they wouldn\u2019t have to pay to receive a paper copy of their account balances or receive an out-of-date copy after having to wait for it to be printed and delivered (which may take days)."

If, for example, they were looking for their savings account balance, they could view that alongside information about how to manage their finances, or find support for getting out of debt. This worked well, and meant that people were never left at a \u2018dead end\u2019; there was always a way to find more information or get help.\u00a0"

We then showed Incentive level followed by Money (which showed top-level balances at a glance, with a link to a full transaction history). Giving users access to their transactions was a new feature and one we knew users needed given that it still costs to see your own account transactions in some prisons. You can read more about our work on giving people in prison access to their financial transactions."

Recently, at HMP New Hall, for example, we heard that if you\u2019re already enhanced then it\u2019s probably not as important to see your incentive level or review date. However, people on basic or standard incentive levels may be more interested to see this, as well as any \u201cpositive or negatives\u201d they\u2019ve had. By the same token, if you\u2019re a \u201clifer\u201d on a longer sentence and have cut ties with friends and family (which unfortunately can happen) visits may not be a priority for you when viewing your profile.\u00a0"

This was a concern. However, most users recognised that they could access their transactions (which was a task we set for them in testing) from their profile too.

This seems to be an age-old debate. I knew I wanted a possessive in there because I wanted users to know this was theirs, it was about them and for them. We also needed the pronoun in our navigation menu, to demarcate it from all our other general content pages that can be read by anyone and have no personal data in them.\u00a0"
