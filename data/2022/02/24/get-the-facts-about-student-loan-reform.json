Under our proposed new measures, our world-leading higher education sector will aim to deliver the highest quality education for all students while providing even better employment prospects. At the same time, our reforms will lessen the burden of student loans on the taxpayer, and we will reduce interest rates for new students starting from 2023, so that under these terms future graduates do not pay back any more than they originally borrowed in real terms."

It is important to be clear that these figures do not take inflation into account. When inflation is taken into account \u2013 so in real terms \u2013 under these terms no graduate will pay back more than they borrowed. It is also important to be clear that student loans are not like commercial loans \u2013 repayments will be paused if you find yourself unemployed or if you salary drops below the threshold."

            "text": "For those starting university in September 2023 and onwards, we will be reducing their student loan interest rates in line with inflation as measured by the retail price index (RPI). What this means in practice is that, under these terms, graduates will not have to repay more than they borrow, adjusted for inflation. In combination with an extended tuition fee freeze to 2025, this will reduce the loan debt for a typical student starting a 3-year degree in September 2023 by up to \u00a36,500 at the point they start repaying. When the total seven-year fee freeze from 2018 is taken into account, this totals up to \u00a311,500 less debt at the same point."

Graduates will not need to make repayments if they earn below this amount. Under these terms future graduates do not pay back any more than they originally borrowed in real terms."

Under our proposals we forecast that the average borrower will repay \u00a325,300 in 2021-22 prices over the course of their loan. This compares to \u00a319,500 under the current system, without any intervention."

Someone earning \u00a326k will only repay \u00a32 per month more in the same year."

For example, at 25 universities and other education providers, less than half of students who begin a degree can expect to finish that degree and find professional employment or further study within 15 months of graduation."
