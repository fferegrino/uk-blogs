One of my main responsibilities is the production of the Emerging Technology Radar and the Top 10 Emerging Technologies for Defra report. These reports highlight what I, the team, and the wider virtual innovation community, which includes colleagues across the Defra group, across government, and external suppliers, believe are the most important emerging technologies which could support and enhance Defra group objectives."

One of the key technologies is the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 (IoT) which describes the sensing, processing, and exchanging of data between groups of physical objects. IoT is important to Defra because it could revolutionise how we remotely monitor the environment, enabling us to create UK-wide real-time monitoring networks combing data from rivers, land, and air - creating an accurate digital overview of our whole environment."
