Other jurisdictions, including the UK, the EU, Brazil, Canada, and New Zealand conduct comprehensive economic or public interest tests. This blog post explains each of the 5 considerations in the UK\u2019s approach and compares them with the practices of some other selected countries that conduct similar tests.\u00a0"

As importers pass on more of the duty, consumers and downstream industries become more likely to substitute away from imported goods towards domestic goods, so the domestic industry can sell at a higher price. In this scenario, the authority found that the benefit for the domestic galvanised steel industry was 3 times larger than the cost to downstream industries and consumers.\u00a0\u00a0"
