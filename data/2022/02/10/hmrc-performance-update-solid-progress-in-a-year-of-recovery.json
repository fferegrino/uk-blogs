In December, average waiting times dropped to 9 minutes \u2013 and within this, customers on many of our helplines were experiencing shorter wait times. For example, average wait times on our personal tax and debt management lines were between 7 and 8 minutes in December \u2013 and in the same month we took around 6 minutes and 5 minutes respectively to answer National Insurance and PAYE customers."
