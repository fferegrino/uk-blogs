UK requirements will remain unchanged pending completion of the consultation on new proposals for the future of UK clinical trial legislation. The changes in GMP guidance will however still impact manufacturers and importers of investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in the UK. We will remain aligned with the internationally harmonised standards of PIC/S and the EU, including requirements for the Qualified Person."

They have been removed from the new document because they are not unique to manufacturers of IMPs. Instead, a separate guideline on responsibilities of the sponsor with regard to handling and shipping of investigational medicinal products is likely to be published in future as a standalone document in Eudralex volume 10."
