            "text": "The modules are interspersed with trainer- led virtual sessions where participants can ask questions to confirm understanding. In addition, 2 interactive workshops are offered; in the first, attendees take part in a \u2018Dragons Den\u2019 session to gain experience in weighing up important investment decisions, whereas the second involves developing a draft national residues surveillance plan with a panel of experts."

These include videos on how to take and process samples for testing.\u00a0 We are also in the process of developing our second course, which will focus on assessment and authorisation of generic veterinary medicinal products."
