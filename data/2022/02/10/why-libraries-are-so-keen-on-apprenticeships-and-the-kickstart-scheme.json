In December 2018 the choices for libraries expanded with the approval of a new Level 3 apprenticeship for Library, Information and Archives Services. The standard had been developed by a trailblazer group, convened by CILIP, and supports people to develop on a professional pathway. CILIP is now working on development of a Level 7 apprenticeship."

They recognise that to do their job effectively, the libraries workforce must also be diverse \u2013 both in terms of personal characteristics and in their skills and attributes. They need people passionate about books and reading, who love interacting with people, running marketing campaigns, organising events, keen to exploit all the opportunities digital presents and focusing on the needs of the more vulnerable and excluded"

Apprenticeships can reach out deeper into communities \u2013 attracting people keen to develop skills and advance their careers, including those who would never have imagined working in a library. Many apprentices find once they start work in the library, they get the bug and want to build a library career. Lucy Neill, apprentice in Suffolk Libraries explained;\u00a0"

Without the apprenticeship pathway, we may never have benefitted from the drive and talent of so many like Laura."
