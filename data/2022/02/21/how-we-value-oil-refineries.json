Our second choice would be the receipts and expenditure method. But historically refineries were owned by oil companies who also operated everything both \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d \u2013 from the oil well to the petrol pump \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t possible to separate the figures for the refinery from those of the rest of the business."

            "text": "In these circumstances the valuer falls back on \u201cthe method of last resort\u201d. This is a valuation based on what a hypothetical tenant would have to spend if, instead of renting the refinery, they had to build one themselves."

        {
            "text": "Arguably CB offers another advantage. It makes it easier to correctly reflect what to include in the valuation and what to leave out. This is important because we don\u2019t value the whole refinery. Of course, the land and buildings are included, but when it comes to plant and machinery, we only include parts which in law have to be treated as part of the property for rating purposes."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s a very long list, but the idea is to exclude what\u2019s called \u201cprocess plant\u201d. In crude terms, this is the kit that\u2019s used to refine the oil, unless it\u2019s in the nature of a structure (like a big storage tank) or building. It\u2019s generally agreed that most of the value of a refinery in the real world is tied up in this. A CB valuation forces the valuer to specifically identify line by line each item that\u2019s rateable."

            "text": "The petrochemical industry has changed a lot over the years. Production facilities, including refineries, are now often sold to other operators. This means both the buyer and the seller must have an idea of the facility\u2019s profitability. Given this, we can bring receipts and expenditure into play where available at the end of a CB valuation. This is the \u201cstand back and look\u201d stage. It\u2019s a way of checking whether the valuation properly reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the refinery and making any necessary adjustments to it."
