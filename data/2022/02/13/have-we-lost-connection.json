You need to be able to quickly trust someone you don\u2019t know that well implicitly \u2013 often with your life. But even outside of a life-threatening situation, we need to trust that everyone around us is working in a common interest and that we\u2019re all pulling together."

But they don\u2019t always have to \u2018hack in\u2019 to your systems to obtain details about you. In fact, you might be amazed what you can find out about people from their social media accounts. You might be even more surprised how many people actively share that information with other people, including those that they actually don\u2019t know and have never met."
