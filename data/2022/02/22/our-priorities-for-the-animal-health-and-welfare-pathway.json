The Animal Health and Welfare Pathway offers financial support to farmers who take actions that directly improve the health and welfare of their animals. Beyond financial assistance, the Pathway is designed to stimulate market demand for higher welfare products and continue to raise our already world-leading animal health and welfare standards. The Pathway will also seek to strengthen the regulatory baseline.\u00a0"
