As the popular wartime entertainer George Formby put it, \u2018for a nosey parker, it\u2019s an interesting job\u2019.

Then we need analysis skills to make sense of the evidence we gather; looking at patterns and trends, testing different sources of information against each other to see how it all stacks up. Conclusions rarely fall into our lap fully formed because if things were that simple, our customers wouldn\u2019t need our help."

Those people haven\u2019t got time for trivia, which makes nerves of steel handy too."
