Comments about my weight and height crept into my head and I started to see my body in a different way from reality. My wife Lindsay recognised something wasn\u2019t quite right more than 15 years ago, and persuaded me to see my doctor."

I thought that not eating during the day, then bingeing after work was a character flaw rather than an actual illness. I blamed myself for being unable to control how much I ate, and to a degree, I still do. It makes me feel guilty and ashamed."

I didn\u2019t leave home without a jacket or coat and covered up at every opportunity \u2013 I still do. I kept this a secret for a long time. One of my biggest regrets is not confiding in my dad before he passed away, and I\u2019ve never told my mum."
