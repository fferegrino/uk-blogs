            "text": "Measures have been in place for many years to prevent this, such as the complete ban on feeding animal protein to livestock since 1996. However, cases of classical BSE have continued to occur, most likely due to residual contamination of feed, feed production or feed storage units."

            "text": "Mathematical modelling by APHA scientists suggested an exponential decline in the number of cases born after this ban within Europe, but with Great Britain having comparatively more cases at the time of the feed ban, the decline would take longer, and there was a low probability of having a case as late as 2026."

            "text": "By contrast, atypical BSE, which was discovered much later, is believed to be sporadic in nature and rare (approximately one case per 1,000,000), similar to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, and can unfortunately appear in older cattle but is not linked to ingestion of contaminated feed."

            "text": "Having a case in 2021 is therefore not unexpected but epidemiological investigations were needed to identify the cause of the classical BSE case and the suspected food-borne source. This is generally difficult because of the long time between possible exposure to the pathogen and death from the disease: consumption of contaminated feed most likely occurred when the animal was a calf, but disease is often only detected many years later. In the latest case, the animal was six years of age."
        },
        {
            "text": "For the previous British BSE case detected in Scotland in 2018, the epidemiology report did not identify a plausible source of exposure. In the current case, the investigation concluded that the most likely source was feed from a silo that had been on the farm since the 1980s, never been thoroughly cleaned, and might have still contained traces of old feed that were inadvertently ingested by the affected cow."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is hoped that this case will be the last classical BSE case in this country. Active monitoring for BSE in fallen stock will continue for the foreseeable future but it is still equally important for animal keepers and veterinarians to be aware of the clinical presentation of this notifiable disease and report any disease suspicion to APHA so that it can be investigated. This applies in particular to downer cows that do not respond to treatment, and the clinical history (changed behaviour, abnormal gait) may be indicative of a neurological disease or the animal is old enough to consider atypical BSE (usually 8 years of age or older). An investigation may also produce a differential diagnosis if BSE is not confirmed, which is beneficial to both owner and private veterinary surgeon."
