The vast majority of titles underline that the findings follow \u201csignificant testing and modelling\u201d and that the investigation has found it to be \u201cunlikely that chemical pollution, sewage or infectious aquatic animal diseases were the cause\u201d."

ITV underlines that \u201csome theories linked the issue to dredging in the area, but the review found no evidence of a link between the disposal of dredged sentiment and the deaths\u201d."

The Yorkshire Post carries our lines on there being \u201cno evidence linking any reports of dead seals to the investigation on crab and lobster deaths\u201d \u2013 and further that there was no evidence found of a food safety risk from healthy fish and crustacea, including crabs and lobsters caught off the North East coast."
