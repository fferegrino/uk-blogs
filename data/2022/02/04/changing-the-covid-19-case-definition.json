Additionally, as so many people have now experienced infection since 2020, there is a larger pool of people in which reinfection can occur."

            "text": "In short, positive tests belonging to the same person are grouped together and considered one episode if they are within 90 days. Positive tests results that are 90 days apart (regardless of negative tests in between) will be considered as a separate episode of infection, and therefore the person is counted as a case more than once. These subsequent episodes are called \u2018possible reinfections\u2019."

            "text": "For example, if a person tests positive one day (day zero) and again 100 days later (day 101), they would be deemed as having two case episodes of infection. However, if they tested positive on day zero, day 30, and day 101, all these tests would be grouped into a single case episode of infection."

However, contact tracing has undertaken a very safe practice of following all positive cases, regardless of whether they were possible reinfections or cases of prolonged infection."

From 31 January 2022, the time of this change, the total increase in the number of cases in England is around 4.0%, representing 588,114 cases over the entire period of the pandemic. However, most of the added episodes have been since the emergence of Omicron in the UK; currently around 10% of new episodes each day are reinfection episodes."

However, if that individual has already had a positive Covid-19 test result reported they will already exist in the linelist and so will be deduplicated. This ensures that the individual only exists in the linelist once. This process happens to all new positive test results every day."

This involves 19,833,233 positive test results being deduplicated into 15,177,316 episodes (as of 31st January), all in one day, so we have a seamless transition of data going into surveillance, analysis, and of course the UK Coronavirus Dashboard."
