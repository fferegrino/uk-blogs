ACE has been working with the NHS AI Lab to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to such challenges with the aim of developing operational solutions with the potential to scale up for wider application."

There have already been many clear candidate areas for where AI can be deployed successfully, from improving patient safety to freeing up clinician time and making better use of the NHS\u2019s vast, but disparate, pools of data."

Data is often needed for research or report writing, but finding out if it exists, and if so where, can take days."

This would gather together information from multiple databases and then rank it intelligently."

This work is currently being assessed to determine next steps for bringing the Data Lens tool into live service."

Prolonged bed rest has been shown to lead to negative outcomes, including increased mortality. The commission explored whether this can be avoided by clinicians being able to identify these patients and adjust treatment plans."

        {
            "text": "Here, ACE worked with Polygeist, another Vivace supplier, to develop a tool to identify those at risk of becoming long stayers from initial patient data collection. This tool, which used an AI model trained on 460,000 anonymised records, then produces a score which could be available to all reception and clinical staff to help avoid known risk factors. ACE delivered at pace, producing a PoC in 12 weeks which detected 66% of long stayers within the highest risk categories and is now being developed towards a Beta model, capable of being used in scientific trials."

Automating this process, and improving alignment and overlay of scan images, was designed to increase accuracy, improve patient safety and outcomes by allowing faster diagnoses, and save radiologist time."

The tool calculates potential anomalies in 3 dimensions, allowing volume changes in lesions, or new lesions, to be quickly identified."
