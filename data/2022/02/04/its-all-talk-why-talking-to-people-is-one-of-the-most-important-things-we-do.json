            "text": "In June 2021, the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) became an independent arm\u2019s length body of the Department for International Trade. It\u2019s really important for us to talk to people who need to use our services or understand our work. We want to ensure that the UK\u2019s trade remedies regime is easy to understand and accessible to everyone. After all, trade remedies are new to the UK and our manufacturing industries may not be familiar with how they work and can protect domestic manufacturers against unfair imports. Even for those who have previously used the EU system, the UK\u2019s regime differs in some ways."

If you\u2019re a producer, or your company supports producers who may want to make an application (such as a legal firm, trade adviser or consultancy), we\u2019re here if you need to discuss your concerns and to help you understand trade remedies and the TRA\u2019s processes and procedures."

We also run informative events, open to all interested party groups, to help provide clarity around what we do, how we do it and why we take the approach we do."

            "text": "We\u2019re also talking to trade remedy authorities in other countries to share best practice, what is going well, and lessons learnt. We want to ensure that processes around trade remedies in the UK are efficient, effective, and as accessible as possible for everyone. To help us with this, we have had fascinating conversations with our devolved adminstrations, such as Scotland and Wales and with our counterparts in Canada, New Zealand and Australia and we have more exciting international engagement planned. And of course as COVID restrictions relax, we\u2019re keen to get out and about in person and meet people in the field as much as possible too."
