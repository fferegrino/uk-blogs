            "text": "Technology and data are evolving at an exponential pace, reaching ever further into almost every aspect of our lives. But while progress and innovation bring us new devices, apps, software and services, it can be a challenge to keep up with all the opportunities \u2014 and threats \u2014 they present."

            "text": "The Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE) \u2014 was established to solve that problem for public sector organisations, initially those responsible for public safety and law enforcement. It\u2019s a fact that some of the earliest adopters of new technology are criminals and others wishing to do harm. And traditional mechanisms for developing or procuring systems and tools to meet such threats struggle to move fast enough."

            "text": "At its heart, ACE is a partnership between the public sector and industry, academia and the third sector. We describe ACE and being \u2018powered by Vivace\u2019 which refers to our supplier community which brings the latest thinking, capabilities and expertise to bear on the problems customers bring to us."

ACE is not a shop \u2014 if a customer knows exactly what they want and just needs a means of building or procuring it, we\u2019re not the right vehicle for them. If a piece of work doesn\u2019t meet the right criteria for using ACE, we won\u2019t take it on."
