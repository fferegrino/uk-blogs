Should we revert to a predominantly office-based way of working, or should we find new ways of working, learning from our lockdown experiences? That is the question we posed to our Staff Voice Forum back in June last year, with a request to report back to our senior team in September with a set of proposals for future ways of working."

            "text": "Our Staff Voice Forum did a phenomenal job! They researched externally, looked at what were doing, what other businesses and organisations were doing, and what wider research was saying. They engaged extensively internally too, through team meetings, all-staff caf\u00e9 conversations, a survey and talking with our senior managers\u2019 group. From all that engagement, the Forum created a set of hybrid-working principles. The principles seek to find the perfect balance between delivering impressive results and caring for the individual needs of each and every colleague at the TRA."

To undertake that work in the best possible way, we must be able to attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce, where our people enjoy coming to work, whether that\u2019s in the office, at home, on a site visit or elsewhere. And that\u2019s what our hybrid-working approach is all about \u2013 supporting our great TRA people to deliver great TRA business."
