In this blog she talks about how they have reduced persistent absences by introducing a new way of communicating with parents."

            "text": "The project allowed us to trial different methods of communicating with parents via text to boost pupil attendance. It gave us template text messages that enabled us to communicate with parents in a different but effective way. This was brilliant and immediately reduced the time needed to carefully craft messages regarding absences. It also helped us to be more proactive, identifying and focusing on the families most in need of help."

These open conversations also allowed us to see the difficulties families were facing and meant we could signpost them to avenues of support both inside and outside of school."

By actively listening to them, we can work together to improve their child\u2019s attendance. We also celebrate even the smallest improvements in attendance. Acknowledging these successes is key, and results in their children being more regularly in school, enjoying learning and benefitting from the social interaction that school brings."
