A study by the Office for National Statistics in 2020 found that 2.6 million adults in the UK feel lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d, whilst more than half of those aged over 75 in the UK live alone.\u00a0"

I vividly recall watching the BBC story where Dan Walker gave a gentleman called Terrence a Christmas tree a couple of years ago. The impact of his own story of handling loneliness and his emotional reaction really touched me. (Certainly worth watching if you haven\u2019t seen it, but have a tissue box close to hand!)"

Their services include befriending schemes which help ensure that older people, who may be experiencing loneliness or social isolation, are provided with companionship via home visits, regular phone calls or letters from a penpal. These are national services delivered across the UK to provide friends and support, and can offer a link for those who may have restricted mobility, lack of accessibility to the public or who may not have regular visitors."

We often connect over things we have in common \u2013 such as keeping up with Wimbledon or our favourite TV gameshows. We\u2019ve also helped each other learn about things entirely new to both of us. For example, they educated me about the competitiveness of the local lawn bowls circuit whilst I introduced them to the wonders of Wordle. We try to schedule visits once or twice a month, and they certainly give me something to look forward to on a Sunday morning."

Their favourites are Brighton Rock and Great Expectations, whilst Memento and Inception are among mine. I\u2019d dare anyone to try and explain a Christopher Nolan plot concisely and clearly within a letter! We\u2019re also both big history buffs, and I felt honoured when they shared details about their own family history and in particular their lived experience during the Blitz.\u00a0"

            "text": "In a world of WhatsApps and emails, I find that taking the time to craft a letter to my penpal can be an almost therapeutic experience, whilst reading about their own memories can feel like looking into a unique portal to the past. My partner knows whenever I\u2019ve received a letter from my penpal as I come back from the mailbox with a big smile \u2013 especially given our other mail is typically our council tax bill or the latest pizza delivery menu."

As well as befriending, the CSRF offers local community group networks via 64 local community groups which provide companionship, and trips. They also have a networking relationship with other organisations to provide advice to members on a range of topics, from finance to bereavement."

I recently attended the CSRF\u2019s AGM, and it was brilliant hearing about the real sense of community the CSRF can bring retired civil servants across all corners of the UK. It was actually a conversation over lunch at the AGM with our Chair, the Northern Ireland Office\u2019s Madeleine Alessandri, which prompted me to write this piece."
