            "text": "The proposal \u2013 covered by The Telegraph, Daily Express, Times, Daily Mail, Evening Standard, Daily Mirror, Independent and ITV News - comes as part of the government\u2019s ongoing action to push for water companies to invest more in infrastructure that will minimise pollution incidents and secure our water supply for future generations."

            "text": "Whilst fines handed out by the courts to water companies through criminal prosecutions are unlimited, these can be a lengthy and costly process. Using civil sanctions \u2013 Variable Monetary Penalties (VMPs) \u2013 which can be imposed directly by the EA can offer a quicker method of enforcement."

            "text": "The current limit for VMPs handed out by the EA for individual breaches of the rules is \u00a3250,000. Increasing the cap for fines up to \u00a3250 million will simplify and speed up the process of enforcement by allowing the EA to directly hand out penalties to water companies."

Responses have been received from all water companies and are currently being scrutinised as part of the ongoing work by the government, the Environment Agency and the regulator Ofwat to drive up water companies\u2019 performance and increase accountability."
