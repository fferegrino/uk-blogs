            "text": "As part of this package, the Government has introduced over 1200 new designations under the Russia Sanctions regime since 22nd February 2022. Putting this into context, at the time of OFSI\u2019s last annual review, there were a total of 2213 individuals and entities designated in total across all regimes. Moreover, the new designations were imposed on a major G20 economy with significant economic ties to the UK and global economies. Previous regimes of broadly comparable scope, for example DPRK and Iran, targeted smaller, less globally integrated economies."

This includes funds needed to meet the basic needs of any of these individuals or entities, and the payment of fees for any legal representation they might seek."

            "text": "In acknowledging the importance of a person\u2019s ability to be receive legal advice and representation, OFSI has long had a position of not prohibiting the provision of legal advice to a designated person under an asset freeze. Payment for legal services, including payment for legal services provided on credit, by contrast has required an OFSI licence."

            "text": "However, considering the extraordinary number of new designations under the Russia and Belarus regimes, and the correlating increase in the number of those seeking a licence from OFSI for the payment of legal fees, OFSI has issued a general licence to permit the payment of legal fees owed by individuals and entities designated under either of these regimes."

VAT) cap on the amount that can be claimed over the duration of the licence. This amount reflects the potentially costly nature of legal work and therefore covers legitimate requests, while still maintaining the policy intent of a financial sanctions designation."

            "text": "For all legal work commenced post-designation, users of the licence will need to demonstrate through their reporting obligations that all fees which have been paid are reasonable. This will be done by providing details of hourly fees, workstreams, and evidence that overall fees are at or below a cap of \u00a3500,000 (inc. VAT). It\u2019s important to note that this cap applies to a designated person\u2019s total legal fees per case and the cap can be used separately by multiple legal firms involved in a case."

VAT) could be paid under the General Licence. For any fees above these caps, a specific licence must be sought."
