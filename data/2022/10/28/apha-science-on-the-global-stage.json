This happens through a mixture of oral and poster presentations, question and answer sessions, panel discussions, workshops and social events."

As this was my first ever presentation at a conference (thanks to COVID-19 interrupting my PhD), I was quite nervous, especially as there were so many people. A Monday morning slot would have been preferable to get it out of the way!"

Matthew Coleman spoke about a model to simulate the spread of African Swine Fever in Great Britain, while Colin Birch presented a statistical analysis of the impact of badger control on bovine tuberculosis in England. Antimicrobial resistance, Salmonella in pigs and coronavirus in wildlife were some of the other topics we had to offer."

I particularly enjoyed a talk about a food-safety campaign for chicken consumption at urban food markets that was run in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Also, as my role at APHA is in risk modelling, there were several presentations in this area that I found interesting."

In particular, his epidemiological work concluded that BSE had emerged due to the consumption of meat-and-bone meal that had been fed to cattle."
