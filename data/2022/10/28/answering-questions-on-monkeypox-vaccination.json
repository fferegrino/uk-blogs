We still continue to see new cases in the UK and cases continue to be identified worldwide, particularly throughout Europe, North America, and South America. Until this outbreak, monkeypox was considered a rare disease in these parts of the world."

These include raised awareness leading to more people seeking clinical advice and testing, changes to people\u2019s behaviour and vaccines. While the reduction is certainly good news, we will continue to prioritise this work because we want to stop spread in the UK."

This is used because monkeypox and smallpox viruses are part of the same virus family and this vaccine has been used successfully in previous monkeypox outbreaks."

A single dose is effective at reducing both the risk of developing monkeypox and the severity of symptoms, this will provide some protection to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible."

            "text": "The evidence suggests even one dose reduces the risk of developing monkeypox. One dose should also reduce the severity of symptoms if someone does develop monkeypox. A single dose prepares the immune system to respond much more quickly if exposed to monkeypox."

Some vaccines can also be injected into the upper layer of the skin itself \u2013 this is known as intradermal vaccination. This requires specially trained staff and is done with a much smaller volume, using a smaller needle and syringe."

        {
            "text": "When vaccines are injected into the skin, rather than the muscle, the important proteins in the vaccine are more accessible to the cells of your immune system. This means that your body can make a good response to the vaccine, even with a much smaller dose. This \u2018technique has been used commonly during outbreaks for other infections, such as yellow fever."

            "text": "This safeand clinically-approved approach has been commonly used in other worldwide outbreaks when vaccine supplies are constrained. Intradermal vaccination maximises the number of doses that can be administered without compromising protection, turning one dose of the smallpox vaccine into more."

            "text": "After this smallpox vaccine was approved,\u00a0a study in 2015\u00a0compared different doses and methods of giving the vaccine. Roughly 300 people were randomised to either 0.5mL subcutaneous or 0.1mL intradermally. After the second dose the peak antibody levels were similar and overall response rates were around 95% in both groups. On the basis of this evidence,\u00a0JCVI\u00a0has said that intradermal vaccination is considered equivalent to the standard route."

In the US it was approved for preventing smallpox and monkeypox in 2019. \u00a0The vaccine contains a virus which has been modified so it cannot grow in the human body, it does not contain the smallpox or monkeypox virus, and it cannot spread or cause smallpox or monkeypox."

            "text": "Like all vaccines, it may cause side effects, but most are mild and short-lived \u2013 and not everyone gets them. The vaccine has fewer side effects than the traditional smallpox vaccine and, unlike the traditional vaccine, doesn\u2019t leave a scar."

Common signs of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes, and development of a new rash. This could even be a single blister. People who suspect they may have monkeypox should take a break from sex, stay at home and call 111 or their local sexual health clinic."
