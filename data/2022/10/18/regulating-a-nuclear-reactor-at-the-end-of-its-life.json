She later went on to say that the certainty was what she loved most about the subject. Shutting down the longest running reactor in the UK is certainly not as \u201ccut and dry\u201d. The delicately balanced decisions to be made today have the potential to affect the environmental impact of the station in the future, as it enters the next stage of its life cycle."

There was no \u2018Generic Design Assessment (GDA)\u2019, the process we have now where we and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) scrutinse reactor designs at an early stage. We can identify potential design or technical concerns early on and ask the designer to resolve them ahead of construction."

Before 1996 most environmental regulation of Hinkley Point B was carried out by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) and its predecessors. The big change to environmental regulation of nuclear power stations came in 1996 with the formation of the Environment Agency."

Whist they look back on what the reactor has achieved over the last 46 years, the focus will now be on the safe and environmental optimised removal of the fuel and treatment of wastes."
