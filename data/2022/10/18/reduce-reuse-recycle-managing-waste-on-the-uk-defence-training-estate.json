In the year 2021/22, we sent just 2% of our non-construction waste to landfill, with 20% sent to incineration and 78% recycled (which includes recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion). 87% of construction waste in 2021/22 was recycled, with the remaining 13% sent to landfill. This material was asbestos and stop butt waste which has to be managed in this manner due to its hazardous nature."
