FASTER not only showcases an advanced Platform-as-a-Service concept that enables the loose coupling of small software components (microservices), but also pioneers an equally modern approach to contracting by developing a supplier community that is collaborative, diverse, inclusive, and enabling of all Defence Lines of Development."

The NavyPODS (Navy Persistent Operational Deployment System) concept is being taken forward by the service\u2019s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). It consists\u00a0of\u00a0), and is explained as consisting of \u201cinterchangeable modules that can be fitted to the surface fleet. Similar in design to a shipping container, the PODS create the idea of a \u2018plug and play\u2019 warship. This is delivered, delivered using innovative technology such as heavy-lift drones or autonomous boats. As a result, ships can receive the equipment they need to be re-tasked quicker without going into a port to collect it.\u201d"

They will also be used as medical rooms and command centres. For large platforms such as warships, NavyPODS provide adaptability and versatility. However, a shipping container won\u2019t fit down the hatch of a submarine. So, how can the benefits of NavyPODS be delivered to submarine platforms and other military platforms that cannot easily adapt to this surface fleet model?"

A podular capability is a set of components (across all Defence Lines of Development, not just information technology) that provide a means of sensing, deciding, or affecting. To conduct successful operations, submarines must be able to Float, Move, and Fight at the most basic level. FASTER will deliver future submarine warfighting capability via an evolving set of new functions built into a more flexible, adaptable Combat System. Operators will gain the ability to assemble and update the capabilities they need, supported in their choices by advanced algorithms, models, and data \u2013 potentially including artificial intelligence agents to support operator and command team decision making."

In the past, it has taken far too long for new ideas emerging from the laboratory to reach front-line operations.

            "text": "The above operating model shows that each aspect of the programme design is an Agile cycle. The outputs of these interlinked cycles are podular capabilities, and each turn of the cycles increases their TRLs. In particular, the technology components within podular capabilities come not just with code that performs functions, but with code that verifies the non-functional behaviour of these functions safety, performance, and security. The approach separates out these aspects of system integrity and insists that components first define how they comply with each aspect and then prove it."

            "text": "As the components within a capability get better at doing this, the maturity (TRL) of the new capability increases. Eventually, the podular capability is ready to pass through an expedited assurance and accreditation process. The compliance mechanisms built into each component reduce time, effort, and cost. This ensures that technology developed via FASTER has a streamlined route into operational deployment via an aspect of the programme termed MASTER (Modular Architecture for Submarine Technology Enactment Route). This approach is significantly different to current assurance and accreditation processes, which are applied at platform level. FASTER will work with approval and assurance authorities to adapt existing ways of working to achieve outcomes that are not only robust but also streamlined."
