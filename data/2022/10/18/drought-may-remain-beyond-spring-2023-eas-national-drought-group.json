            "text": "The group, made up of senior decision-makers from the EA, government, water companies and key farming and environmental groups, discussed projections for a dry autumn and winter on the water, agriculture and environment sectors in 2023. Many water companies have suggested impending drought or drought conditions will remain beyond spring in some areas \u2013 notably in parts of the South West, South East, East and Yorkshire and East Midlands - if rainfall is below average."

Due to soils remaining drier than usual, this has made limited difference to river, groundwater and reservoir levels which remain low - demonstrating that recent rainfall has not changed the underlying drought situation caused by the prolonged dry weather of the last several months."

The package of measures to assist farmers\u00a0announced this summer, which continues through this winter, includes water trading between farmers in catchments to help improve access to water, as well as the temporary ability to abstract additional water where it doesn\u2019t\u00a0impact existing abstractions or\u00a0harm the environment."

On Friday the NDG identified a set of actions to help accelerate delivery of new water infrastructure and the water security it will help to ensure."
