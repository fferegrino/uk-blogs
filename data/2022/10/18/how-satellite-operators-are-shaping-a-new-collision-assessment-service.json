            "text": "During the early stages of the project, we hosted over 20 user research sessions, engaging with around 75% of all UK-licensed satellite operators at the time. This helped us to develop a service that plugged a gap in existing Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) offerings and addressed some of the pain points in current processes, one of which being receiving multiple alerts for the same event."

Operators identified additional analysis provided by our expert orbital analysts as a huge asset. Therefore, we continue working with orbital analysts to provide more information and trial allowing operators to contact them regarding their analysis."

Since then, we have on boarded three more operators; AAC Clyde Space, Astroscale and Space Forge, and look forward to hearing their insights on how the service could best work for them."
