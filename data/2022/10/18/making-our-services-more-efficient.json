While the last few years has seen sharp changes in economic fortunes, the fluctuations in the property market is nothing new.

We\u2019ve been doing that through record levels of recruiting and training, with hundreds of additional caseworkers joining our teams over the last few years.We believe it\u2019s the right thing to do, and we have been starting to see improvements despite the high levels of demand for our services over the last two years.
