That\u2019s what hybrid cloud really means to us: a culture shift of moving people to that single operating model. We have a mixed landscape, and increasingly we have more cloud native services. But we still have a fairly strong legacy footprint that has to be respected with regard to how we maintain those services. \u00a0"
