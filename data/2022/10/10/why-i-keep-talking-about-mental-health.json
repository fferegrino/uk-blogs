            "text": "There\u2019s also an awareness week in May, and earmarked dates like Schizophrenia Awareness Day (always in July). Have we not exhausted the topic of mental health and ticked all the right boxes? Or opened up and offered a listening ear that solves all the emotional problems?"

            "text": "The answer is \u2018no\u2019, we haven\u2019t yet reached a point where we can afford to stop talking about mental health. Some of us might be familiar with the phrase \u2018one in four adults experience mental ill-health in any given year\u2019. However, that household survey was conducted in 2009, and personally I believe it to be higher now, given the uncertainty and challenges we have faced since."

        {
            "text": "Covid certainly didn\u2019t help reduce that ratio, with some organisations now referring to mental health as the other, second or hidden pandemic. For example, the text support service \u2018Shout 85258\u2019 saw the need for their service doubling from early 2020 to early 2021."

            "text": "Covid also put a further strain on waiting times for support services, with research by the Royal College of Psychiatrists discovering that almost a quarter on waiting lists end up waiting for more than three months. The same research found that unsurprisingly, as a consequence, more people in need now end up contacting emergency or crisis services for support."

These are astonishing numbers \u2013 and I\u2019m one of those.\nI don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s any different to my chronic neck pain, or the time in my life when my tonsils caused me a lot of grief. I too have mental health as part of the package that makes up me. Sometimes, like this summer and autumn, I experience pain and problems."

I\u2019ve felt safe from stigma or discrimination and able to say when I\u2019m not feeling OK to colleagues, including senior ones, and actually been supported by many of them, which I\u2019m very grateful for."

The supportive culture we have means I can also have that appointment open in my diary without having to fear judgement or \u2018jokes\u2019."
