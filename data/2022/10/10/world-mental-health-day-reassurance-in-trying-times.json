I know I would feel a little more at ease if some of the news items appearing in my social media feed were foreseeable although, unfortunately, much of what I read or hear is thoroughly unpredictable and often quite disturbing."

New research commissioned by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) reveals almost seven in 10 people in the UK report regularly experiencing the \u2018Sunday Scaries\u2019."
