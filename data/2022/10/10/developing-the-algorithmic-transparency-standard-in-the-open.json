It provides a framework to enable public sector bodies to share information on their use of algorithmic tools with the public and interested stakeholders. In doing so, the Standard will help to realise the potential of these technologies by increasing organisations\u2019 confidence to make use of effective algorithmic tools.\u00a0"
