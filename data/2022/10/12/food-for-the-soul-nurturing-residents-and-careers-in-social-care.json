My main aim is to make sure our residents receive an enriched dining experience, with diets tailored to each individual. On an average day, I\u2019ll work with my incredible kitchen team to take in food deliveries, coordinate specialist menus (three meals a day) and even arrange afternoon tea."

For example, one symptom that can manifest is dysphagia, where a person has difficulty swallowing. This of course means that we have to make sure their food is prepared and cooked correctly for them to be able to eat and enjoy it."

            "text": "Seeing the smiles on the residents\u2019 faces as they enjoy my food gives me so much enjoyment and I couldn\u2019t ask for more. It\u2019s a mutual relationship, where we provide the care and support our residents and families need and we receive the gratification we\u2019re having a positive impact on their lives."
