However, this is only in proportion to the number of stables on the site. Any extra items that are not generally expected on a site, such as horse walkers and arenas, are then added to the valuation as an \u2018other addition\u2019. Stable requirements differ for every site, and every valuation will reflect the specific make-up of the stables being valued."

The local council then uses this rateable value to work out how much the site is liable to pay in business rates. This includes applying any reliefs that they qualify for. In practice, these reliefs mean most private stables don\u2019t pay any business rates at all."
