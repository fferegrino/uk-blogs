It will move away from legacy systems, and adopt the use of intelligent data and optimisation of supply chain relationships to ensure access to the most modern equipment.\u00a0\u00a0"

Boxer further supports the ambition of \u2018Future Soldier\u2019 which sought to reconfigure the army around the emerging Armoured Brigade Combat Team concept.

We also support the application of IPA tools and guidance which have been developed through data gathered from other major programmes. This ensures collective insights and lessons learned from across government\u2019s major programmes are being fed back into the system to set programmes up for success."
