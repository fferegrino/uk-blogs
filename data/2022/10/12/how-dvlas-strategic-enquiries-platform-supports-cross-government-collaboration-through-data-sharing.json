The service, which was piloted in 2019, allows police officers to access the photograph held on DVLA\u2019s driver database through their police issued mobile devices, enabling them to confirm the correct identity of a driver almost instantly."

Our driver data is currently live, and we\u2019ve just started work on providing vehicle data through private beta testing. We\u2019ve had great feedback from the police about the service, which is in pilot with Cheshire and North Yorkshire forces, and this will ultimately save the police time and money."

In July 2021, we released a series of APIs to support their theory test booking service, helping DVSA ensure candidates have the correct and valid entitlement to take the relevant theory test. This confirms that the person attending the test is qualified to do so. The service has already handled more than 17 million enquiries."

The data can now be automatically transferred onto DVSA\u2019s system, ensuring it is accurately recorded. Additionally, the service allows driving examiners to check the driving licence entitlements of candidates attending driving tests, helping to reduce test impersonations and driving test fraud."
