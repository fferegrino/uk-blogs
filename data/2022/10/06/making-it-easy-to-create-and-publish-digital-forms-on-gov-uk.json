            "text": "Now in private beta, GOV.UK Forms is supporting a number of partners to easily create accessible, digital forms in minutes. Our users are people working in government who build and use forms, typically to collect information which enables somebody to access a government service. This is a really common need across the civil service. So it\u2019s crucial that our users do not need to have any technical background to create online forms."

Our first partner is the Redundancy Payments Service (RPS) team in the Insolvency Service."

This is one of six forms that can be used to amend a claim if you need to update the information you\u2019ve already provided."

These are all features our private beta partners require, so they\u2019re the next ones we\u2019re planning to design, build and test. And the Insolvency Service will be working on digital versions of the remaining RPS forms soon too."

            "text": "Many of these forms are difficult or impossible to fill out for some users, for example those with certain visual, cognitive, mobility or neurological disabilities. And whilst there are well-designed PDF forms which are on the whole better, even these still do not meet government accessibility requirements, which are to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA standard."

We think that by providing tried and tested components and patterns - for example a confirmation page that advises an applicant what happens next after filling in a form, radio buttons to select an option, or email validation - we can help form creators to achieve this goal."

This is helpful as it encourages us all to share learnings as well as to focus on the different problems we are tackling. For example, our team is targeting a wider user base, including people in government with zero tech background, so we are focusing on providing GOV.UK Forms as an easy-to-use self-serve platform."
