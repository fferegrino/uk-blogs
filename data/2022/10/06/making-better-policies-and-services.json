For example, if I want to visit my friend in prison, I\u2019ll probably search Google to find out how to book a visit. Coming across\u00a0the GOV.UK page for High Down prison, I\u2019ll discover that I can now book a video call instead, if I want to. If I still want to visit in person, I\u2019ll call the prison phone number and talk to someone to book my visit."

I may or may not pay a fee, or incur other costs to use them. The components of the service are operated by various prison staff. All of that should be thought through and thoroughly tested, to make sure the whole service works and everyone is able to visit someone in prison as easily and cost-effectively as possible. And this service, like all others, is dependent on countless other services to function."

And so policymakers tasked with achieving certain outcomes for society must understand how services function, and be able to understand how systems of services and individuals and organisations function, if they are going to make meaningful progress toward achieving those objectives. They should work closely with the people who are designing and implementing those services."

Our service-design teams often acted like an internal consultancy, agreeing a problem statement and project brief with a policy team, then conducting the research and design activities needed to better understand how to improve the situation, and returning with a series of insights and recommendations. That is powerful, valuable work that helps policymakers better understand the problem spaces they\u2019re working in, and make better decisions about how to improve things."

That level of engagement enables us to build in their perspectives, often around the feasibility or viability of an idea, into our recommendations for how to improve the system. And it gives policymakers a much more realistic understanding of the services and systems people engage with."

Our service community teams are thinking about how they can steward the whole system to provide better outcomes for people leaving prison and for society as a whole. They know they need to work not just across central government agencies but also with the health sector, local government authorities, accommodation providers, social enterprises, local businesses, community groups, and more\u2026 because none of these institutions can achieve their goals alone, and government can\u2019t achieve its goals without all of them."

If they\u2019re constantly working to improve specific parts of the system, while keeping an eye on how the overall system reacts and evolves after each new change, we\u2019ll slowly but surely improve the state of our national detention and rehabilitation system. We\u2019re still at the early stages of this work, but this feels to me like what \u2018policy design\u2019 should look like."
