At DEC we come together as 8 organisations to break down silos and deliver on levelling up and greater prosperity for the UK.\u00a0"

Over the next few years, we\u00a0look forward to expanding our small DDaT Darlington team further. \u00a0"

We visit independent coffee houses in Darlington (the Star Wars themed one is a favourite), and enjoy team lunches in the local marketplace (street food stalls are popular). Our events usually involve drinking coffee and eating baked goods! We have also held an online Christmas event, a jubilee afternoon tea and a summer picnic in a local rugby club.\u00a0"

We also have 3 paid volunteering days at DIT, so we use these to get involved with local volunteering opportunities as a team. These range from litter picking to helping with painting and general maintenance at local care homes and sheltered housing complexes. We also conduct outreach sessions to local schools and colleges - Kathy (pictured below) recently represented DDaT at Yarm School. \u00a0"

Darlington itself has affordable housing and there are lovely villages surrounding it, with an easy commute if you don\u2019t want to live right in the heart of the town. With good schools and lots of green space, Darlington is an easy town to move across as traffic congestion is only at peak travel times. There are also good cycle-to-work pathways for those who enjoy cycling to the office.\u00a0"

This helps us to feel connected to Westminster, and many of our London-based colleagues are keen to come to Darlington and work collaboratively. They also discover the beautiful countryside, miles of beaches and fresh air in the area at the same time!\u00a0"
