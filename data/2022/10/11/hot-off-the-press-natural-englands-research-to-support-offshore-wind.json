            "text": "Natural England has just published several research reports to inform and support the sustainable development of offshore windfarms, contributing to economic growth and energy security. This package of research will provide evidence that supports the government\u2019s vision for 50GW of offshore wind by 2030, including 5GW of floating wind as included in the British energy security strategy. Sound evidence applied early is key to enabling timely decision-making throughout the consenting process. It supports our vision of thriving marine and coastal nature alongside low impact offshore wind energy, tackling both climate and biodiversity emergencies as set out in Natural England\u2019s Approach to Offshore Wind."
