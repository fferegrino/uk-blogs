These approaches are well suited to complex, persistent and systemic challenges like those faced by policymakers working on aspects of climate change - as we set out in recent posts about art in policy, systems mapping and co-design."

            "text": "In November 2021 we established a Collective Intelligence Lab (CILab), with the aim of improving policy outcomes by tapping into collective intelligence (CI). We define CI as the diversity of thought and experience that is distributed across groups of people, from public servants and domain experts to members of the public. We have been experimenting with a digital tool, Pol.is, to capture diverse perspectives and new ideas on key government priority areas. To date we have run eight debates on issues as diverse as Civil Service modernisation, fisheries management and national security. Across these debates over 2400 civil servants, subject matter experts and members of the public have participated. We will be blogging about some of these areas in coming months. This post sets out our approach to CI so far, and describes three ways in which we think it helps to develop policy in complex settings."

Participants can therefore frame the discussion more in their own terms than they can in many other modes of engagement."

This is well suited to testing public and expert opinions on current policy proposals, especially where their success depends on securing buy-in and action from stakeholders. It can also help collate views and identify barriers to effective implementation of existing policy."

            "text": "From the initial set of eight CILab policy debates, we have learnt that it is sometimes useful to design a \u2018crossover point' into the process. This is where part way through a debate, statements submitted by policymakers, subject matter experts and members of the public can be shown to each other, in a bid to break down groupthink across those groups. We used this approach in a Pol.is debate on a topic relating to UK foreign policy, and think it could help test how existing policies on complex areas such as climate change or social care are perceived within and outside government."

By harnessing the ideas of a diverse group of people beyond those who traditionally contribute to policymaking, a CI exercise could help reveal new ideas to be tested. CI has already identified novel climate change solutions. For example, a teenage participant in the Climate CoLab, another CI initiative, won funding to scale up an innovative rainwater-powered sun-tracking solar panel through outreach in the developing world.\u00a0"

Combined with traditional methods such as focus groups, and more innovative methods such as co-design, CILab debates can encourage participants to put forward new ideas for policy teams to develop into policies, services or other interventions."
