If data is the fuel of this revolution, software is the engine. And while innovation in military hardware continues at pace, it's software that's changing the character of conflict altogether. It's software that will deliver the decisive competitive edge and long-term strategic advantage. In light of this, our governments, security services and armed forces are striving to transform how they plan, train and operate. Why? Because unlike hardware it\u2019s rapidly and almost infinitely adaptable, able to keep pace with the changing threat and make innovation immediately available to the warfighter.\u00a0"
