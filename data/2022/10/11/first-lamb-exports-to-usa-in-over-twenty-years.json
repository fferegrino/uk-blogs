As part of the announcement, Food and Farming Minister Mark Spencer was interviewed by Bauer media for their suite of radio stations, which include the Absolute stations as well as Magic and Top Hits. He outlined how significant this move is for lamb farmers, and called it a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d for the high-quality and animal welfare standards of the British lamb industry."
