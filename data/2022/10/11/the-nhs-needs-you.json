Yet lockdown measures are still in place in some parts of the world."

Not in financial terms, but in the pure sense of the word, those who suffer bad fortune, people who are simply struck with bad luck. And any one of us, no matter our circumstances, can be struck by bad luck at any time, as can our loved ones."

According to NHS Blood and Transplant, around 135,000 new donors are needed every year in England to ensure demand can be met. It\u2019s needed more than ever."
