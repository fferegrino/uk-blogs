            "text": "Mindsets look at the behavioural tensions of users which help us understand how they may approach certain tasks. By uncovering and understanding the linking of these tensions we can much better understand users. The methodology focuses on underlying psychology and personality traits, which are much more stable than traditional socio-demographic segmentations."

As such, we partnered with Fjord, Accenture who had success with a methodology called mindsets."

Since then, we have completed another two mindsets projects which have focused on different user groups."
