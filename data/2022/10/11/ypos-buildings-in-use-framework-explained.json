This buying option has been set up as a DPS or \u2018Dynamic Purchasing System\u2019. A DPS is a procurement technique used by the public sector to purchase commonly used goods, works or services. A DPS differs from a framework because it\u2019s open to new suppliers to join at any time, as long as they meet selection criteria. This means any new or local suppliers can apply to join at any time. It is open to and suitable for both national and regional suppliers."
