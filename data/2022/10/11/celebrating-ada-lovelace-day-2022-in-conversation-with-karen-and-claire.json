Helping my team is what I enjoy the most \u2013 my job includes removing obstacles or \u2018blockers\u2019 to progress, helping the team to self-organise and creating a culture of learning and transparency."

It has provided me the opportunity to collaborate with highly skilled, passionate, and creative people from across the organisation -\u00a0I really enjoy working with them!

I have a degree in business and a postgraduate degree in law and I was able to transfer a lot of skills gained throughout my career over to my current role. For example, part of a lawyer\u2019s role is case management, which follows similar steps to that of managing a project - the only difference is the subject. I have found that the sector values\u00a0people from diverse backgrounds, with transferable skills, and a motivation to work in technology."

I\u2019ve worked in retail as a sales assistant, call centres and on to senior leadership positions. One thing that has remained consistent across all these roles is my passion for customer service and solving complex problems. Technology is a great enabler to provide solutions for these problems. There are so many transferrable skills that you gain across so many different aspects of your life."
