The process of submitting a query was very quick and simple, which I wasn\u2019t expecting because in my experience there are usually various pages to get through with these kinds of things, plus the occasional log in process! However, in this instance, I was taken straight to the enquiry form which then only took around 5 minutes to complete."

I was expecting to have to wait a few days for a response, but I received a call from the team that same day and they quickly arranged a virtual meeting to go through my requirements in more detail, which was extremely helpful."

The school business manager role is so unique, and you manage so many things, sometimes it feels that you are barely scratching the surface. I wanted to get this right and make sure it was compliant. I also wanted to get value for money."
