Our objective is to support government-funded organisations and government departments in their management of intangible assets, such as intellectual property and knowhow, including their development and value creation. The potential value of knowledge assets was set out in the Mackintosh Report of 2021 and this was followed by publication of the Rose Book in the same year. The Rose Book explains the concepts and practicalities behind managing knowledge assets in government and the public sector.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "As GOTT, our role is to provide guidance and to offer practical advice and support across government to help organisations develop their knowledge assets strategies and to become more effective at identifying and developing their intangible assets for adoption. That might mean sharing them across government, using them in collaboration with the private sector, offering external advisory services or through commercialisation - for example, licensing to an existing organisation or even creating a new company. \u00a0"

Before that I worked in UK public and private sector research commercialisation. I\u2019m coming into GOTT at an exciting time. The wealth of knowledge assets across the public sector and their potential to drive innovation, productivity and growth is significant.\u00a0\u00a0"

I\u2019ve seen the value of the GOTT Knowledge Asset Grant Fund to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) in exploring projects with significant commercial and societal benefit. And I have learned about business processes developed in the Department for Education that have been adopted by HM Treasury which, for both Departments, have driven efficiency, saved \u00a3millions and improved job satisfaction. \u00a0"

We also manage the Knowledge Asset Grant Fund (KAGF), that can offer up to \u00a3250,000 towards the development of commercially attractive opportunities. And we have access to a dedicated public sector seed fund, UKI2S, that can invest in knowledge assets-based spin out companies. We\u2019re also planning to develop training to support knowledge asset and IP identification and exploitation in the public sector context. GOTT is a small team and, as we develop, it will be important to work with partners across the public and private sectors to leverage capability. \u00a0"

It\u2019s a mine of useful information and really sets the context. After that, I\u2019d say - contact us in GOTT and we can explore how best to support you through your knowledge assets journey.\u00a0\u00a0"
