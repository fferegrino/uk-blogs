Members are public-sector organisations who share a common interest in marine geospatial information. The UK CSM, which is administered by the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO), has a core focus on bathymetry and associated data. The UK CSM aims to enable a more unified voice to promote seabed mapping and the resultant data, as the foundation data set for the marine environment, and as a key element of the UK\u2019s national infrastructure."

            "text": "This will be achieved through increased coverage, quality and access of seabed mapping data collected from public money or in collaboration with industry. The UK CSM is also a UK government voluntary commitment to the UN Ocean Decade, and goes hand in hand with the UKHO support of the Nippon Foundation GEBCO Seabed 2030 project."
