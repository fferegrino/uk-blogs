I've recently taken on the role and I'm really enjoying the challenge. I'd like to think I practice what I preach having undertaken a Human Resources (HR) apprenticeship when I first joined the MOD. It\u2019s also in the blood as my dad joined the MOD as an electrical engineering apprentice at RAF Sealand way back in 1982!"

In February, we hosted our Apprenticeship Awards at HMNB Portsmouth, and were lucky enough to receive not only a guided tour around the site, but also an onboard tour of HMS Prince of Wales, one of the Royal Navy\u2019s latest Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. Our apprentices were shown around the ship\u2019s bridge, flight island, hangar and flight deck in what was a real money-can\u2019t-buy experience, as well as a welcome reminder of the personnel we support and the military capability DIO enables."

It also highlighted the vital role of the Defence Training Estate in helping to prepare the UK military for operations worldwide."

[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]Apprenticeships play a vital role in DIO, supporting the development of talented individuals into a variety of roles requiring specialist knowledge, skills and behaviours. Taking time to invest in growing our own capability is crucial, as is ensuring staff feel valued and part of a team while they are learning and training on the job. We have an exciting range of apprenticeships on offer, which reflect the breath of professions across DIO. To list just a few, these include property, leadership, project delivery, finance, policy, operational delivery, commercial, digital and HR."
