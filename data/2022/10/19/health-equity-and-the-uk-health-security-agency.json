And during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, men and women from Bangladeshi backgrounds were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than people of White British backgrounds\u2013 even after accounting for differences in age, sex, deprivation and pre-existing health status."

One of the first steps is to ensure that everyone who works in the organisation and our external health partners understands their role in tackling health inequalities.
