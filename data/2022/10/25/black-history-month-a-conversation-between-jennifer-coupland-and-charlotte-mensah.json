            "text": "From the age of seven to 10, I knew I would do something in business. My grandfather used to run a brewery in Ghana, so I would always see what he was doing\u2026 Then when I was 13, my mum died. It was such a difficult time for us, we were living in the UK by then. I took over doing my sister\u2019s hair because it made me still feel connected to her."

            "text": "In 1971, the first black hair salon opened in the UK - Splinters, and I jumped at the chance to join. I was at a job fair at my school and saw the poster. I also trained one day a week at the London College of Fashion under the youth training scheme by Margaret Thatcher, 1986-88. Then I started to hop\u00a0around because I wanted to learn lots of skills. At the age of 25, I rented my own chair in a business centre in Kilburn Park Road \u2013 it didn\u2019t have a shop front, but I was still able to build a client base, which I then moved to my home to be close to my son. I finally opened my own high street salon in 2003."

            "text": "It was hard to achieve because every time I asked the landlord about renting it, he said the space was unavailable. But I kept walking past and seeing it empty. Eventually, I asked my white friend to ring him, and he got the place straightaway. When I confronted the landlord \u2013 showing him my business accounts, he was ashamed. He had assumed I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it."

            "text": "My door is now open to everyone who walks through, I treat all hair types, but it\u2019s also a safe space for women of colour because all the hair salons on the high street, all the hair brands; the magazines \u2013 every part of the industry needs to be more inclusive."

            "text": "The campaign that everyone should learn all types of hair is a good one, but the big brands need to have more people of colour in their decision making. We are not going to get anywhere if it\u2019s just those at the bottom trying to fix things?"

        {
            "text": "We are also discussing how to look after hair properly. Some of the assessments, for example, the time that they give is too short when treating black hair. As a route panel member, I\u2019ve been able to explain this, and it\u2019s been updated."
        },
        {
            "text": "Maybe our route panel needs to go to primary schools to teach them the idea of vocation. I see a big difference between the UK and Ghana, where I go regularly because I have a charity there in memory of my mother. Everyone in Ghana is encouraged to learn a vocation. But young people in the UK all want to be their own boss too quickly and this has increased post pandemic. There\u2019s a system to things, you must learn the foundation first and we need to promote that more. I am so grateful for the training I had when I was younger."
