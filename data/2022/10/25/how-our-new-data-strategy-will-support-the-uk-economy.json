By making our data easy to find, access, use and combine with other data, it will provide maximum value for the UK. We\u2019ll do this through greater use of application programming interfaces, Unique Property Reference Numbers and machine readability."

Alongside this, we aim to increase the quality of our data so it\u2019s more valuable to a larger number of users. We hold a critical national asset and are responsible for allowing the nation to access and use it as effectively as possible."

Application programming interfaces (APIs) obviously come into play here, so we are currently refining a strategy for this and designing the necessary infrastructure to make it happen."

Combining HM Land Registry data with other land information results in powerful data which is vital to a sustainable economy."

A couple of our datasets, such as the National Polygon Service and the Registered Lease Dataset, already include UPRNs, but our aim is to add them more widely to other datasets, despite the challenge that UPRNs do not correlate easily with our property titles!"

For example, SearchLand combines HM Land Registry data with information from other providers such as the National Grid, Companies House and the Environment Agency to save their clients hundreds of hours per month searching multiple sources. This is particularly useful for property professionals wanting to identify off-market sites that can be developed for new homes or wanting to investigate the development opportunities of existing buildings."
