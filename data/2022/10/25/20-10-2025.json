It was a little black Nokia 3310 that made calls and did text messages quite badly. I was in my last year of university and had to go to Appleton Tower to use a computer that was quite clunky and slow. When we could afford takeaways we would have to find a paper menu, call them and then patiently wait for it to arrive, constantly getting up and checking out the window every time there was a sound outside. Banking was either done through a long wait on the phone or via a branch. I didn\u2019t ever have to interact with Justice Services but I do remember having to go to the post office to pick up forms to use other government services - things like driving licence and passport.\u00a0"

My Magistrates Court (Wimbledon) had just installed office automation, i.e. we had email, word and excel and no longer had to share a VDU to \u2018use the computer\u2019. Audio conferencing was available, some sites had a dial up video conferencing, whilst good for the time was poor by modern standards. Email started to replace the post and fax for document sharing. Mobile phones were far from smart, colleagues could talk, not all could text, some had a torch. Apps were called case management systems and hosted locally on site or in data centres. HQ moved into 102 Petty France, Wi-Fi was non-existent, and users relied on different coloured data cables depending on domain, some readers will remember bright pink cables used for Libra!"

The collaboration possibilities were now endless, files could now be shared across several different parts of the MOJ. The pandemic witnessed an upgrade to the Teams platform vastly improving the video meeting space. Many colleagues can now work successfully away from the office with up to date technology. The journey continues with deployment of more modern technology and software to prison service colleagues. Landline telephone can now be provided through Microsoft Teams allowing colleagues to use their laptops for calls."
