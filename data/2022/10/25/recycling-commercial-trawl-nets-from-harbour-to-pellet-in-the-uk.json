            "text": "The project was successful in recycling a huge amount of net, but this was always fairly labour intensive for a group of volunteers from Torbay Cleaner Coasts Initiative who would strip the nets of all un-recyclable materials such as chain, rope and debris to prepare them. The net was then sent off to Denmark once or twice a year to be recycled by Plastix Global, who returned them to plastic pellet form to create other products. Another issue with this method was the amount of storage required at Brixham port for processed net due for collection."

            "text": "Over the years Torbay Harbour Authority supported and then took over the preparation of the nets for recycling and remained fully onboard with the project, supporting those who were trying to find other solutions to the circular economy. From a partnership between Torbay Harbour Authority, Keep Britain Tidy and Milspeed Ltd. has led to a breakthrough for Milspeed to be the first plant in England to be able to recycle HDPE commercial fishing nets."

Businesses in the UK are being supported in collecting material from beaches and harbours, having pellet created and manufacturing products from it."

The trawl nets from Brixham travel just 150 miles from Harbour to processor before being made into a recycled pellet. It\u2019s fantastic that the nets can be utilised right here in England. We\u2019ve spent a long time assisting the development of this new system and great credit goes to the processor and all involved at Brixham harbour for their hard work tackling what is a difficult material to recycle\u2019."

KBT have acquired funding to support other UK harbours, local groups and organisations to set-up recycling of fishing material. Funds are available to set up collection systems at harbourside and to cover transportation costs. Milspeed are keen to slowly expand the operation as they grow the market for the recycled pellets."
