At the time, I was working for the Irish passport and visa office, and I just wanted a change. I wanted something where I could progress. I saw the advert for Case Administrators and thought \u201cthis sounds really interesting\u201d. So, I applied and got the role! \u00a0I went on to work as a Case Administrator for about three years."

            "text": "Like I mentioned, no two days are the same: you could be dealing with people that are going through a crisis that turn up at the office or be on the phone and be really agitated. So, enjoying a challenge and communication skills are key. Most importantly, you have to be a team player, you have to want to pull together, work together."

I've not come from an academic background and because I've not gone to university or got a degree, I thought this would be a barrier in obtaining a career or advancing myself. Actually, joining the Probation Service really opened my eyes to the fact that you don't need to be from an academic background to have a career. The training and the support are there for you to progress. So, I think it's important that people that don't come from an academic background or don't want to have to do that route know that there's very much a place for them in the Probation Service."
