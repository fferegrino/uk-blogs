The programmes, over two years, have included a radio drama, \u2018The History of Mary Prince\u2019, the story of first black woman, an abolitionist, to publish an account of her life in Britain. There was also the animated short feature \u2018Tunstall\u2019, the story of Samuel Barber, the first black British preacher in primitive methodism in Staffordshire. This slotted into our annual Staffordshire History Festival programme and drew attention to Staffordshire\u2019s own place in the history of black people in Britain. The film seasons have also explored \u2018The Horrors of Slavery\u2019 in an experimental animation and \u2018The Cato Street Conspiracy. There have also been films exploring the life of \u2018The Chartist\u2019 William Cuffay and \u2018William Sharpe\u2019, leader of the 1831 Christmas Rebellion in Jamaica and the life of the radical black preacher, Robert Wedderburn."

The project started just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, meaning the timeline was longer than expected due to the various lockdowns.

Black people of all ages are asked the same two and a half questions (plus a bonus one) \u2013 How has your race shaped who you are? What is your hope for the future? How old are you? What do you do? Each person has a story to tell, from 14 year olds to 86 year olds. A shared experience from the people interviewed seemed to be a shift in awareness of their race when they came to Britain for the first time; \u201cit was only in Britain that I became Black\u201d. It was something they had not had to think of before. The interviewees in the film shared their experiences from school, the workplace, some even looking at their children\u2019s experiences today. The film gave real insight into the harsh realities faced; the racism experienced, the need to work twice as hard to get anywhere, the idea that they will always be seen as being \u2018other\u2019."
