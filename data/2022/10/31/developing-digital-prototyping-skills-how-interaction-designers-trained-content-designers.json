We then move these ideas to design software like Figma. Now many of us are working remotely, we move to digital prototypes more quickly as they help us to work collaboratively."

Many had past experience of coding so we ran a refresher on the basics of HTML, as well as introducing the kit and how to work collaboratively. We agreed that content designers would usually need to edit an existing prototype created by interaction designers on their team."

We followed Joe\u2019s lead in introducing HTML, covering the basics of tags, attributes, nesting and indentation. One of the most important lessons of all being to close your tags!"

The tutorial is a great introduction to the kit, where you learn basic prototyping skills like creating pages and linking them together, before moving on to more advanced techniques like branching and passing data."

            "text": "We all had some experience of coding, usually dating back to when we had to use code to publish content in old content management systems. So, it was more a case of refreshing our memories than learning new code."

To make sure we build on what we\u2019ve already learnt, we\u2019ll be having another training session soon. We\u2019re also making prototyping training part of our onboarding process as we expand our interaction and content design teams."
