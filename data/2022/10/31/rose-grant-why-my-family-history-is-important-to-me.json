Dad was a skilled carpenter, with a passion for politics, who worked in building and construction. One of his jobs was fitting brass locks and doorknobs in the Houses of Parliament \u2013 they\u2019re probably still there!"

My super woman and role model, she never complained and always manged to keep the household in order with her traditional Jamaican principles in our British home."

Well, that five-year plan manifested into 70 plus years, and they even planned to return to Jamaica in their retirement."

They welcomed others into our family home and wherever we lived, all our neighbours, regardless of their origins, became a part of our extended family. Mum would always have a plate of Jamaican cuisine ready to share with them."

Despite not getting into politics, he really hoped that one day he could be a candidate for the local Labour party; he followed the politics in both Jamaica and the UK. Our local Labour MP often dropped by, and Mum would feed him with a plate of curry goat and rice."

Having spent lots of time with them, I can relate to British farmers, as they work the land and supply natural food for others. From moving around the department, I recognise just how important it is to the lives of people in the UK, and the part Defra plays in protecting and improving agriculture and the environment, making the UK a better place for its citizens."

In turn this means we are all contributing to improving the inclusive culture of our workplace."
