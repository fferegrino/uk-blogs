Since mentors can access all the ECF training modules in advance, they can use any of the lead provider resources they need to do this. We have also built up a bank of resources mentors can use including recordings of training sessions and exemplar lessons. ECTs are encouraged to film themselves teaching and critique in discussion with their mentors. This can negate the need for live observations if timetabling is a challenge.\u201d\u00a0"

We make sure to discuss them often and help them see how to apply their knowledge in different contexts. This helps mentors too \u2013 our school has an established culture of lifelong learning and participating in ECF training is a vital aspect of that.\u201d\u00a0"
