I work in the South Central region, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight. Most of the time, I work in Oxfordshire, but I also cover other areas if needed. I work 4 days a week, including one day every weekend \u2013 paid at a higher rate. I also work extra days when overtime is available."

So, after a quick check in the morning, I drive to the site I\u2019ll be working at. If there are people on probation who can\u2019t make their own way there, I\u2019ll take them in the minibus too."

Chatting to people gives me more of a sense of what\u2019s going on in their lives and to identify any additional support they might need to turn their lives around. This helps me signpost them to helpful services such as a local food bank or training opportunity, for example."

Whether it\u2019s about something light-hearted such as what everyone\u2019s favourite doughnut is, or something more serious such as mental health, it\u2019s a good opportunity for people to see things from others\u2019 perspectives.

One minute, I could be showing a group how to dig and line a pond. The next, I\u2019ll be on a call to a probation officer (PO) about something I\u2019ve picked up during a one-to-one conversation with someone that I think their PO should know about. Then I might have to deal with someone who\u2019s anxious, upset, or angry \u2013 which is often because they\u2019re not confident about doing the task they\u2019ve been set."
