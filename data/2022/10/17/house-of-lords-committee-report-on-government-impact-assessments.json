            "text": "Independent RPC scrutiny has a significant impact on the quality of the IAs that are laid in Parliament. As we commented\u00a0recently, the figures in our recent corporate report show that around 23% of final stage IAs are NOT fit-for-purpose as initially submitted and 56% have a WEAK or VERY WEAK quality rating implying inadequate support for decision-making. However following our scrutiny, only a handful have remained not fit-for-purpose. This demonstrates a real value added from independent scrutiny of Final Stage IAs and we are therefore pleased that the SLSC recommends that \u201cGiven the improvements to IAs by RPC scrutiny it may be premature to remove validation from Final Stage IAs as the BRE review proposes\u201d. This recommendation is echoed by business and civil society organisations in the value they attach to independent scrutiny of Final Stage IAs."

As the SLSC point out, IAs and RPC opinions are meant to be produced in time to inform both ministerial decisions and parliamentary scrutiny. As Stephen and Andrew reported in their evidence, we are seeing too many cases where IAs are being submitted after ministerial and parliamentary decisions have been made."

            "text": "We recognise the value of our opinions to Parliament and the wider stakeholder community. We would certainly prefer that both the IA and the RPC opinion are published together and before the relevant Bill or Statutory Instrument is introduced to Parliament. Clearly, the Government should announce its own policies, rather than the RPC, through our opinions; but after the legislation is introduced to Parliament, we will consider publishing our opinions even in the absence of the associated IA. We also want to do more to highlight red-rated IAs. We will formally respond to this recommendation following consultation with our stakeholders."
