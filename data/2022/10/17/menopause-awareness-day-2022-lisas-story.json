My mum had just been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and I was caring for her and I noticed that I was just forgetting stuff all the time. People would tell me things or even in social situations where people would tell me about their kids and I just couldn't remember their kids names. And so at that point, I genuinely thought my mum's got Alzheimer's and I think I'm getting Alzheimer's too.\u00a0"

Nobody said this to me. Nobody made me feel uncomfortable. I just felt it myself because I could not go anywhere without a notepad. As soon as someone spoke to me, I had to write it down. I had my own tricks for coping at work but after reaching out to a colleague I\u2019d spoken to in the office one day, I decided to start doing some research and reach out for help.\u00a0"
