            "text": "To celebrate, we\u2019ve held 220 NNR events this year with partner organisations, communities, and many volunteers. \u00a0In the north west there have been lots of inspiring arts based events including the \u2018Once Upon a Planet\u2019 exhibition at Tullie House Museum and Gallery in Carlisle, developed alongside partners, local artists and young people to raise awareness of climate change, citizenship, and Cumbria\u2019s rich biodiversity."

With the help of our partners and fantastic volunteers, our NNRs will tackle the big twin challenges of our time: nature recovery and climate change.\u00a0 In doing so, they will enhance the many benefits for us \u2013 our enjoyment, our health and wellbeing, our understanding of the natural world, and benefits to the local economy."

            "text": "Many of our NNRs are at the heart of even larger scale collaborative Nature Recovery Projects (NRPs) \u2013 designed to recover nature beyond protected sites to restore entire ecosystems. Looking ahead, Defra and Natural England are investing over \u00a32.4million in 12 landscape-scale NRPs across the country.\u00a0 These will all large partnerships, focussing on delivering nature recovery and resilience to climate change, enabling wildlife to recover and thrive, and improving livelihoods and local economies. \u00a0At their heart, they will provide natural solutions to reduce carbon emissions, manage flood risk and enable people to enjoy and connect with nature where they live, work and play."
