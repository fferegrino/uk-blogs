Areas of discussion aligned with the core pillars of social change that DLUHC is looking to deliver through programmes of work such as the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill. This article highlights some of the key takeaways from the event, as we acknowledge the important role that PropTech can play in modernising and reforming the planning system, and improving the productivity of wider housing and planning markets."

When thinking about how to drive more technology into the sector to improve productivity, the group highlighted that the issue is not always about bringing new technology to market, but that instead the current priority may need to be \u2018adoption and diffusion\u2019 of that technology."

For example, with many companies offering digital solutions across the planning process, PropTech firms will be speaking with Local Planning Authorities, planners and architects and will have key insights as to why adoption is still slow in many areas. This \u2018on the ground\u2019 knowledge that PropTech companies hold can help central government to better understand and address the barriers to adoption of new technologies."

Examples of this came from the planning world during attempts to digitise Environmental Impact Assessments, and during the creation of solutions to support first time buyers into home ownership. As one participant explained, \u2018The reality is if we were to do it in a digital format, it wouldn\u2019t gain a professional accreditation. It wouldn\u2019t be received as a proper Environmental Impact Assessment.\u2019 This is just one example of policy persisting from a previous era, but it is a challenge Planning policy colleagues are working to address."

They advised that identifying relevant measurements and data sources needs to be central to policy development and not treated as an add-on. We are working to make sure we take this approach across our priority outcomes, starting with planning data, and that we articulate relevant measurements more clearly both internally and externally. Building on this, others emphasised the importance of strong problem definition combined with understanding the necessary data flows for local authorities to both fulfil reporting requirements and provide critically enabling data for market innovation."

Although data can be a powerful enabler, conversation highlighted that any insights generated will only be able to provide maximum value if there is also resource for enforcement. An example shared in discussion about the private rental sector illustrated where a company has brought relevant data together, but where local authorities have reported they do not have sufficient bandwidth for enforcement to put the results to use. Resourcing to take action will need to be considered alongside data-driven insights in order to achieve the intended legislative outcomes.\u00a0"

This was reiterated by a number of attendees, who voiced that the government can always do more to signpost and raise awareness, not just of particular technologies, but of the PropTech market more generally.\u00a0"

We are actively working to bring policy reforms to fully enable digital approaches in planning, and we will be speaking at events including the Public Sector Proptech Summit next month to raise awareness and champion PropTech capabilities. We intend to take on suggestions such as utilising \u2018on the ground\u2019 knowledge of barriers to adoption and identifying further opportunities to support diffusion of existing solutions across the housing and planning industries. In Faisal\u2019s words, we can \u2018achieve more, faster - with more efficiency - by listening to, collaborating with, and promoting some of the innovations in the private sector.\u2019"
