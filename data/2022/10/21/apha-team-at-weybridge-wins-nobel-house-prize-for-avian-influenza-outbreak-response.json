            "text": "As pressures on the field operation increased, the laboratory also undertook an assessment of sample positivity seen on the different swab types taken during disease investigation. They were able to demonstrate that oropharyngeal (OP) swabbing was most sensitive for the detection at the flock level and as such only OP swabs are now taken in the field for surveillance activities. This has significantly reduced pressures in the field and enabled financial savings."

            "text": "Furthermore, through their knowledge of virus/host interface, they were able to recommend a refinement of blood sampling to exclude sampling chickens and turkeys. This meant that technical staff could take samples on the majority of premises, releasing field vets to take blood from waterfowl species as necessary, bringing time and cost savings across the full spectrum of outbreak response."

            "text": "Finally, the Weybridge team linked rapidly with colleagues at the UK Health Security Agency team in the diagnosis of influenza of avian origin in a human in the UK. This high-profile case led to countless international press releases and global interest. The team imparted its expertise to interrogate zoonotic risk of HPAI. This work, along with other activities, has been submitted to high profile scientific journals and as such demonstrates the value and importance of the APHA team, in their efforts to reduce the one health impact from HPAI."
