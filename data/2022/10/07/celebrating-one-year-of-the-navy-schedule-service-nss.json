Navy Schedule Service (NSS) went live 16th September 2021.\u00a0\u00a0 NSS, a web-based service at SECRET, is used to manage operational planning and tasking of all Navy Force Elements. NSS (known as project SIRIUS) started life as part of the Navy\u2019s Digital Transformation accelerator programme, to transform how digital services are developed and used in the Navy."

It is worth noting that although we have automated the process almost entirely, releases still require humans to be onsite when moving code from OS to SECRET; separate means secure, and that integrity is paramount.\u00a0 As a result, frequency of releases must be balanced between the need for speed to get features into the hands of users and managing the costs to release."
