            "text": "With your feedback, it goes a long way if you consider everything (no matter how small) from timing to delivery, language to how much you give. Be sympathetic, and don\u2019t criticise or condemn. Feedback must be helpful, not overly directive. It shouldn\u2019t contain excessive amounts of information. At best, giving someone an ill-thought-out bit of feedback could interrupt their flow, not be specific enough, or not align well with their values or personality."

        {
            "text": "At worst, it can be clumsy, too tough and sound like heavy criticism. You must take personal responsibility for everything you say, including your non-verbal language. That person is counting on you to support them in receiving a tough message. You need to be sensitive with their emotional wellbeing. Balance the message with positive statements but use words that are neutral and without emotional emphasis."

            "text": "Being a good listener is seriously underrated. I started by saying feedback should always be constructive, so how will you be constructive if you do not let them talk about themselves? They may start on a negative point, but you should let this come out. Resist the urge to influence them too much and confuse their flow."

            "text": "Their negativity will reveal more about their challenges, how they see themselves and how they talk about themselves. Remember, their challenges are there to be overcome. I like to use questions to get them to explore their own thoughts: \u201cWhat do you think is causing this?\u201d \u201cWhat else is this related to? Gentle enquiry is a much more effective way to influence self-observation and positive reflection. Remember that they could shut down, but this is ok. Respect them and stay sensitive."
