They are multi-faceted and long term, requiring cross-cutting analysis with the ability to work across traditional divides and develop innovative approaches. This conference will look at how these problems, such as climate and biodiversity, can be addressed, as well as examining the skills and structures needed to deliver. Designed specifically for early- to mid-career professionals in the civil and wider public service \u2013 as well as in industry and the research community \u2013 this conference will discuss these issues, with panellists drawn from senior leaders and the Future Leaders Programme of the Foundation for Science and Technology."
