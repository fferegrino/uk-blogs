            "text": "I\u2019m obsessed with feedback. I love giving it. I love getting it. I think that\u2019s because it helps you continuously reflect on and challenge things in pursuit of positive outcomes, whether that\u2019s higher quality work or developing yourself."

            "text": "\u2018Feedback\u2019 in a work environment is basically information given to someone that is used as a basis for their improvement. It\u2019s the foundation of their self-awareness. It can range from the general to the specific, but it should always relate to the person. You should only ever offer feedback to benefit someone, or help them learn something beneficial. It must be factual, constructive, and objective."

Every new piece of feedback is a chance to improve. He tells us to think of feedback like \u201cfine-tuning an engine... a recalibration\u201d, and just like what happens with your car, what you put in it can accelerate things."

            "text": "A well-timed piece of feedback can affect huge personal and professional change. On the other hand, a badly timed piece of feedback could seriously derail a person\u2019s development at work and leave a lasting negative effect that stays with them for the rest of their career."

            "text": "Feedback is most often associated with criticism due to how and when people use it. In the workplace, people think praise can be rare and forget that this is an important type of feedback. I want to tell you that praise and criticism are like shampoo and conditioner. You need both."

            "text": "When people get tough feedback, their default response can be to avoid those critics and drop them from their circles or networks. I want to tell you now \u2013 do not do this. There\u2019s lots of evidence that performance suffers when this happens, as well as openness and inclusiveness."

You end up putting pressure on yourself to hold it in and resolve the matter in other ways. A workplace environment without feedback discourages positive risk or even worse, creates a community who fears feedback."

These are feedback panels designed to stir up conflict and enlist tough committees to challenge plans and people. Google have the \u2018X Team\u2019, who rapidly evaluate everything, carry out assessments and rethink proposals."

If you want to see some real change, do small things in your team or function, rather than overwhelm yourself with overzealous organisational ambition."
