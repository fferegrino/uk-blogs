            "text": "Hi, I\u2019m Alice and I\u2019m on a nine week internship with RPA as part of the Fast Stream Summer Diversity Internship Programme (SDIP). The SDIP is targeted at getting university students and graduates from diverse backgrounds into a career in the Civil Service, by providing a \u2018foot in the door\u2019 opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019m currently just over halfway through, after starting in August."

During my time here, I\u2019ve had the chance to complete projects both individually and as part of the team. Most recently an individual project I worked on was the production of a micro-learning video that aims to teach new starters at RPA how to use and complete Civil Service learning. Working alongside the wider team, I\u2019ve supported the planning for focus groups that will gauge our staff\u2019s perspective on delivering Business Excellence performance. In addition, I\u2019ve also been working with the team to support the streamlining of their communications, planning and work organisation and distribution channels."

            "text": "I\u2019ve really enjoyed the opportunity to explore and understand how RPA works. Before I started my internship, I didn\u2019t really understand the work RPA did or how the wider Defra department worked. Through participating and observing in meetings both internal and external with our team, I\u2019ve been able to develop my understanding of RPA and the work that it does. Being given the opportunity to work alongside the Business Excellence Engagement Team has developed my understanding of how the agency works, as I\u2019ve been able to see first-hand the tools that have been developed to support staff in delivering better outcomes for themselves and customers. It\u2019s this wider understanding that I have really enjoyed developing, as it\u2019s provided a sense of understanding to all the work I\u2019ve produced and been involved in."

            "text": "I\u2019ve also enjoyed the variation in the work, as it has meant that no two days are the same. This is because I\u2019m trusted to plan my days in the most appropriate and effective way for my own personal circumstances, as long as I get all my tasks completed."

        {
            "text": "I would say that the aspect of the work I\u2019ve done that I enjoyed most has been the creative aspect. The creativity has come through in several different ways, such as planning how I want to complete a project and designing its final outcome. When I started my internship, I really didn\u2019t expect creativity to be such an integral factor. The team I\u2019ve been working with have also been a factor in why creativity has been so present in the work I\u2019ve completed, as the team really stress the idea of thinking outside the box."

            "text": "I\u2019m particularly proud of the work I did recently producing the micro session on Civil Service learning. This is because I handled the project from the initial planning and research to the production of a final video. This opportunity to work on a project from start to finish resulted in me becoming invested in producing a more positive outcome."

After I complete my internship, I will continue to work in the Civil Service when I move to another department in the new year. The internship has also helped provide me with a clear idea of what I want my future career to look like, as I\u2019m sure I want to be based in the public sector."
