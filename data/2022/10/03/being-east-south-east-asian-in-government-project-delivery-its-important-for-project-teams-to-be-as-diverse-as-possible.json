She is also a co-chair of the Civil Service Race Forum\u2019s East & South East Asian Working Group (CSRF ESEA WG). This group was set up in 2021 due to the rise of anti-Asian hate following Covid and aims to create safe spaces for colleagues to talk about these issues as well as forge a community of ESEA civil servants and allies in government."

My parents wanted me to be a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant. They saw these as the only professions worth considering, maybe because these are often well-paid careers which meant that in one generation, I could lift us out of the low socio-economic bracket we lived within or that it brought them \u201cface\u201d, which is a big concept in Asian culture.\u00a0"

It wasn\u2019t a career my parents were particularly proud of me having and going against their expectations was a pressure I dealt with mentally as filial piety had been rooted in my upbringing. My argument was that I was still doing something in finance albeit tax investigations!"

I wanted a career I enjoyed and was proud of so I seized the opportunity for a new challenge and to apply for a role that was out of my comfort zone but married my love of project delivery and Equality Diversity & Inclusion.\u00a0"
