Beavers are now listed in Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017, making it an offence to deliberately capture, injure, kill or disturb beavers, or damage and destroy their breeding sites or resting places without a wildlife management licence from Natural England.\u00a0This follows Scotland\u2019s decision to make beavers a protected species in 2019."

            "text": "Most negative impacts from beavers occur within 20 metres of the water\u2019s edge and techniques can be employed to help prevent or reduce these impacts. Such measures include making space for beavers through the creation of naturally vegetated buffer zones and the use of low-impact management actions that do not require a licence."

        {
            "text": "One such non-licensable action is the removal of dams less than 2 weeks old. Beavers build dams to retain water and create an aquatic refuge, including raising water levels to submerge burrow and lodge entrances providing them with a secure place to rest and breed. Newly built dams are not treated as protected under the legislation as their removal is unlikely to impact on beaver burrows or lodges."

It is mainly intended to be used by farmers, fisheries interests and other land and water managers to prevent serious damage for example to crops, growing timber and other property. In emergency situations the Natural England enquiry line can be contacted and a temporary licence issued over the phone if justified."

More often than not, no management will be required. However, if it is, it should proceed step-wise, starting with education and awareness raising and \u00a0making space for beavers and, if issues cannot be resolved, progressing to less impactful management actions, such as protecting trees, managing dams or, in some exceptional circumstances relocating beavers."

Due to safety and animal welfare risks, lethal control licences will be subject to strict conditions, and only issued to specifically trained and competent individuals."

It is also important to recognise that removal of a territorial animal, such as a beaver, is only a temporary solution as recolonisation by another beaver is very likely to occur."
