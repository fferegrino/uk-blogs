Caroline explained the reason for the visit and that the Environment Agency will be evaluating all farms in my area, so it wasn\u2019t just me! "

This legislation aims to prevent and limit water pollution on farms, which can arise from the way we handle our livestock or spread our fertilisers for example. Inspectors are visiting farms to make sure farmers are working in a way which isn\u2019t polluting watercourses. Inspectors are there to give advice and tips and work with farmers, and not against like I first feared. "

The inspection letter they send will include a list of all the information they might need, including your general farm records. This is mostly the same as what we do for our annual Red Tractor inspection. Also, the inspectors from the Environment Agency are very helpful. They are there to support you with anything you\u2019re struggling with, listen to your concerns and offer practical advice which will specifically benefit you and your farm. "
