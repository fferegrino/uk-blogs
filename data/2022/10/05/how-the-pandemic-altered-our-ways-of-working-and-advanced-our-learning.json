Back in March 2020, when we were advised to work from home, I can remember saying to a colleague, \u201csee you in a couple of weeks\u201d. Little did we know it would be another 18 months until we were back in the office, and during that time my colleague had retired!"

Even now, at least once a day, I hear the words \u201cyou\u2019re on mute!\u201d Now, we\u2019re using Teams every day to talk to colleagues, hold and attend meetings, host library presentations, record video tutorials and attend learning sessions. Teams has also been instrumental in training, and getting to know, our two new library staff remotely."
