This year\u2019s theme, Time for Change: Action Not Words, focuses on the double-burden black people carry: experiencing racism and discrimination and then being expected to fix the problem themselves. The event encourages people to get involved by taking action using the \u2018see something, say something\u2019 idea of tackling racism.\u00a0\u00a0"

I was hooked on listening, transported to that time and place, immersed in his experience and eagerly anticipating what was to come as he charted the big events in his life that lead to his interest and success in his career. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\u00a0"
