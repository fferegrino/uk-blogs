It no longer takes half an hour to start up a computer and people are not limited by problems with technology."

            "text": "Better internet connections result in better personal connections. By expanding the digital skills of the local population, Blandford has enabled users to get connected at home and in the library.\u00a0 The public wifi attracts people to stay in the library for longer, and supports the use of tablets to catalogue and find books quickly for customers.\u00a0 The library also hosted a talk from a film editor, offering a virtual link to the local nursing home and residential homes for them to join online, which is something they could have never done before."

The project was managed by Dorset Council and the connection supplied by BT Openreach, thanks to the Government's investment. Nationwide, LFFN has provided 2,700 kilometres of lightning-fast full fibre broadband to more than 5,000 public buildings, including schools, hospitals and libraries."

Through one of the fastest rollouts in Europe, two in three UK households had access to gigabit speeds by the end of 2021 \u2013 a huge leap from just one in ten in 2019."
