As a recently diagnosed neurodivergent woman joining in her late 20s, with a university qualification under her belt (in something totally different), it\u2019s been both a unique step back into education and a forward leap into the world of communications \u2013 and the Civil Service."

            "text": "As a recent graduate, I was looking to move into an office-based role in something meaningful, which could help the public in some way. When I saw the apprenticeship opportunity at HMRC, I knew I had to apply for it. It was a good match for me because I felt that my communication skills were already an existing strength, and I enjoy strategic thinking and problem solving. I also have foundation level knowledge of marketing and an interest in some of the core concepts."

            "text": "The 15-month long apprenticeship allows me to develop my communication skills in different areas of the organisation. So far, it has been fantastic. My first rotation was working in the Sustainability team and I loved it. Working on Internal Communications for Social Sustainability (volunteering, charitable giving and fundraising, and tax facts) has allowed me to build my creativity and strategic thinking simultaneously."

I have been leading on internal communications, and recently I have been collaborating with HMRC\u2019s Social Media team to publish content on our social media platforms, which is a new experience for me."

This is something I\u2019m passionate about but have very little experience in writing for sustainability, so I was a little nervous at first. But by challenging myself, it has made my experience very meaningful and vastly contributed to my ongoing learning. It has also quickly improved my writing and planning skills. This learning and improvement were in part due to the high degree of support I experienced from several colleagues."

I am learning about my own strengths and weaknesses, not only as a fresh face in the field and Civil Service, but as an ADHD-er who\u2019s yet to master her own workflow and style. I am continuously learning so many different skills that many neurotypical people likely find natural \u2013 and trying to solidify them at lightning speed."

I find myself losing track of my point, often misusing words due to subconsciously trying to rush through to the end \u2013 to warrant my contribution to begin with \u2013 because I know I want/need to contribute, but just can\u2019t remember what I\u2019m trying to say."

When then adding my slower information processing speed, which impacts my ability to follow lots of dialogue in real-time, this perception of me can easily be amplified."

Using 3-4 whiteboards to visually break down my work, the impact of my work, and the duration of different actions has supported me in working more effectively. I then estimate how long it should take to complete each task and use timers to create a sense of \u2018pressure and accountability\u2019 \u2013 a mindset, which other ADHD people will know, works well."

Most crucially, they have given me a safe space to share my needs and my personality. Underpinning my team\u2019s ongoing support and reassurance is my manager, he has been a great person to go to for insight and direction. We have a friendly but informative relationship and I have learned a lot from him in a short amount of time. It has been a great first experience with a manager."
