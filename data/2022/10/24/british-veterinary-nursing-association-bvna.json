These are also the reasons why I love my job.\u00a0 I began my veterinary nursing journey in 1994, when I was just 18 years old. I was employed as a kennel assistant in a large, East London, first opinion and referral hospital for small animals. I then began\u00a0training as a student veterinary nurse in 1995, before qualifying in 1997."

However, here I am, almost at the end of my Presidential Year and into my fifth year on the BVNA Council."

            "text": "My story is not unique, there are thousands of committed veterinary nurses out there who have the drive, passion and ability to give the best nursing care to their patients and do so on a daily basis. Veterinary nurses are an integral part of the veterinary team, the \u2018backbone\u2019 of the practice. Some veterinary nurses come out of clinical practice and diversify into other roles, such as teaching, practice management, research or as a sales representative, to name a few."

Since then, there have been a lot of positive changes in the veterinary nursing profession.\u00a0 Significant milestones include the introduction of the Code of Professional Conduct in 2012 that, for the first time, required a declaration to be made by the veterinary nurse on their professional registration. All Registered Veterinary Nurses (RVNs) have to abide by the Code and are subject to disciplinary action in the event they fall short of its Principles of Practice and their Professional Responsibilities."

Centred around finding solutions to the challenges faced by the veterinary nursing profession, VN Futures also looks at how to enhance career opportunities for veterinary nurses and maximize their potential."

This means that anyone (regardless of any training or experience) can call themselves a veterinary nurse and this poses a risk to animal welfare and public health, as well as contributing to workforce issues, where veterinary nurses may feel undervalued."
