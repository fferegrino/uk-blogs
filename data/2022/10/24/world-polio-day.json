Working with colleagues at the Universities of Leeds and Oxford, we are also helping develop IPV-like vaccines that do not contain any live virus.\u00a0 These would not pose any risk of causing a resurgence of polio after its eradication and production would not need to be contained.\u00a0"

It led to the early detection of poliovirus transmission occurring in the UK for the first time since 1984 which instigated a rapid public health response, including enhanced surveillance and an inactivated polio vaccine campaign among children aged 1\u20139 years, and formed the basis of this paper in the Lancet journal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
