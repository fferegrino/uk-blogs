A recent away day was a perfect way to prove otherwise and learn more about our training estate, which will be enormously helpful as we develop our public safety campaign.\u00a0\u00a0"

The day started with a briefing about the training areas across the South West \u2013 what facilities they have, what sort of training is done there and so on. To see the maps of the different locations stretching from where we were in Wiltshire all the way down to Cornwall was enlightening as it truly put into context the scale of our role in supporting the training estate. The reveal of staff numbers and size and scope of the work we carry out to support training was truly impressive.\u00a0\u00a0"

The history of the area, the use it has for units in specific training scenarios, and the logistical maintenance carried out by our staff and contractors provided for a very informative and impressive briefing. It revealed aspects of DIO and the training estate\u2019s role that I had previously not considered; what falls within our purview is a myriad of responsibilities. It was a fascinating and exciting experience to see one of our most famous training areas, and the largest in the UK in person. Our tour took us across Salisbury Plain, a beautiful landscape which includes both numerous live and dry training zones. Being taken through it I could immediately see the benefits for the units training there. The flexibility the estate offers in creating scenarios is especially striking.\u00a0"

This is a purpose-built urban training facility, designed to replicate a village so personnel can practise attacking or defending on various levels, from the whole village to a single building. It was great to hear from one of the training safety officers about the upgrades being put in place for the village and the facility\u2019s utility for different training goals. "

Our current campaign, Respect the Range, encourages the public to respect the dangers associated with accessing the training areas with the aim of decreasing near misses and what we call \u2018incursions\u2019 which are members of the public being on the training estate when they shouldn\u2019t be. This could be because the area is closed to enable safe training, or perhaps an area which is permanently off limits, such as artillery impact areas. Incursions can be dangerous, with risks including unexploded ordnance and fast-moving vehicles, as well as disruptive to training.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

I was given real-life examples of near misses and incursions. These incursions are motivated by different reasons, and to have the Salisbury Plain reasons explained to me was extremely useful. I also gained a deeper understanding of who the national and local stakeholders are that we need to engage with if we are to continue the campaign\u2019s impact and encourage safe access. Safety on the ground is a key priority for us here at the DIO and the opportunity to tour one of our training estates only increases my desire for us to play our part in ensuring that these areas are safe for both our service personnel and the local public.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

An away day like this gives me the opportunity to develop my working relationships and bond with my teammates, which in turns makes us all more effective."
