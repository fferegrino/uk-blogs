At HMP Grendon, there are also no split shifts, just 5 days out of 7 and then alternative weekends \u2013 again, unheard of in catering."

Even after nearly 10 years, it\u2019s still a little bit strange walking through the prison unlocking and locking 8 different doors on the way to the main kitchens. As with all catering jobs when you have got changed into your whites, the first priority is to get the kettle on for the morning coffee. Once we\u2019ve dropped off the breakfast to the wings, we start the day\u2019s task of preparing the food for lunchtime and evening meal."

HMP Grendon have mini kitchens on the wings where prisoners take it in turns to have the responsibility of cooking for the rest of the wing. My role is to support them and teach them valuable skills which are vital for when they leave prison \u2013 that's the most rewarding part of the job."

For a prison that has over 350 staff, all the management know your name and you do feel like you\u2019re part of a team. You do feel like you\u2019re making a difference to hopefully help prisoners lead productive lives when they\u2019ve completed their sentence."
