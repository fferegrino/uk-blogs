This helps assessors with the review and can lead to shortened approval times. Whilst there is no need for a copy of IMPD to be submitted if a previous trial is being cross referenced to for this document, a copy of the IB should always be provided as this is required for research ethics committee (REC) review."

For example, sponsors can avoid the need for substantial amendments to extend the shelf life of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) by including a shelf-life extension proposal in the IMPD. This should ideally be done at the time of initial application but can be added as a subsequent amendment to ongoing studies."
