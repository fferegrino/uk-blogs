During that investigation we supported investigators with targeted intelligence work. This included identifying suspects and tracking down one who had fled abroad."

For those working in the waste sector, it makes commercial sense to report it, as legitimate operators are financially undermined by waste criminals. Plus, you have responsibility as an operator to the communities and customers you serve. If nothing else, morally it\u2019s the right thing to do as a citizen."
