We were thrilled to hear that David received the Silver Award, so we caught up with him to ask him a few questions about what it means to be a Stride Mentor and to help understand his views on social mobility and mentoring."

I\u2019m from a lower social economic background but with strong family values of \u201cwork hard and the rewards are there\u201d. I am secondary school educated. I held several positions whilst developing my career path which took me into the corporate banking sector, spanning 33 years, between two high profile banking organisations, having been headhunted from one to the other."

The Stride cohorts are 6-month placements which can be extended with mutual approval of mentor/mentee. My mentees requested an extension to their mentoring time with me. I was happy to do this given how their confidence had grown and coincidentally both had applied for and been successful in gaining promotions."

        {
            "text": "The first thing I always ask people who have doubts over becoming high achievers is this \u201cdo you really want that next job?\u201d If they do, then I always go about getting them to believe in themselves before trying to convince others. Then I always like to review with them their previous two failed applications so we can understand why they didn\u2019t get over the line. Then build on this and start to look at what they could have done differently if they were applying for that same role today. In my opinion, this is how you grow that confidence and belief in a person. Over the years I\u2019ve always remembered the fact that someone once spotted potential in me, and I went on to have a fantastic career. I am truly enjoying my years in the VOA because of that."
