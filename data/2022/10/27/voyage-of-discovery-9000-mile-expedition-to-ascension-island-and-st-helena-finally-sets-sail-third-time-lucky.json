Named after the original Discovery which in 1901 carried Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton on their highly successful voyage to the Antarctic, our modern-day Discovery is fitted with the most up-to-date equipment and perfectly designed for underwater exploration. With our underwater cameras packed and our luggage stowed away, we were ready to roll."

Disappointed, it was back to dry land and back to the drawing board."

Our scientific surveys, which include the mapping of hydrothermal vents and deep-water seabed systems, will gather important data to increase our understanding of how these important ecosystems function. This data will then directly support the Governments of Ascension and St Helena in their work to protect and manage these MPAs."

This vehicle can be deployed on data-collection missions and operated remotely from either land or the ship. If used successfully, we hope that in the future these vehicles can be deployed and used \u00a0in the Overseas Territories to collect new sets of data from the vast network of MPAs."
