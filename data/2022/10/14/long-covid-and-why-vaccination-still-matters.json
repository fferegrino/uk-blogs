A growing number of people are sadly suffering the reality of that statement, each and every day."

Effective support for those affected cannot and should not be limited to the clinical. That\u2019s why I am so glad social care nurses, midwives and the wider care workforce are being recognised, more and more, as essential partners in the delivery of effective care and support."

            "text": "One of the framework\u2019s strengths \u2013 and a particular passion of mine \u2013 is the focus on research and a growing evidence base, both in terms of how Long COVID presents itself, but also the efficacy of the health and care interventions intended to mitigate its symptoms. If we are to lead care teams with authority and credibility, it must be on the basis of methods and processes proven to lead to positive outcomes."

So often, teams or services can get into unconscious mind sets, where there isn\u2019t consideration that an approach tried in one setting, might also be effective in another. Sharing successes helps us all deliver better care for everyone."
