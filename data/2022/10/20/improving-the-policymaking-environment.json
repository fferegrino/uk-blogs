By this, we mean the way policymakers are supported to do their work and all the contextual factors that impact this. We believe that in order to improve policy, we need not only to build the capability and skills of individual policymakers but also to build an infrastructure around them that supports them to do their jobs and deliver better outcomes for citizens."

Having access to a range of diverse data, working with specialists, encouraging openness and creativity, and integrating citizens and stakeholders into policymaking from start to finish were all included as important factors in their ideal environments."

        {
            "text": "These discussions also revealed how the policymaking environment is currently experienced by policymakers in reality day-to-day, exposing both significant issues and opportunities for improvement. For example, policymakers are frequently frustrated by poor organisational memory and knowledge management; report have to overcome major hurdles in order to engage with citizens and end users; and think that operational delivery teams should be more involved in developing policy as well as delivering it. Some of these issues are underpinned by practical barriers, others by complex cultural and/or structural factors that require deeper examination."

There is currently no systematic way for teams or departments to reflect on their policymaking environments, to try to understand the current situation, nor to identify how to make it better in the future."

There was also an acknowledgement that at present when we think about improving policymaking, almost all of the focus is on the individual. In other words, building the skills and capability of policymakers themselves without looking at the contexts within which they are working:"
