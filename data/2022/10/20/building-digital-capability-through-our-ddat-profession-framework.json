The Framework describes the job roles in DDaT and provides details of the skills needed to work at each role level. We\u2019ve created new role clusters and positions and aligned these to the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). SFIA defines the skills and competencies required by professionals who design, develop, implement, manage and protect data and technology."
