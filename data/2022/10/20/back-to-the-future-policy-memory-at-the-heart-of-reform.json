            "text": "\u201cNowhere is this tendency towards reinvention more acute than in the further education sector,\u201d wrote IfG\u2019s Emma Norris. \u201cSince the 1980s there have been 28 major pieces of legislation, 48 secretaries of state with relevant responsibilities, and no organisation has survived longer than a decade. There are now around 13,000 technical qualifications.\u201d"

            "text": "To those acquainted with the history of policy churn in the skills system, this was sadly familiar. The centuries of faltering and cyclical skills reform endure as a stimulus to IfATE\u2019s aspiration: to deliver a stable, coherent and employer-led skills system that enjoys the confidence and understanding of learners and employers."

            "text": "They may have been right, as our acronym was itself set to change from IfA to IfATE within two years as we added other technical education to our brief. Since then, there\u2019s been more legislation, quite a few more secretaries of state, and a range of new qualifications and technical education products introduced. Perhaps to some it looked like business as usual \u2013 more policy churn, more reinvention, more upheaval."

            "text": "In IfATE\u2019s case, reform arose from a number of key reports \u2013 principally the Wolf Review of Technical Education (2011), the Richard Review of Apprenticeships (2012) and Lord Sainsbury\u2019s Report of the Independent Panel on Technical Education (2016). Each was suffused with policy history and articulated recommendations and proposals that drew on deep policy memory and the lessons of the past."

            "text": "But we\u2019re now several years into the reforms. It would be no surprise to anyone if the memory of those reports\u2019 carefully argued conclusions \u2013 about how a future system should be informed by what is known in skills policy history \u2013 was beginning to fade."

            "text": "As with any other maturing reform programme, it may be tempting to announce seductive new initiatives that clash with the logic and evidence underpinning live reforms. Or those that return to well-intentioned initiatives that have been known to fail in the past. Will we perpetuate the cyclical history of skills policy, where a market-led approach with minimal government interventions is replaced by top-down government control, with the pendulum swinging back and forth between the poles over time? These risks are probably greater in an area of policy that is subject to less informed public and media critique than our counterparts working on schools and universities."

Barnaby Lenon\u2019s overview of skills system history in his book \u2018Other People\u2019s Children\u2019 catalogues a helpful summary of \u2018Failure in vocational education\u2019 from 1800 to the near past. All these histories have been unpacked in papers, reports and research over the decades \u2013 including the Edge Foundation\u2019s helpful \u2018Learning from the past\u2019 resources."

            "text": "Other publications, such as the City & Guilds \u2018Sense & Instability\u2019 reports, have sought to foreground key policy history lessons at critical moments. Quite aside from whether all would agree on the conclusions drawn by individuals and organisations from such policy histories, their mere existence has immense potential for policy makers."
        },
        {
            "text": "Yet despite this sizeable body of histories relating to our own field and others, stakeholders, commentators and researchers continue to complain that government doesn\u2019t always learn the lessons of the past in its creation of new policy. Sometimes this is to weaponise policy history in the service of protecting vested interests, of course \u2013 but even then you\u2019d expect those responsible for promoting policy to be prepared for this with a well-informed counter case."
        },
        {
            "text": "That this doesn\u2019t always happen in the Civil Service is partly cultural: a tradition of rapid turnover in policy teams means individuals are not always in post for long enough to build the body of specific policy history knowledge they need. And recruitment tends to privilege the skill of solutions-finding through reinvention. Few civil servants have got jobs by commending the oft-restraining hand of policy memory. We understandably value those we believe will satisfy decision-makers not known for their affection for policy history, especially when it sounds like a technocratic barrier to an ostensibly attractive announcement or sufficiently swift action."

Unceasing policy churn and reinvention have been the enemies of success for too long in skills and technical education. We are taking care to know why."

            "text": "To help with this, we have consciously prioritised the recruitment and retention of domain-expert staff with deep, longstanding expertise in skills history \u2013 including our CEO alongside former education practitioners, regulators and training employers. We are deliberate in paying heed to what they are saying, even when those are inconvenient truths. For others, we\u2019ve developed \u2013 with Gatsby and others \u2013 an \u2018Education Knowledge\u2019 training programme, available to all staff. It unpacks the history of policy successes and heroic failures in our field, ensuring all new staff have a deeper appreciation for the lessons of the past."

            "text": "Our work is driven by direct partnerships with thousands of employers \u2013 those who have experienced first-hand the fallout of earlier policies: we listen just as deliberately to these partners from the \u2018real world\u2019. Their insights are amplified by those addressing IfATE staff in a regular (and very popular) external speaker series at which relevant policy histories make frequent appearances. We\u2019re also improving the critical systems required to maintain better records of our institutional memory, and why decisions were taken: the policy histories of the future will depend on these, and they insure us against mistakes today."
        },
        {
            "text": "No doubt there is space to do even more. For instance, we need new projects to embed evidence from policy history as a routine factor to be considered before policy proposals are devised. I want us, and particularly our senior team, to grow our skill in the sort of storytelling that helps secure the lessons from what has already happened in good policy for the future."

But when these things arise, we\u2019ll keep on track towards the goals that Sainsbury, Wolf and Richard originally set and deliver reform that sticks through strong policy memory."
