This mean that many falsify their age, often without their parents knowing.\u00a0"

I must admit I was guilty of doing this. Although I am not on platforms such as TikTok, up until recently, the privacy settings on my Facebook and Instagram accounts were set to public. Why did I do this? I wanted to share with the world how well travelled I was, and when I had been to events such as festivals, to show I was leading a fun life; all for a bit of an ego boost."

Do I really want my 1,165 Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d (most of which I have only met a handful of times and the majority of who I am no longer in contact with) really knowing that my house is vacant because I am on holiday?\u00a0"

Having quite a unique surname made it particularly easy to find information on me. A quick \u2018Google\u2019 displayed results from swimming galas I competed in years ago, and my Just Giving Page from when I completed the London to Brighton bike ride, shows the names of family and friends who donated. This could be a gold mine of information for any determined hacker.\u00a0"

Listing whether you have Developed Vetting (DV) or Security Check (SC) clearance, on platforms such as LinkedIn, tells people that you are someone who may know or have access to important information. This is something that cyber criminals could exploit and use to their advantage.\u00a0"
