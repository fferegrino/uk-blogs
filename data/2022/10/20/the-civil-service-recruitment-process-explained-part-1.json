This means for each role we advertise, we consider what you will need to demonstrate in your application and interview for us to assess whether you will be successful in the job. This makes the interview process fair and straightforward to prepare for, and gives us the best possible chance of finding the right person for the job, whilst improving diversity and inclusivity."

It assesses candidates against a combination of 5 elements \u2013 behaviours, experience, ability, technical skills and strengths. In the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) directorate, we have a specific DDaT Profession Capability Framework which lists the technical skills needed for each job. In this mini blog series our DDaT recruitment team, recent hiring managers and joiners will explain the DDaT recruitment process and share tips for success at each stage. This blog focuses on the statement of suitability and the Civil Service behaviours, with the second blog in the series focusing on technical assessments and overall success."

We do not always specify a word count, but around 300 words is recommended."

It provides detail and narrative that expands on your CV and sets out how your experiences have prepared you for the role. It is also an opportunity to explain why you want the role and to highlight anything that makes you stand out as a candidate."

For example, you might want to use bullet points to respond to a list of essential or desirable criteria. This kind of format means we can directly compare your statement to our expectations for the role."

The behaviours being assessed for the role you are applying for will be outlined in the job advert \u2013 you will not need to demonstrate all the behaviours for one role. Your behaviours will be marked out of 7 at interview, with 7 being the highest mark. A good way to answer a behaviour-based question is to use an example of a time you have shown the behaviour in a professional situation in your current or previous role and structure your answer using the STAR (situation, task, action, result) method. You can read more about the Civil Service behaviours on GOV.UK."

Using \u201cI\u201d statements and demonstrating ownership of your work is important in a good behaviour answer, especially if you\u2019re describing a team effort. Specific details are also very helpful when explaining the results of your actions, as they give us a fuller sense of the scenario you\u2019re describing."
