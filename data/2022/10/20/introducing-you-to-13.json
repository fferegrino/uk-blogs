I\u2019ve always lived on farms and we currently keep sheep, but for 19 years prior to joining RPA, we ran a dairy herd and milk round, bottling our milk and delivering it around the local villages every day of the year."

I believe my role helps farmers and makes their life easier as I\u2019m able to give them reassurance that we take all their calls seriously and we\u2019ll always look to address their concerns or questions. Being professional, whilst showing empathy and stating from the offset what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s not, managing expectations and being honest is the part of my role that has the greatest impact on those who ring the call centre."

I was also a team leader on a project that set up the poultry registration system where my knowledge of poultry farming came in very useful. I also had the best job in RPA when I was a point of contact between RPA and the farming support agencies. My knowledge and understanding of farmers helped to build trust, and I had the pleasure of working with wonderful people from across all departments to deliver help and support to our most vulnerable customers."

I would encourage everyone to look for opportunities. I try to support others and RPA to the best of my ability, taking on responsibilities as both a first aider and mental health first aider, fire warden, and other roles providing support to colleagues. I\u2019m a mediator, and also support new mediators, as well as undertaking cases for Defra and the Cabinet Office."

I\u2019m the first female and longest serving secretary. \u00a0I\u2019m also a member of the executive committee of the North West Association of Show and Agricultural Organisations (ASAO). I joined the Young Farmers Club in 1963 and am now on the third generation of members. I was also a Governor at the local Lakes College, serving seven terms of office, and I\u2019m currently back as a member of their audit committee and a director of the company responsible for in-house catering and cleaning."

We\u2019ll celebrate 100 years of business next year, and I admit to being the oldest thing there, (even the shop fittings have been replaced three times)."
