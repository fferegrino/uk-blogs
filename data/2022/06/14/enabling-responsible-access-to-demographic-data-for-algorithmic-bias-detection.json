One of the initial workstreams in this programme is exploring the potential for novel approaches to data stewardship to support organisations to access demographic data to monitor their products and services for algorithmic bias. As this workstream takes shape, we welcome your views on its direction of travel."

However, the CDEI\u2019s review into bias in algorithmic decision-making found that the collection of such data is not common practice in most sectors. There are a number of reasons for this, including:"

This could provide a better user experience, and give users greater confidence in how this data is being used.\u00a0"

And what would it take to grow the ecosystem to a scale where it would be of practical use to organisations trying to monitor for bias?"

Proxies are core to how machine learning works, but also carry risks of bias \u2013\u00a0 as machine learning tools are so good at identifying proxies, removing a piece of demographic data from a dataset doesn\u2019t mean that a model can\u2019t be biased.\u00a0"

Proxies can offer an alternative way to monitor systems for bias that do not require direct access to demographic data. To take a simple example, an organisation that knew the names of its customers could make a moderately accurate estimate of their genders, and therefore estimate whether prices (or other outcomes) differed between genders across their entire customer base."
