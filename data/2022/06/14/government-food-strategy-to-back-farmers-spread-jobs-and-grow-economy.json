In light of the consequences of Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine for the global economy, which has caused knock on imports for food supplies as well as spikes in prices, the Strategy also sets out the importance of maintaining and boosting our food security, including plans to strengthen the resilience of our supply chains and increase domestic production to help protect against future economic shocks."

Our Government Food Strategy responds to these findings and recommendations, accepting the majority of recommendations, with policy initiatives to improve health, sustainability, accessibility of diet to secure food supply, while also recognising the shared global challenges of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy."
