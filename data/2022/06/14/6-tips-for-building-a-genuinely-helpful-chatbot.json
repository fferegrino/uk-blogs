This structure is particularly useful when you know that users are often anxious and looking for reassurance that they are doing the right thing or when new rules have been introduced."

This is a significant time saver for both customers and HMRC advisers who are freed up to help those who genuinely need human assistance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
