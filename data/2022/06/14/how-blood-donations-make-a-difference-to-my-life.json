World Blood Donor Day is organised by the World Health Organisation to celebrate and thank all voluntary and unpaid blood donors. The gifts that donors make is truly lifesaving and, in my eyes, makes them all superheroes. And I should know."

            "text": "Blood can\u2019t be stored indefinitely, meaning there is a constant need for donations to ensure there is always a supply for those in need. Despite global need, donation rates differ around the world and some high-income countries see up to seven times more donations than low-income countries."

In a few weeks I\u2019ll be having an operation which will mean I will be a recipient of a couple more pints too."

The transfusions have taken approximately four hours each time, and have seen me receive donated red blood cells, one of the elements that make up our blood along with white blood cells, platelets, and plasma, which supports the carrying of oxygen to cells throughout our bodies."

For my transfusions, I sat in a comfy chair with my book, a needle was inserted into a vein in my left arm, which was then connected to the bag of blood via a tube."

            "text": "The blood ran through the tube and into my arm.\u00a0 My arm was tender for a couple of days and there was a little bruise. But I had no side effects, it was a truly positive experience for me. I like to think the impact of the transfusion was pretty instant.\u00a0 But given I had to have three transfusions in total over a period of 35 days, I think I might be kidding myself."

            "text": "However, knowing the positive affects the donated blood cells would have on me did lift my spirits and helped to lift some of the feelings of fatigue I was experiencing.\u00a0 In the UK around three million transfusions take place annually, I feel incredibly lucky to have been one of this number, but it was only made possible by an equivalent number of donations being made."
