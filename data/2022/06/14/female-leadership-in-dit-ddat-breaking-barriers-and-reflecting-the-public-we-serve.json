Furthermore, 36% of candidates who have accepted offers in technology platforms since January have been female. Three of these were internal candidates, demonstrating our commitment to training and development and providing equal opportunities. Diverse representation is so important to us at DIT. As the Civil Service, we need to truly represent the communities we serve."

I\u2019ve previously written about the powerful message I received when I joined DIT and saw that three-quarters of my line management chain were senior women. But it\u2019s not just about sisterhood at DIT. It\u2019s about the policies and approaches that benefit everyone to work in ways that help them to be the best they can be at work."

So, the challenges are long running as I was at university a very long time ago!"

We\u2019ve had a diverse mix of people moving up on internal promotion as well as brilliant new hires. This translates not just into better outcomes for our people and for building high-performing teams, but also into better outcomes for the citizens and businesses who use our services. I\u2019m grateful to the women and men who have lifted me as they climbed, too!"

I\u2019m so proud of all the expert, passionate women working at all levels in DDaT, but I know there is more work to do. For example, some professions find it much easier than others to recruit diverse candidates. So, we must keep working at it, but this award nomination is welcome recognition for our progress thanks to a marvellous team effort."
