As I was preparing on the day of the race, one of the things that struck me was the sheer number of race participants who arrived on bikes.

According to its Carbon Neutral by 2025 Plan, it has the ambition of becoming the first carbon neutral capital by 2025. Some of the initiatives that have helped support this goal include Copenhagen\u2019s environmentally friendly modes of transport, sensitivity to climate change, sustainable urban redevelopment, and efficient energy use."

Copenhagen\u2019s success is, in many ways, attributed to how accessible and liveable its transport and other projects are for its everyday citizens."

It was a fantastic opportunity to share with leaders across sectors and industries how we\u2019ve built our Defra e-Sustainability Alliance (DeSA) from a few suppliers to now over 300 technology companies and service providers. I was also keen to set out how we\u2019ve driven the embedding of sustainability and green IT commitments into technology strategies right across government."
