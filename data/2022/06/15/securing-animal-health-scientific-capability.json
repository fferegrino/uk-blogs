When the current \u00a0avian influenza (AI) outbreak (the largest the UK has ever experienced) began and developed, it was critical that APHA scientists were able to diagnose the disease and identify the strain of the virus quickly and accurately."

            "text": "During the current outbreak, frontline APHA scientists conducted over 22,000 diagnostic tests on samples from over 120 infected poultry premises as well as testing over 2,000 wild bird samples of which over 1,000 were positive. We were able to reduce the test period for identifying the key strain from 24 to six hours, saving critical time in controlling the disease on farms."

APHA and its partners have demonstrated that a new role for bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) \u2013 a vaccine originally developed for human tuberculosis, has been shown to protect cattle against bovine tuberculosis."

We envisage that once such a test is validated, use of CattleBCG combined with a DIVA test could be approved. You may be interested in reading one of our previous blogs on this topic. Field trials in England and Wales started in 2021 and will significantly contribute to the Government\u2019s aim to secure official bovine tuberculosis free status for England by 2038."

These investigations explore the link between human cases and animal sources. Recently, several potential AMR threats were identified showing resistance to specific antibiotics in bacteria from animals in the UK \u2013 these AMR bacteria could cause disease in animals which is more difficult to treat, an issue that is prevalent in human medicine as well."

Science is progressing to allow us to implement whole genome sequence-based typing of Salmonella for example. This is a great step forward for public health and is facilitating real-time detection of outbreaks, and in the future, it could replace most existing AMR testing with a single process."

Our scientific investigation and advice have helped to manage risks and protect public health. Future developments at APHA\u2019s Weybridge site will enhance our capability and capacity to understand AMR, with advances in facilities helping to further reduce the risks of AMR to animal and public health."
