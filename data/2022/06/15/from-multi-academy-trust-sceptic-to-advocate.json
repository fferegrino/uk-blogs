For 10 years prior to that, I was headteacher at an academy in Halifax and led the school through academisation in my first year of headship. I was fortunate in those early days that my local area had a number of other stand-alone academies and we found support from one another to help me navigate those new days of headship."

So, it might come as a surprise that I had always been a bit wary of MATs. I initially had a perception of a \u2018top-down\u2019 leadership approach."

            "text": "The fear of losing autonomy as a leader was unattractive to me, particularly when our school was doing well. I felt that as head, I was best placed to know my school and community and that my team and I were the best people to address the challenges we faced. How could a MAT replicate that? What if their collective decision wasn\u2019t the best for my school? These were the concerns that drove some of my MAT scepticism."

At that time schools were navigating their way through the pandemic, a perfect storm which meant a whole new set of systems and procedures were needed. As heads, we are used to crisis management, but this was crisis management on an unprecedented scale."

I remember one day physically banging my head on my desk saying, \u2018I just can\u2019t make any more decisions!\u2019 It made it much more difficult to concentrate my time where it should be, supporting teachers and providing high quality remote education to pupils."

        {
            "text": "The value of being in an MAT became abundantly clear to me during the second lockdown. The level of support available to me as a consultant head at a MAT was such a relief. Decisions weren\u2019t taken alone, risk assessments were completed jointly, concerns and issues dealt with swiftly and with compassion. HR documentation was prepared by a central team with expertise, this freed up me and my team to focus on the things we excel at. Meetings with other headteachers allowed us to share our challenges and best practice, with the trust providing continued practical and emotional support."

            "text": "Later that year, I accepted an exec head role within the MAT, which two years ago I would never have considered. However, the support I received and its impact on me and my leadership had been so positive, I was happy to make that leap."

            "text": "The benefits really are plentiful, not just for me, but for my team and most importantly for the pupils. Tailored professional development for staff, opportunities for talent management, trust-led initiatives, support for external reviews, tailored training for leaders, such as PR & media training. Sharing best teaching and learning practice with schools who all share the same values and high expectations puts us in a great position to improve outcomes for pupils and make teachers\u2019 lives easier!"
