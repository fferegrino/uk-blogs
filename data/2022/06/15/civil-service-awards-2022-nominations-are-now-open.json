The LGBT+ Network Mentoring Programme is constructed of 850 people who gave up a small amount of time to help somebody else and that\u2019s the most important thing it recognised. We never expected to get shortlisted, let alone win, so to be recognised this way is great. I\u2019d encourage people to reflect on whether there\u2019s something amazing you\u2019ve done recently. There are enough people that tell the Civil Service it\u2019s bad for all sorts of reasons. But this is an amazing opportunity to show off the things we do get right and do really well.\u201d"

I used the Kickstart programme to support more than 5,500 young people into work by opening six new Jobcentres and recruiting and training more than 1,000 Work Coaches. My only advice is get your nominations in! Don\u2019t worry whether you think it\u2019s strong enough, just put your evidence in and you\u2019ll have a good chance.\u201d"
