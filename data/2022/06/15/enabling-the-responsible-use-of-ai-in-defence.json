Additionally, the MoD has published a policy on the \u2018Ambitious, safe and responsible\u2019 use of AI, which includes a set of ethical principles that we developed in partnership with the MoD to guide how the military and defence sector adopt AI. This blog sets out how we have been working with the MoD to ensure ethical considerations are at the heart of the UK\u2019s use of AI for military purposes.\u00a0"

However, the use of AI presents ethical challenges, many of which are heightened when applied to the high stakes defence context. These include, but are not limited to: the relative unpredictability of AI, responsibility gaps when delegating to autonomous systems, and potential reductions of human control. There is also a concern that AI could enable weapons to operate with no human involvement."

We therefore began by assisting with a widespread consultation of experts in AI, defence and military ethics, engaging with over 100 stakeholders from across the AI ethics and defence landscapes. As part of this, we hosted a series of workshops using a futures methodology. In these sessions, experts from academia, industry and defence co-created potential future scenarios for the use of AI in the military, and explored what the most effective government responses might be."

The panel scrutinises the MoD\u2019s ongoing approach to responsible AI, however it is advisory only, and has no formal decision-making powers. To find out more about the panel, including its membership, see Annex B of the MoD\u2019s paper on ensuring safe and responsible AI.\u00a0"
