This investigation examined both alleged dumping and/or subsidisation of Italian refrigerators. It found that \"export subsidy (\u2026) had caused, and threatened further, material injury to the domestic refrigerator industry in the United Kingdom, and that countervailing action against it would be in the national interest\" but found no evidence that Italian refrigerators had been dumped. Another anti-subsidy investigation considered imports of men\u2019s moccasins and boots originating in Brazil, and resulted in the imposition of a countervailing duty rate of 8% in 1976."

For example, the Department of Trade started an investigation into allegations of the dumping of men's footwear by Poland in 1976 but it had obtained a satisfactory undertaking on the future price levels of men's leather sandals from Poland and did not impose anti-dumping duties. There may have also been cases where UK industry called for trade remedy measures but where the UK never opened an investigation: for example, the case of the Soviet manufactured Christmas cards."
