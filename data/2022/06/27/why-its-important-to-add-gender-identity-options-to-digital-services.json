By tracking diversity data and cross-referencing it with recruitment, retention, learning, development and progression, we can work to make sure that both recruitment processes and career progression are more diverse. It allows us to see how far we have come and how far we have to go."

The data recording options only allowed staff to record their gender as \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019, but didn\u2019t cater to those who identified any other way."
