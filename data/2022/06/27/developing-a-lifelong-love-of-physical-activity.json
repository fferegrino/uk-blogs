We embrace being a physically active school and maximising the physical, mental, social and emotional benefits of regular physical activity. It is always a joy to bump into ex-pupils who want to reminisce about their participation in our PESSPA Programme and tell me about how they are continuing to be physically active.\u00a0"

We speak to children about the relevance, usefulness and enjoyment of the many sport activities offered in our PE curriculum and in our extra-curricular clubs, giving them the opportunity to self-direct their learning and choice of activity. Pupils also value the opportunity to participate in PESSPA leadership groups, particularly our PESSPA Leaders and Girls Active Leaders, which develop our pupils as positive role models who make a significant contribution to our PESSPA Programme across the school.\u00a0"

Certainly, I have found it a very useful course to complete on top of the Level 5 Certificate in Primary School Physical Education and Level 6 Award in Primary School Physical Education Leadership. Plus, I would encourage all schools to join the Youth Sport Trust\u2019s Well Schools movement, focused on using wellbeing to improve school outcomes and academic performance.\u00a0"
