The trains are walk-through for wheelchair users, and have temperature-controlled air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and real-time travel information in each carriage.\u00a0"

Additionally, the Elizabeth line created 55,000 jobs across the UK, recruited over 1,000 apprentices, and trained a new generation of engineers in tunnelling, underground construction, and railway engineering."

This includes the use of 3D and 4D modelling, for example to manage construction fit-out of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. The use of BIM had multiple direct and indirect cost and time benefits, for example the analysis of 3D models with different planning scenarios at Farringdon station enabled \u00a38m of potential costs to be saved."

Three decades later, the word \u2018Crossrail\u2019 evokes a wide spectrum of opinions and emotions, but there\u2019s no doubt that the launch day on Tuesday 24 May 2022 represented an historic moment in UK infrastructure delivery. Further work is now being done to deliver the fully-connected line from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east."
