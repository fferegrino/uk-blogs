            "text": "I currently work within the Basic Payments Scheme (BPS), processing annual BPS applications. BPS is the largest of the available rural grants and payments which provide help to the farming industry. There are a range of processes throughout the year, including checking the eligibility of an applicant\u2019s claim (farmers need more than five hectares of agricultural land and five \u2018entitlements\u2019 to support their land to apply), the transfer of land and entitlements between applicants, processing young and new farmer applications, answering customer queries, processing remote sensing (aerial photography) inspections, payment queries\u2026..the list goes on! Historically, the payment window ran from 1 December to June, although from this year, with many farmers facing rising costs, the BPS payment will be made in two instalments each year with the first payment of 50% from the end of July and the second from December."

Although extremely busy, I really enjoy this role. Coming from a farming background I find it easy to communicate with farmers and agents alike; I love the buzz of being able to offer help and support."

I want to continue to be there for our farmers, helping where I can and making a difference."

I am kept busy with my two teenage children although my eldest has recently passed her driving test which has helped lighten the load."
