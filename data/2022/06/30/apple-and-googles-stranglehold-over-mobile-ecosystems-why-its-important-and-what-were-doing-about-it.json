            "text": "Few people would doubt just how fundamental smartphones are to our lives. They are increasingly the main way we interact with friends and family, access news, play games, buy products and services online \u2013 and now pay for them in shops. Love it or loathe it, our phones have become a key gateway for people and UK businesses alike. Moreover, for some of the poorest households in the country they are the only way to get online and a vital lifeline to essential public resources and services.\u00a0 This makes the fact that the systems upon which these devices rely are almost entirely controlled by just 2 companies \u2013 Apple and Google \u2013 concerning. Apple and Google are the gatekeepers to everything coming through our phones, creating a digital stranglehold that is only getting stronger over time."

            "text": "The powerful position Apple and Google have in these markets, and their impact on competition, has been the subject of our year-long study into mobile ecosystems covering operating systems, browsers and apps on our mobile devices. We concluded that it is extremely difficult for rivals such as other browsers or alternative app stores to compete. Tens of thousands of small businesses reliant on these ecosystems, such as app and web developers, are entirely at the whim of the rules and processes set by these 2 companies. Apple and Google are not only their curators, but in many cases also their direct competitors (with their own news, music, payment and many more services)."

            "text": "We\u2019ve heard directly from many businesses - small and large - who are fed up and frustrated. Concerns include instances where apps have been removed from their app stores with no notice or explanation, leading to loss of services for their customers and vital income; pre-installing apps, or setting defaults that favour them over others; and requiring some apps to use their payments systems but then charging high commissions. We have also heard concerns that they can stifle innovations by restricting developments that pose a risk to their own business models \u2013 Apple\u2019s restrictions over new cloud gaming services is just one example.\u00a0 Furthermore, many of the companies we spoke to were reluctant to be identified publicly, due to concerns of being exposed to retributive action from 2 of the most powerful companies in the world. They cannot walk away as there is no other choice. This affects the UK\u2019s wider digital economy, including tech start-ups struggling to get a foothold; we risk missing out on growth and new opportunities across the UK."

But we looked carefully into this - getting advice from technology and security specialists - and found there are many ways to allow for more competition without compromising safety and security. Many claims made by Apple in particular don\u2019t seem to stack up."

But in this case unless steps are taken now, we think that both companies are likely to maintain, and even strengthen, their grip, and that may be bad for many other businesses. This is why, following the conclusion on our market study, we have announced that we are:"
