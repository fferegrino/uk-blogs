A key update being made now is the addition of a decision-making framework on whether to restock woodlands on peat."

The metric uses environmental data to predict the restorability of peat under forest to help landowners and other decision makers consider the most desirable land use. The metric will be used in beta format for user testing and feedback before release of the full, finalised metric in June 2023."
