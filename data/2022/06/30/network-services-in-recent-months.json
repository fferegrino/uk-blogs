It has also made it easier to identify redundant equipment which has accumulated over the years and enables us to safely remove this in the future. Most importantly it has highlighted other issues in the network rooms, such as power and air conditioning, which when not working correctly causes equipment to fail and take down the network which results in operational work getting delayed whilst the equipment is being fixed."
