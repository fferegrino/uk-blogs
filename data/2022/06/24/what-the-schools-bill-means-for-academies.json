Every academy has a contract with the Department known as a \u2018funding agreement\u2019 \u2013 it outlines a set of requirements which academies must follow in order to carry on receiving Government funding.\u00a0 This means the rules individual academies are bound by are dependent on the terms of their funding agreements at the time they are set up. Because of this, there\u2019s a mixed picture in terms of the rules academies have to follow."
