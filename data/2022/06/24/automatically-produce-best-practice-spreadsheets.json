For example, govcookiecutter can help set up an Agile, analytical project \u2013 check out Eric\u2019s blog to find out more. rgovspeak can help you create govspeak files for publishing."

Finding the time to work together was not always easy, but pair-programming helped us to solve problems more quickly. Running sprints greatly improved our outputs. At the end of each sprint, we discussed progress with experts and users. We also met with analysts to understand their pipelines and needs from the package. This helped us create an easy-to-use product that met the accessibility brief. By speaking to disability network leaders and accessibility experts, we were able to better understand end-user needs.\u00a0"
