            "text": "This still hugely matters, even in these more enlightened times. Many LGBTQ+ people continue to face pervasive discrimination, experience abuse or are subject to neglect throughout their lives. In the 21st Century, let alone the many thousands of years of human civilisation which came before it, no one should feel unable to be open about their identity and what matters to them."

Many of us have experienced disrupted social connections, difficulties communicating with partners, family and others and a consequential increase in anxiety and uncertainty."

Part of that involves re-establishing societal connections \u2013 an adjustment we are all still making, even as life returns to something approaching normal."

This is an important point: awareness, acceptance and celebration of our diverse communities makes everyone happier. Pride Month, in this respect, is a much a celebration of inclusion as it is diversity and difference. It is wonderful to be human."
