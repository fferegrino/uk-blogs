My daily life ordinarily consists of very little risk, and therefore very little personal growth outside of work. It is somewhat out of character then, you might think, for someone who\u2019s never climbed before, never travelled, to be flying more than 11 hours to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro."

I will always be happy to work somewhere, or do something, where I can offer a benefit to the public at large: proud to make a difference."

            "text": "At first, naively, I was rather indifferent to the idea of climbing, seeing it as just another form of exercise. However, the literal sheer scale of this venture soon dawned on me. Standing at 5,895 metres, Kilimanjaro is the African continent\u2019s highest peak - a snow-capped volcano made up of 3 cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. Needless to say, I am now exercising as much as possible in preparation for my climb on 17 August."

Dirty water and poor hygiene spread diseases, meaning even more time is lost to sickness. For a child, this can mean the difference between receiving an education and not; for a parent earning enough to feed their family or not."

Mangary, the oldest and most established trekking route, despite being one of the shortest routes, has the highest rate of failure due to the high stamina and endurance needed to acclimatise speedily."

I\u2019m currently going through Phase One, or basic training, attending \u2018drill nights\u2019 and a number of weekend training sessions, with my fellow recruits. My military gear will certainly come in handy for the majority of my clothing needs on the Kilimanjaro climb: I\u2019ll be taking lots of wet and warm kit to deal with constantly shifting climates as we climb higher."

Looking back at my career so far I\u2019m really pleased that I get to work for organisations like GDS that really make a difference to people\u2019s lives, and continues to support me on my career journey and fundraising work, even though I\u2019ve now moved on - an organisation that, like me, wants to make positive change and supports their people as part of their alumni."

GDS, and the civil service, are full of people like me, people who want to make a difference and empower others, both in their day to day job and in the work they do outside of the office. My climb in August is just one example of the steps I, and many others, take every day to have a positive impact on the world."
