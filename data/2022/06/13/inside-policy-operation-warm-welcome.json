Civilians clinging to the sides of military planes, desperately trying to escape to a safe haven, only to tragically fall to their deaths. Few could forget the chaos in and around Hamid Karzai International Airport as frantic parents passed tiny children over the walls to soldiers, and the ensuing carnage as suicide bombers targeted innocent civilians fleeing."

This was the biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history, and we have continued to bring people to the UK by supporting over 4,000 individuals to leave Afghanistan since the end of Op PITTING."

We\u2019ve deliberately adopted different approaches to gather their views. For example, we hosted focus groups to bring groups of families together to discuss the accommodation matching process. We\u2019ve also held key informant interviews with individual families to gain in-depth understanding about their specific experiences and needs. We surveyed government and council officials to collect views and feedback on the resettlement programme, and shared our\u00a0 insights across government. This helped ministers and policy officials understand the needs and challenges Afghan families continue to face, and shone a light on issues important to their resettlement."

We\u2019ve been able to draw on our personal experiences of Afghanistan to really connect with the families. They speak proudly of their work at the British Embassy or supporting the UK military. And despite the difficult circumstances surrounding their arrival in the UK, it has been deeply rewarding, both personally and professionally, to hear stories documenting both their resilience and success as they adapt to life in Britain."

Rabia\u2019s family of five lived in a one-bedroom flat in Lewisham for a year when they first arrived as refugees in the UK. They recognised this was only a stepping stone in their resettlement journey and wouldn\u2019t be their \u2018forever home\u2019. Daniel spoke about his family\u2019s experience of homelessness in the nineties. The council offered two flats that didn\u2019t meet the needs of his family, but his mother was fortunate to find an alternative and received council support."

This would give them the benefit of being able to search for accommodation in their preferred location that meets their needs. This could also mean they would potentially move into settled accommodation quicker than if they waited for the central process to find them a property."

On a recent hotel visit, we spoke with several families who\u2019d already managed to find properties and were enthusiastically discussing with the council how to make their move a reality.
