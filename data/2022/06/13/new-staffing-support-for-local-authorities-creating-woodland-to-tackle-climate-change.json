A great deal of tree planting has been promised within public net-zero commitments and there is a real urgency to move forward if the full potential of these new trees and woodlands are to be realised by 2050."

A wide range of new woodland creation guidance material has been produced, and increased local support is available from Forestry Commission area teams."

Is there a consultation \u2018bottleneck\u2019 with your historic environment record which is slowing down or even delaying private land applications, for example?"
