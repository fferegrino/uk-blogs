            "text": "The joint article highlights that while no one expects river water to be of drinking standard, there is a serious public health risk resulting from raw sewage from storm overflows being released into our waterways."

            "text": "Protecting and enhancing our nation\u2019s water environment is a priority for this government, which was the first to set out an expectation that water companies must take steps to significantly reduce the harm from storm overflows."

            "text": "Between 2020 and 2025, water companies are investing \u00a37.1 billion to protect and improve the environment. Of this, \u00a33.1 billion is already being invested specifically in storm overflow improvements to 800 overflows. Protected sites and bath areas are the initial priorities."
        },
        {
            "text": "But we will continue to hold all water companies to account and will not hesitate to act if necessary. Since 2015 the Environment Agency has brought 48 prosecutions against water companies, securing fines of over \u00a3137 million. Last year, the Environment Agency and Ofwat launched a major investigation based on evidence that some water companies in England may not be complying with their permits, resulting in excess sewage spills into the environment, even in dry periods. Five water companies have been put on notice to provide documentation for detailed analysis and all companies are under investigation; action will be taken if non-compliance is discovered."

        {
            "text": "The opinion piece also highlighted the impact that wet wipes and other items flushed down toilets, and fats poured down drains, can block sewers and cause avoidable use of storm overflows. Earlier this year the government launched a call for evidence on wet wipes, including new standards for these products to prevent dangerous pollution being flushed down our toilets and ending up in our rivers or littering our beaches. There was a significant response to this call for evidence and we are currently reviewing those responses."
