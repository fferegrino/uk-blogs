Paul McCartney is headlining Glastonbury this weekend, and the Rolling Stones are playing Hyde Park \u2013 60 years after their first gig! These icons continue to thrill us all, and the Glastonbury line-up is full of incredible young British talent. I am determined to uphold that by investing in music education for the next generation."
