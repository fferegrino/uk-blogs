We have adjusted our plans to follow increased demand for particular schemes and actions. For example, we have increased our budget for Countryside Stewardship to reflect the recent price increase for most options and the 40% increase in applications we saw last year, so that everyone who applied could join the scheme. We also increased our budget for the new Farming Equipment and Technology Fund to meet demand 3 times higher than our initial budget allocation, so that more than 4,000 farmers could invest in new equipment and technology for their farm business. We will maintain this flexible approach."

The Farming in Protected Landscapes scheme is funding a range of activities on farms in national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs).
