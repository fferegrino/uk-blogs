            "text": "For the first time, this could allow scientists to acquire continuous, real-time environmental data from the bottom of seas and oceans. This has the potential to expand the global earthquake monitoring infrastructure from land (current seismometer-based networks) to the seafloor (cable-based approach). In future, it could potentially be used for early-tsunami detection and help save lives globally by giving governments extra time to warn coastal communities."

            "text": "New NPL-led research has been published in Science and shows how seafloor cables can be converted into an array of sensors rather than just a single sensor.\u00a0NPL and its partners (Google, University of Edinburgh, British Geological Society, Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica) tested this technique on a 5,860km-long subsea optical-fibre cable between the UK and Canada. To transmit data traffic over these great distances, the cable incorporates optical repeaters (an electronic device that receives and amplifies signals over long distances) every 46 km."

            "text": "During the tests, the team successfully measured the environmental perturbations (i.e. a deviation of something from its normal state due to an outside influence) over 12 individual cable spans between repeaters, detecting distant earthquakes and local ocean currents. By transforming the cable into an array of sensors, the team was also able to identify the source location of earthquakes. NPL plans to increase the number of sensors in future tests, potentially up to 129."

Only a handful of permanent ocean-floor sensors exist, as installation and maintenance is expensive and technologically challenging. This leaves a huge gap in geophysical data and limits our understanding of the Earth\u2019s structure and dynamic behaviour."

If this technique were to be applied more broadly across the globe\u2019s cable systems, huge areas of the ocean floor could be monitored that aren\u2019t today. This would provide more data for scientists and potentially detect tsunamis earlier than with other existing methods, helping to save more lives globally."

More broadly, it provides for the first time an affordable and scalable solution for monitoring the seafloor globally, as no changes to the underwater infrastructure are required."
