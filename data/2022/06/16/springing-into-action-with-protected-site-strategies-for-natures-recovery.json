It has given us some of the tools needed to deliver for our environment, from cleaning up the country\u2019s air, restoring natural habitats, increasing biodiversity, reducing waste, and making better use of our resources."

            "text": "Protected Site Strategies will support the delivery of other Environment Act policies, including Local Nature Recovery Strategies, along with the Nature Recovery Network. They will also provide opportunities for Green Finance and Biodiversity Net Gain. Local Nature Recovery Strategies will provide consistent spatial plans for nature across England which Protected Site Strategies can help realise with packages of measures designed to address challenges faced by particular protected sites."

        {
            "text": "Coastal squeeze (intertidal habitat loss), nutrient, air, and water pollution, climate change impacts and overgrazing are just some of the pressures a Protected Site Strategy could make a difference to. They will be most valuable where there are complex off-site issues affecting site condition and where the solution involves different operators. Key to success will be putting together successful partnerships to help deliver improvements. Currently most of our policies are focused on minimising harm to protected sites. Protected Site Strategies will be more ambitious, addressing impacts in ways that build nature\u2019s recovery beyond its current state."

We will also be testing whether Protected Site Strategies have the potential to win business confidence to invest in nature-based solutions and new technologies that will address the root causes of impacts. For example, could a common vision to address nutrient impacts in a river catchment brought together in a Protected Site Strategy be the catalyst for investment in resurgent native woodland enterprises that follow from increased new woodland creation to reduce nutrients?"
