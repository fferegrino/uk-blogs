        {
            "text": "Whilst the environmental ambitions and outcomes are aligned, Mid Tier is a scheme for the majority of farmers and land managers to help them protect and enhance the environment. Higher Tier involves more complex environmental management schemes which offer significant benefits to high-priority areas."
        },
        {
            "text": "CS schemes such as Mid Tier and Higher Tier help to support the preservation of the countryside for future generations. By applying to create new habitats, for example, you will be helping enhance the natural environment through supporting biodiversity. This is all part of supporting Defra\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan \u2018for our country to be the healthiest, most beautiful place in the world to live, work and bring up a family\u2019."

Applying online is easy and you can also track the status of your claims through the Rural Payments service. Our blog in February provides further information.

Applications for capital grants also opened on 8 February 2022 and, while there is no closing date at the moment, we do recommend applying early as we may need to close the scheme for this year depending on the volume of applications we receive."

            "text": "We hope the changes we\u2019ve made to the application process will mean a quicker and more straightforward approach for farmers and land managers. However, we appreciate that participating in an agri-environment scheme is a significant commitment. The purpose of asking for evidence may vary depending on the scheme, but the overarching reason is to ensure public money is spent appropriately. We continue to work on making the evidence submission process as streamlined as possible."

            "text": "Farmers and land managers who are participating in CS can also consider schemes like the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) scheme. The SFI scheme will be open to farmers who are eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme and who already have an agreement under an existing agri-environment scheme - such as CS and Environmental Stewardship \u2013 provided the SFI standard they choose is compatible with their existing agreement and doesn\u2019t result in them being paid twice for similar activities. For further information, please read the Sustainable Farming Incentive guidance on GOV.UK."

            "text": "As part of the Agricultural Transition Plan, Defra are also launching two other new schemes: Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery. Local Nature Recovery will be a successor to CS - so that farmers can choose the right combination for their setting and preferences. Defra will publish more details on the full list of options later this year, alongside more details on scheme rules and proposed payment rates. But CS is a solid option for now and farmers really should regard the scheme as a bridge to Local Nature Recovery."
