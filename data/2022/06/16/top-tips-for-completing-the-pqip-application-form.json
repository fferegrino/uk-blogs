Along with providing your personal information and details of your education and career, you will need to complete four behaviour-based questions and one experience question. Behaviour-based questions are looking for the actions and activities that people do which result in effective job performance."

Whilst your answers ultimately depend on your behaviours and experience, the below \u2018top tips\u2019 offer advice and simple techniques to help improve you answers."
