            "text": "There are a variety of ways this is accomplished: monitoring the current health and predicting the future health of the live service is only a small part of this. We also build the tooling and pipelines that help developers improve the service rapidly and safely, providing safety nets so that both the developers\u2019 confidence in making changes is improved, and the changes that are made are safer to deploy."

I tend to start earlier than most people so I have a quiet period leading up to the daily stand-up meeting. This means typically I will work on current project work from around 8am to 9.50am, when we have our team stand-up."

            "text": "When approaching projects we often do a few exploratory pieces of work (known as spikes) early on to get a good understanding of where the difficulties may lie, to try and reveal any unknowns, and to test our designs before doing a fully robust and well-tested production build. This lets us iterate quickly towards our current goal and get a clearer view of which parts of the project might be more challenging."

        {
            "text": "At GDS we work in an agile manner, within most teams part of this is having a daily stand-up meeting. So at 9.50am our team has a stand-up where we have a very quick look to see if anything needs signing off, requires reviews, or is totally blocked. The stand-up continues and we each mention what we did the previous day and what we are planning to do on the current day, this also gives us a chance to ask for help or reveal any potential problems we have found."

            "text": "There\u2019s also plenty of opportunity to present new ideas, or questions you might have to GDS\u2019 communities which could need a wider discussion. These meetings often happen in the afternoons and give you a good chance to connect with your peers."

This space affords me the opportunity to grow as a professional and to deliver the best possible solution for the public which is accessible, robust, and delivers value."
