JIC\u2019s research aims to address global challenges and use knowledge of plants and microbes to answer fundamental questions. Its research can have a significant impact on industrial biotechnology, society, and global development. "

            "text": "After treatment with UVB light to turn the 7-DHC into vitamin D3, one biofortified tomato contained levels of vitamin D equivalent to two medium-sized eggs or 28g of tuna. There is scope to further increase these levels through extended exposure to UVB light. Additionally, when tomatoes are grown, their leaves are usually considered waste material. However, the leaves of these biofortified tomatoes could be manufactured for vegan-friendly vitamin D3 supplements, or for food fortification. This has the potential to be a simple and sustainable innovation in helping millions of people with vitamin D deficiencies."
