The UK\u2019s efforts to stop the trade in ivory includes the risk of a \u00a3250,000 fine or up to six months imprisonment for those who break the law.\nThat\u2019s why getting the right tools in place was vital. The Act bans the dealing in elephant ivory except for five narrow and carefully defined exemptions."
