The public sector algorithmic transparency standard is one of the world\u2019s first initiatives of its kind. It provides a framework for public sector organisations to share information on their use of algorithmic tools with the general public and other interested stakeholders.\u00a0"

We published the first version of the standard in November 2021. For more information on how and why we developed the standard, see our previous blog."

The roundtables were facilitated by techUK and the Crown Commercial Service respectively and were attended by nearly 100 representatives from the private sector."
