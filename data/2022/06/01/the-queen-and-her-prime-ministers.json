Festivities will be held across the country to mark the Queen\u2019s incredible 70 years on the throne.

She smilingly reminded me of this at an audience 6 years later\"\u2019[1] Macmillan found that \"the Queen was a great support, because she is the one person you can talk to.\"[2] Similarly Edward Heath found his weekly audience with the Queen to be an occasion that he \"looked forward to \u2026 It was always a relief to be able to discuss everything with someone, knowing full well that there was not the slightest danger of any information leaking. I could confide in Her Majesty absolutely.\"[3]"

On that watershed evening, the day before he resigned, the great wartime leader toasted Her Majesty and recalled that he had relished drinking to the same toast as a cavalry subaltern \"in the reign of Your Majesty\u2019s great-great-grandmother\", Queen Victoria.[4] Churchill\u2019s Private Secretary, John Colville recalled the dinner of fifty or so Cabinet ministers, grandees and officials: \"It was a splendid occasion. \u2026 Lady Churchill took special pains about the food and 10 Downing Street can seldom if ever have looked so gay or its floorboards have groaned under such a weight of jewels and decorations.\"[5]"

Wilson said, \"I have great respect for tradition. \u2026 I like the real ceremonies of the Monarchy.\"[6] He would often remark that a prime minister had to do their homework ahead of an audience with the Queen, or she was likely to catch them out.[7] Wilson and the Queen got on very well, their audiences became lengthier with one reportedly lasting 2 hours.[8] In the mid-1970s Wilson returned as Prime Minister for 2 years. Upon tendering his resignation in 1976, he chose to invite Her Majesty to No.10 for a farewell dinner. This took place 21 years on from the Queen\u2019s last visit to No.10, when Churchill had marked his own departure with a royal banquet."

Walpole is regarded as the first British Prime Minister.[15] Thatcher took great delight in being able to mark the occasion with a grand dinner in the State Dining Room, to which the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were invited as well as former prime ministers Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and James Callaghan. Her Majesty gave a speech in which she remarked that by that point in her father King George VI\u2019s tenure, he had visited No.10 more frequently. In jest she said, \"I was beginning to wonder what I\u2019d done wrong!\"[16]"

That was before you were born.\"[17] The Golden Jubilee dinner at Downing Street was attended by former prime ministers Edward Heath, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. It was an enjoyable occasion for all. The Queen noted, \"Isn\u2019t it wonderful not to have to be introduced to anyone?\"[18] Her Majesty received a silver gilt plate from her Cabinet ministers, which was engraved with their signatures.[19]"
