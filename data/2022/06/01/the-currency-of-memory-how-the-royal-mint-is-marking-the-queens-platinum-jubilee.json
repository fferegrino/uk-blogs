This generation, for whom the Queen\u2019s presence has been an enduring comfort, celebrated with her the Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees and have a wealth of treasured memories from each of them.

Notably, in February 1971 Britain adopted a decimal currency. This was a momentous event for the whole country, with every man, woman and child having to change the way they used money. Handling and chatting about pre-decimal coins can stimulate happy memories for those who lived through the changeover, and it was from this idea that the Royal Mint Museum developed reminiscence sessions."

This collection is focused on Her Majesty The Queen's Platinum Jubilee and her previous Jubilee celebrations, including pre-decimal coins, commemorative items, images and newspaper clippings which explore a separate event or memory. The box is fitted with a sensor and speaker and each object is fitted with a special micro-chip which, when placed on the box, play audio clip specific to that object to explain it and tell a story. This can be a fun and stimulating activity, giving people who lived through the changeover an opportunity to talk about their memories throughout their lives."
