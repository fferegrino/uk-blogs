            "text": "These talks were in aid of raising awareness of the measures in Studland Bay which came into effect in December 2021. The team were also keen to gain insight before the interim voluntary no anchor zone is replaced by Phase 2 - a larger area protecting the majority of the seagrass beds in the MCZ - from 1 June 2022."

            "text": "MMO is responsible for assessing and managing impacts of marine non-licensable activities in the 157 marine protected areas (MPA) between 0 and 12 nautical miles (nm) from the coast in English waters. There is a huge variety of activities here, from jet-skiing, recreational anchoring to snorkelling. Where these activities are not compatible with the conservation objectives of an MPA, MMO is responsible for implementing management measures to protect the relevant habitats and species."
        },
        {
            "text": "Studland Bay has historically received a high level of stakeholder interest, owing to the popularity of the site amongst the boating community, and the sensitivity and importance of the habitats and species present there. Studland Bay was designated as a Marine Conservation Zone by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in May 2019 in recognition of the importance of the species and habitats present to the marine protected area network. Due to the risks from recreational activities to the designated features of the MCZ, including seagrass beds and long-snouted seahorses (also known as spiny seahorses) MMO assessed for the need for management in 2020."

        {
            "text": "Some stakeholders for Studland Bay have requested that we delay the extended voluntary no anchor zone. We have listened carefully to these requests and the reasons given, for example the lack of moorings to provide an alternative to anchoring within the voluntary no anchor zone. After careful consideration of a range of options, we have decided to proceed with the introduction of Phase 2 of the voluntary no anchor zone."
        },
        {
            "text": "While we understand the desire for boaters to continue anchoring over the seagrass beds until additional moorings are available, this would not allow us to meet our legal duties to ensure the seagrass beds are protected from damage. While we recognise how much visiting Studland Bay means to many boaters, and the disruption that the no anchor zone may cause, it is also really important that we stop the damage to the seagrass beds from anchoring. We hope that people will continue to enjoy Studland Bay and will adhere to the voluntary no anchor zone when doing so. People will still be able to sail over the seagrass beds, and to anchor in other parts of the Bay."

        {
            "text": "We held a call for evidence and formal engagement period in 2020 and 2021 to gather feedback and identify the most appropriate management approach. We have since held further engagement events (April 2022) in the area including pop-up stands and meetings."
        },
        {
            "text": "As a direct result of stakeholder feedback, the no anchor zone has been introduced as a voluntary measure, rather than a statutory measure such as an MMO byelaw. We also introduced this in a phased approach, rather than all at once, in order to allow to give time for boaters to understand and adapt to the no anchor zone."
        },
        {
            "text": "We understand that some boaters may feel frustrated that we are introducing the larger voluntary no anchor zone, despite the requests to delay Phase 2. We have listened, and carefully considered these requests. Despite this, for the reasons outlined above, we have decided to continue with Phase 2 of the voluntary no anchor zone. . We are always keen to hear from stakeholders and understand their views, so if you want to ensure your voice is heard, please get in touch via email:\u00a0 info@marinemanagement.org.uk or by telephone: 0300 123 1032."

            "text": "Seagrass beds are some of our most important coastal habitats. They provide an important habitat for many species, for example seahorses and cuttlefish. In particular, they act as a nursery for many commercially important fish and shellfish species. They are one of the most effective habitats at capturing and storing carbon dioxide, helping in our fight against climate change."

        {
            "text": "The good news is that seagrass beds in Studland Bay, and around our coasts more generally, have generally been expanding since that point. Despite this, there are a range of threats to seagrass beds. This includes physical impacts from human activities, including certain types of fishing, and anchoring."
        },
        {
            "text": "Even in an expanding seagrass bed, physical impacts such as uprooting and breaking up of seagrass rhizomes, reduce the ability of seagrass to support a healthy ecosystem, and can even create barren patches."
        },
        {
            "text": "There have been some claims that anchoring can benefit seagrass by, for example, creating loose clumps of seagrass which can then establish new areas of seagrass. Unfortunately, there is no evidence for this. In fact, there is a large and increasing body of evidence which consistently shows that anchoring is harmful to the health of seagrass beds. A summary of this evidence is available in the MMO Studland Bay MCZ Habitat Protection Strategy."

We recognise that marker buoys and additional moorings would make it easier for boaters to adhere to the voluntary no anchor zone and are currently looking into what we can do on both of these points."
