If drinking was a factor in an offender\u2019s crime, AAMRs ban them from drinking alcohol for up to 120 days. They must also wear an alcohol monitoring tag as part of their community sentence."

It also provides greater opportunities for more informed conversations and collaboration across the agencies dealing with the offender."

            "text": "The tag takes a sample of the wearer\u2019s sweat every 30 minutes. It provides a continuous record of whether the offender has been drinking. If the tag detects alcohol or is tampered with, an alert is sent to the Probation Service."

        {
            "text": "The high compliance rates mean lower numbers of offenders breaching their sentencing requirements and being sent back to court. This gives courts more time to deal with other cases and priorities."
