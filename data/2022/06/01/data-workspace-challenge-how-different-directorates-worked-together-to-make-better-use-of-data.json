We were able to produce a prototype for something that our Trade professionals and leadership have been seeking for a long time. We\u2019re excited to show the potential for any region to see their export pipeline integrated with their wins and targets. This provides evidence-based forecasting for the very first time and will, we believe, lead to an increase in UK trade.\u2019\u00a0"
