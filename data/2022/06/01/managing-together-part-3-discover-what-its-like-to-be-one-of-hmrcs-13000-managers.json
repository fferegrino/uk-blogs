I began working at HMRC in June 2021 as a team leader for Customer Compliance within Debt Management. We deal with complex queries and debt matters brought through our private debt agency partners."

I have found that I can support and develop my team better as I understand my own strengths and can value the great team I have with all their unique skills and characters."

            "text": "A key challenge is completing the work on time to meet tight deadlines. As a team leader, I support and develop my team and ensure their welfare so they can meet these deadlines, while I balance the workload to make sure it is manageable. I keep in mind that a lot can be going on in a person's life other than their work, so I support them by getting to know them and their circumstances first. I know what they are capable of and by listening and trusting each of the team to do various pieces of work, I have been able to share opportunities out better. I develop my team by building on their strengths and re-thinking how we do things as a team, which has created a productive environment."

            "text": "Developing my own manager skills, such as Emotional Intelligence, has proved very beneficial to my own self-awareness. This has proved helpful when talking to individuals about their own development and supporting them to meet the tight deadlines. I have developed the team by being empathic, listening to their issues but not necessarily offering solutions, encouraging individuals to try to work problems through for themselves."

            "text": "I am proud to work for HMRC as the department has a strong commitment to making their workforce accepting of difference and neurodiversity and an understanding of the positive gains that can be achieved through having a neuro-diverse workforce. As a new manager, I know I have a long way to go and lots to learn but am looking forward to the challenges ahead and continuing to support and develop my team so watch this space!"
