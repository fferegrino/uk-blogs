The team disposes of those files which are no longer needed, and they also arrange for a small number of files, which are deemed necessary to be kept for business or sensitivity reasons, to be further stored."

A decision is then taken on whether they should be selected for TNA (round 3% are), destroyed immediately or destroyed at a date in the future. We try to liaise with the original owners of the files over the decisions we make and engage them in discussion. Some files do have a longer retention, 50 years plus in some cases usually due to sensitivity (a few wartime files remain.) The oldest file I\u2019ve seen related to land and property deeds. It was written on vellum and dated back to around 1650."
