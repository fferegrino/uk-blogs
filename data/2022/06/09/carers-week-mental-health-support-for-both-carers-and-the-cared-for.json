When I look back with hindsight, he might not have been quite himself, but as he chatted to me, it was only when he began to cry and say \u2018I can\u2019t lose you\u2019 that I started to wonder if he could be depressed."

            "text": "About a year ago he had a similar experience, he rang the doctor as he hadn\u2019t felt quite right, and the doctor told him to go online and look at mental health websites for advice. It was likely that he was experiencing depression then, but the dismissive attitude from the doctor made him want to hide his real feelings, and so to me he always seemed pretty jolly and happy."

I saw him talking to someone, before returning to me, looking distraught."

My eldest son from a previous relationship and our youngest son were sent to their grandparents while my fianc\u00e9 also struggled with panic attacks and paranoia."

I asked my fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend if he could stay to help me with appointments and prevent my fianc\u00e9 from trying to get out of the car while I was driving, or bolt over the six-foot fence in the garden."

He\u2019d been at his work for 14 years but didn\u2019t particularly enjoy it. Although it was hard, he left work. My work was understanding, and I was able to work flexibly to support him. When I returned to work, he occasionally came in to see me, but I also tracked him using my phone as I was still worried about him, especially as there was a river nearby where we lived."

            "text": "I describe that time as like \u2018having another child\u2019. Things have improved though. He\u2019s now a self-employed landscape gardener and loves it. He gets himself up and out to work.\u00a0 He\u2019s still under the care of the Early Intervention Team and has ups and downs as you\u2019d expect. The main thing is that he seems happy in himself. I can see our youngest son is like his dad \u2013 he puts pressure on himself when he really doesn\u2019t need to, but sometimes when things like this happen you can realise that you need to change.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a time where you find out who your friends are, and that by opening up to people, you can get a lot back in return."

I finally recognised that, like him, I had to talk to someone too. I love and admire him more now for what he\u2019s been through and we\u2019re stronger as a couple. I can\u2019t wait until we get married in two weeks!"
