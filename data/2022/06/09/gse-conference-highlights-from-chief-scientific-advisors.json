This was a really great event which showcased the breadth and depth of science and engineering expertise we have across government. To round of the event, we asked Chief Scientific Advisors and senior civil servants who attended to provide their highlight from the conference. Here\u2019s what they had to say:"

I loved hearing about such a range of science that spanned across different disciplines and that is done so well by people who were really experts. It was also incredibly useful to make so many new contacts. Some of the people I met had deep scientific expertise or worked in policy areas where science has an important impact. It really demonstrated to me the wealth of expertise we have across the civil service - we are sitting on a goldmine of talent and people who are doing really interesting things.\"\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "But the main highlight for me was the Diversity and Inclusion aspect, which was a thread running throughout the conference. We heard from Patrick during his keynote address just how important it is to be a diverse and inclusive profession: the wider the range of backgrounds, characteristics and lived experiences, the less likely we are to succumb to group-think and the more likely we are to be innovative and achieve great outcomes in our work. This was reinforced during the Diversity and Inclusion session, where members of the GSE Diversity and Inclusion Action Group shared their thoughts on some of the challenges, discussed best practice and highlighted some of the progress that\u2019s been made. My main takeaway from this session was the importance of leaders being visible and open about our real selves \u2013 for me, that means remembering more than ever to be clear about being a proud British Bangladeshi, a muslim, and someone who deals with imposter syndrome.\u201d "

            "text": "Luckily, I was able to attend most of the GSE conference and was invited to be a part of the closing session providing some of my remarks from the day, this also included presenting the winner of the engineering poster. It is incredibly hard to pick out a highlight from the day as there were so many interesting and wide ranging sessions. If I was to narrow it down to two it would be the Turbo Talks from the morning session, which gave the opportunity for various individuals from across Government to present on their previously submitted S&E posters; Unfortunately I was unable to attend this session, but heard extremely positive reviews from the wide range of DfT colleagues that attended the conference. Furthermore, I was delighted to hear that Michaela Nelson from our very own team was one of these talks, spotlighting the DfT Futures Uncertainty Portal. The other was the strong emphasis throughout many of the session on Diversity and Inclusion and the importance of this within the Science and Engineering profession. It is great to see this at the forefront of our thinking and the great discussion both within the sessions and in the coffee/lunch breaks. "

The posters also showed how new knowledge is being generated and applied, directly and indirectly through Futures thinking, to influence and guide policy development in the years ahead. The conference highlighted to me the importance of working together, both in the science we undertake and also in sharing that knowledge across normal boundaries.\u201d"

We have been working together for more than a year to highlight the great work underway, role modelling blogs, peer to peer mentoring and more, including why diversity and inclusion are essential to bring the maximum to GSE from across the community that we serve. It was great to meet face to face for the first time, meet new members and have a session committed to embedding diversity and inclusion at the heart of everything we do. There is still work to do across GSE and we are always keen to welcome anyone interested in helping. We had so many questions from the audience we ran out of time. It would be lovely to meet more GSE members and learn from others what is working locally and how we can share good practice.

It offered an excellent opportunity to connect with old and new colleagues, and to pay tribute to the strength of our science and engineering work. There was a real energy and buzz about the day, and it was inspiring to learn about the diversity and vitality of the work that GSE colleagues are involved in: from land use in Defra, to the science and technology behind kitting out and maintaining a submarine.

Climate change is already impacting our cities and their residents, through heat and flooding, with associated actions to reduce climate change also improving air quality and the health or residents. The highest risks are felt in areas where the majority of the population are from an ethnic minority. The UK has one of the largest rates of public concern around climate change, but this concern has not been translated into large-scale action. The emphasis on devolved ownership of solutions to the local communities came across strongly in the discussion, with examples of where this has worked well. Policies need to actively support those working at the community level, rather than introducing extra process. Understanding the social context of the challenge, and how to communicate effectively with the community, is important right from the start of any intervention. People are an inherent part of our net zero journey and scientific co-development to generate behaviour change and initiate action is every much a part of the solution as policy changes.\u201c"
