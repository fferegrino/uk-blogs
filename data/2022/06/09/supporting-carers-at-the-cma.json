            "text": "The charity Carers UK estimates that around 1 in 7 people in the workplace have caring responsibilities. Research has shown that, if unsupported, caring whilst working can result in poorer mental health, higher risk of burnout and financial worries. Those with heavy caring responsibilities are 2 to 3 times more likely to be in poor health and over 70% of working carers have felt isolated in the workplace due to caring responsibilities."

            "text": "Balancing caring responsibilities with work presents a particular challenge. One of the hardest acts in the workplace can be for carers to open up to colleagues about their personal circumstances; and for managers and colleagues to have the confidence to have open, empathetic and honest conversations with their caring staff. Employers have a key role in fostering a culture in which such conversations can take place."
