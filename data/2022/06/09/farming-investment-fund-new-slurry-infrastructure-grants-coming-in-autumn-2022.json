            "text": "Every year, farms in England generate and use millions of tonnes of livestock slurry. Slurry contains lots of nutrients and material that can benefit soil health and support crop growth. It can, though, create significant pollution to our environment. Though some farmers have plans, equipment and infrastructure in place to manage the nutrients in their slurry and manure well, others face significant financial barriers to having sufficient slurry storage. This is an area that has not been effectively regulated in the past. As part of the agricultural transition, we want this to change."
        },
        {
            "text": "We\u2019ve designed the new grant alongside a number of other measures to help livestock farmers make use of their manure and organic nutrients, backed up by better advice and fair, effective regulation of the rules over the agricultural transition period. We are increasing the scope of the Catchment Sensitive Farming service so that it is available across England. We are reviewing all the guidance on GOV.UK so it is as clear as possible. We are also looking into the potential of more nutrient sharing between farms."

        {
            "text": "Farmers are obliged to have a minimum of 4 months slurry storage in the rules for Storing silage, slurry and agricultural fuel oil; 6 months storage will help farmers go beyond those requirements, meet the Farming rules for water and spread slurries to meet crop needs, rather than wasting them because of a lack of storage."

            "text": "You must use the grant to reach at least 6 months storage capacity based on your current herd, and the stores must meet regulatory and build standards. You can go beyond 6 months storage capacity but we will cap the grant contribution at 6 months so that we can afford to support more farms to improve their storage to at least that level. You\u2019ll need to maintain 6 months storage capacity on your farm as a condition of the grant funding agreement \u2013 meaning you\u2019ll need to take appropriate action if you change your herd size in the future. "
        },
        {
            "text": "All grant funded stores must also be fitted with an impermeable cover. This is an important step to prevent rainfall entering stores and to reduce air pollution. You don\u2019t need to do this if your farm already uses a slurry acidification system that reduces the pH to 6 or below at the point of storage.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Stores that remain part of your compliant storage capacity don\u2019t need to be covered as a condition of the grant. You cannot use the grant to retrofit a cover onto an existing store without also expanding the store in the first round, but you can apply for covers for existing stores under Countryside Stewardship."

        {
            "text": "Recognising the significant cost of investing in high standard slurry infrastructure, the grant will cover 50% of eligible costs. We\u2019ve also changed the minimum and maximum grant amounts from previous rounds of the Farming Investment Fund: lowering the minimum grant to \u00a325k to help smaller farms and capping the maximum at \u00a3250k so we can fund more projects.
