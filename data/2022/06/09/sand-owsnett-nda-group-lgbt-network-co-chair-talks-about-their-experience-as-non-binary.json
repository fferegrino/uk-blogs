            "text": "It was in October 2016 when I realised that I was non-binary. After being around trans and non-binary people and reading about the\u00a0gender spectrum, I knew that my identity was valid and that I was not alone. It was a massive relief to finally be able to attach a word to my experiences and know that there were other people like me."

            "text": "Although I have the right to change my gender on my official NHS registration documents, I still haven\u2019t told my GP or updated my gender marker. It\u2019s never really occurred to me, or maybe, on reflection it\u2019s because deep-down I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll change how I\u2019m treated. You can change your name, title, and gender marker at your GP surgery at any time and writing this blog has prompted me to do this."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s important to be aware that changing your gender marker with NHS services may affect whether you\u2019re invited for screening tests. These are tests for certain conditions that are offered based on gender marker. So, for instance, people assigned female at birth are invited for cervical screening from the age of 25 in the UK. Trans masculine people who change their gender marker to male may no longer be invited for screening. The opposite can also be the case. If you\u2019re a trans feminine person but you don\u2019t change your gender marker to female, you may not be invited for breast screening."

        {
            "text": "My experiences as a non-binary person have been the same for me now as any other time in my life. Health professionals and support staff have always treated me with the same respect and care as they would any other person, as it should be. I hope that doesn\u2019t change when I update my gender marker, because we should be treated as human beings first and foremost."

However, because they are not represented in the language around healthcare, they risk losing access to care entirely. If people feel like they\u2019ll be ignored or misunderstood if they seek support, they\u2019re much less likely to do so \u2013 and it\u2019s much more likely that the symptoms will get worse."

            "text": "Learning about non-binary identities has given me the words to articulate something that I didn\u2019t have the language to describe and has enabled me to understand myself a bit better. It is important for me to be true to myself. We change society by being who we are."
