From the start of their work, the review team recognised that it is almost impossible to explore the experiences of children without also considering\u00a0 the role of their families. Not only do families inevitably shape children\u2019s lives, the interactions of parents and guardians with children\u2019s services play a significant role in determining how families navigate the care system. In order to understand the bigger picture, the review team partnered with Policy Lab."

            "text": "For the independent review of children\u2019s social care, we were asked to scratch beneath the surface, by looking at wider family contexts, to understand the impact of the system on the families who navigate it. In particular, we focused on exploring the lived experience of parents or legal guardians of children with a 'child in need plan' or a 'child protection plan'. Taking an ethnographic approach, we aimed to understand how these parents and guardians experience the existing children\u2019s social care system."

            "text": "For the review, we opted to use film ethnography, capturing the experiences of parents and guardians through short films - comprising recorded interviews, footage captured directly by participants and professionally shot clips of contextual situations. The medium of film conveys complex narratives in an accessible format, and can reduce the distance between decision makers and people affected by policies."

It was essential that we put participants first and ensured that our recruitment practices, research methods and final outputs were conducted in a way that prioritised their privacy and wellbeing. Creating an ethics and data protection framework and revising it at different stages of the research was vital. At the same time, we continued working closely with participants and various experts, such as their key workers, to ensure they were comfortable and adequately supported at all times.\u00a0"

We used remote interviews to build rapport and delve into participants\u2019 experiences of the system. We then dived deeper into their lives by asking participants to journal their experiences as video diaries. This created space for them to narrate their stories in their own terms, and to show their lives through their lens. As the COVID-19 guidelines were relaxed, we were able to combine remote engagement with face-to-face interactions with participants. We had the opportunity to visit our two research locations in London and Cumbria. "

Another one honed in on parents\u2019 and guardians\u2019 engagement with social workers and the impact of those interactions on their overall understanding of the system and processes. Other topics included; exploration of families\u2019 experiences of navigating the complex system; gaps between families\u2019 practical needs and the action plans set out by social services; and impacts of children\u2019s social services\u2019 involvement on families, both in positive and negative terms.\u00a0"

Whilst the films are not publicly accessible due to their sensitive nature and to protect participants\u2019 anonymity, they informed the findings of the review. They will continue to be a resource for policymakers in central government, helping decision makers to understand the lived experience of parents in the children's social care system."

The review team stated that without this research project, they would have struggled to hear such rich testimonies from families currently on 'child in need' or 'child protection' plans, contributing to their recommendation for the government to invest \u00a32 billion across 5 years in providing more help for families."

Their stories are now part of a process to transform the care system in a way that can make a meaningful difference for them, and for families for generations to come."
