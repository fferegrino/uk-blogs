And to this day, I am unbelievably proud and grateful I took the chance. When I came out as transgender the response was overwhelming and 12 months on, the kindness and compassion I\u2019ve received leaves me speechless."

I was desperate for people to still see me as Feeley, to say something rather than nothing, to still have a laugh, make jokes and most importantly, still see me as human."

Working on a small unit for individuals with personality disorder, I wanted to be as open as possible about my experience. I believed there was an opportunity for me to change the mindset of prisoners who would never have understood the journey a transgender person embarks on; the trauma it brings or the reasons behind it."

I\u2019m right behind you and I know that I am going to be so much better around my nieces and nephews when I get out because of you.\u201d That one comment reinforces how putting myself out there can have an incredible impact that I may never see."
