            "text": "I became platform product owner for MyNavy in September 2021, shortly after it had moved under the responsibility of Navy Digital. When I took over, I was given three directives. One, MyNavy had to be available to everyone in the Royal Navy. So on top of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, who already had access, that meant Reserves, Civil Servants working under Navy Command, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary."

            "text": "Two, it had to be an internal communications platform. The basis of that already existed, but we\u2019ve supercharged it. We\u2019ve built an announcements feature, which can provide targeted messages to different groups or units all the way down to individuals, branches, specs and trades. And we\u2019ve developed the ability to incorporate images, documents and video content, such as the 60-Second Update that\u2019s posted every two weeks."

            "text": "Then three, it had to offer online uniform ordering. If you\u2019re a doctor working in a hospital in Liverpool and your parent unit is in Middlesbrough, getting a new item of uniform means traveling to Middlesbrough, standing in a queue and hoping they\u2019ve got the right item in your size. But there\u2019s a reserve unit in Liverpool, so why can\u2019t you order your uniform on your smartphone and collect it at the reserve unit two miles away the following week? In partnership with the RAF, and with a fixed budget and 12 week delivery timeline, we built a click-and-collect service as a minimum viable product and rolled it out in early December. To date, the Navy\u2019s had over 900 orders processed through it. The response and sentiment across the force is positive, with users only requesting more functionality and greater reach to UK Strategic Command units."

Armed forces in general are very good at doing what the strategic business aims require, but less efficient at recognising what the serving people actually need. So we\u2019ve done extensive user testing and research to understand how people are using the system and what for, so we can build the enhancements they want, to make their lives easier."

In turn, that\u2019s allowed us to deliver change based on user feedback on a two-weekly sprint cycle. Everyone across the Navy sees iterative enhancements every two weeks, and that\u2019s really powerful."

            "text": "A great example of this was the third Covid vaccination booster. We knew there was probably going to be one, but we didn\u2019t know when. We spoke to RN and RAF healthcare and told them that, in a few weeks\u2019 time, they were going to need people to be able to submit details of their third vaccination. And we asked if they wanted us to build that functionality. They said yes please, and how fast could we do it? Could they have it in the next six months? We made it our priority and, in partnership with Lt Chris Pascoe and the people data warehouse team, we built it out within three weeks. And as a result, thousands of people have been able to use their phone to submit their vaccination details, and have this data fed through into the right system."

In addition, some of the feedback isn\u2019t about MyNavy. It\u2019s about the supporting policies and processes, so we\u2019re passing that on to the right people."
