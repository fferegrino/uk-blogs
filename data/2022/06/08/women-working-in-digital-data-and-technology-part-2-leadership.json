It was a very exciting time to join. The Government Digital Service (GDS) was only a few years old. Having delivered GOV.UK, they encouraged departments like the Home Office to build transactional digital services that met user needs. This was called the Exemplar programme."

Our lack of legacy technology means we can take advantage of existing Government as a Platform products to get services into live quickly, and learn from other more mature departments. These things make my job much easier. We can reuse what\u2019s worked before and can (and do!) trust the people we\u2019ve hired to make good decisions."

I volunteered as a user researcher on a project as part of my corporate objective. The civil service is great for letting you build your skills that way. Later, within my policy team I acted as a service owner for a website and convened another multidisciplinary team to do a small piece of content work. That's how I became more interested in the product and strategy side of DDAT."

In September 2021 I moved into the role of service owner for our Apply for funding service to develop my skills running digital projects. I use my experience of working in a policy team every day, to understand and empathise with my colleagues."
