I\u2019m privileged to not have experienced much overt homophobia, and I came out at a time when it was widely accepted. That is not to say, however, that it wasn\u2019t personally confusing and difficult."

            "text": "I had always been a tomboy, growing up as the only girl with two older brothers, and was very much \u2018one of the lads\u2019 when with friends. I tried to be more stereotypically girly in my teens with long hair and dresses, but it never felt quite right."

            "text": "As a result, I lost all my confidence, and my mental health became increasingly poor. I\u2019m not sure how, but I slowly moved away from these people, and I found solace in a new male friend, who later became my boyfriend. He was nice, kind, gentle and understanding, which were traits I hadn\u2019t really been very exposed to before."

            "text": "So, we decided to move to Nottingham together from Cambridgeshire and get a house. My mental health was still poor, and I struggled to socialise and integrate with others, so I didn\u2019t have the typical \u2018Freshers\u2019 experience that most do when joining University."

Alongside this confusion, I was growing up and my personality was changing. I was becoming more confident, more outgoing, more extroverted. My boyfriend was none of these things and just wanted to stay in and play video games; so, after much discussion and deliberation, we broke up."
