Humans, the ocean, biodiversity, and climate are inextricably linked. The Ocean absorbs over a quarter of the carbon dioxide we produce and plays a vital role in the water cycle and climate system. Covering more than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface the ocean has absorbed 90% of the heat that has occurred in recent decades due to increasing greenhouse gases, with the top few metres of ocean storing as much heat as the Earth\u2019s entire atmosphere."

            "text": "The Ocean is critical for biodiversity, geodiversity with endless ecosystem services. Our Ocean supports our economy with crucial jobs, seafood, and raw materials with the UK home to the widest range of sea life of any European coastal nation. Our Ocean provides a wide range of services that contribute to the wellbeing of people and our planet. Despite this our Ocean, and the life it supports, is increasingly at risk. Although there are still areas of great richness and beauty, the overwhelming weight of evidence shows that our Ocean and Seas have been in decline for decades. Ocean and climate action must be undertaken together; and reversing ocean change needs action now."
