The dominance of Chinese state-owned surveillance in the UK' and the pledge from MPs and rights groups for Hikvision and Dahua to be banned in the UK, along with a nationwide review of the ethics and capabilities of CCTV in the UK."

For those public bodies that have entered into surveillance contracts with these companies I\u2019m very interested to understand how they conducted their due diligence and on what evidence they believe they have created a partnership that can be trusted by the communities they serve."
