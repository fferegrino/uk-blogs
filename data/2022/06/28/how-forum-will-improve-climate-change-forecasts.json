In the 1990s, as a PhD student working with Professor John Harries at Imperial, I used what were, at the time, sophisticated modelling tools to simulate what we might expect the Earth to look like if viewed from space in the far-infrared, or at wavelengths between around 15-100 microns (0.015 - 0.1 mm)."
