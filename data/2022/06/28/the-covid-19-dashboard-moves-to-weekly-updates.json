Vaccination derived protection and treatments have changed the risks of COVID-19 and led a pathway to greater stability."

This follows the typical reporting schedules for other respiratory infections and also aligns COVID-19 reporting for England with Scotland and Wales - which already report COVID-19 data on a weekly basis."

The Government also retains core infrastructure and capabilities to scale up testing if needed. As we move forward and continue to monitor COVID-19 closely, the frequency of reporting data on the COVID-19 Dashboard will be kept under review."
