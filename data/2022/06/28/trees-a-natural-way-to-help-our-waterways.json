Storms like the ones we have recently experienced are on the increase, prompting experts to look for viable long-term solutions to help mitigate the impact of extreme weather conditions."

            "text": "By planting trees in fenced areas adjacent to watercourses preventing access to rivers by livestock, woodland will act as a natural filter and buffer \u2013 reducing the amount of harmful organisms directly entering the water. Likewise, planting blocks of trees can help to intercept spray drift by up to 90% when they have grown and their canopy forms a barrier. Woods also help to soak up nitrates and phosphates, particularly in areas where there are issues with agricultural pollution."

            "text": "Planting trees and shrubs on riverbanks, floodplains, across slopes and in the headlands of a catchment can slow floodwater. A woodland floor is rougher and more difficult for water to negotiate than a grassy field, and it\u2019s this roughness that slows down floodwaters. As they slow, floodwaters tend to drop suspended particles and nutrients in hollows and troughs, and these nutrients are used by the trees to grow."

        {
            "text": "Water that is moving slower has more of a chance to move down into and through the soil to the groundwater below, this all helps to reduce the amount of water from a storm that actually arrives in a river and causes a flood."

            "text": "Trees also help to shade and keep rivers cool during the summer \u2013 providing a vital refuge for wildlife in and around rivers. Shading from planting riverside trees and shrubs can help reduce local stream temperatures. It\u2019s good to have about half of the river in dappled shade, as this can lower average maximum summer water temperatures by about 2\u00b0C \u2013 3\u00b0C compared to open rivers \u2013 that can be the difference between a river being a great place for fish and invertebrates to live or it being really difficult."

            "text": "Research by the Game and Wildlife Conservancy Trust (GWCT) has shown that planting shelter belts can help to reduce lambing deaths as the addition of trees provide somewhere for ewes and lambs to seek refuge in bad weather. Similarly, planting trees on the upwind sides of exposed fields can help to maintain higher soil temperatures and extend growing seasons."

            "text": "The study also showed that when it came to gamekeeping, planting tree species such as wild cherry and crab apple led to a better retention of birds on drives. The birds preferred the natural food found within the newly planted areas, compared to that found within existing maize crops. The trees also had an additional bonus of providing shelter in bad weather, and roost spots for the birds to avoid predators."
