DDaT Week was the first large-scale, hybrid event of its kind for DIT in the post-pandemic world."

So, we made sure that our DDaT Week events were a mixture of hybrid, in-person only and online only to be inclusive of everyone. We asked our DDaT colleagues to add their event ideas and scheduling information to a central document and schedule. This meant we could maintain oversight and ensure a balance of hybrid, in-person and online sessions, avoid duplication of topics and minimise time clashes. It also meant that we could ensure every team and portfolio in DDaT would be represented during the event."

We also held sessions on how to learn Python, Microsoft Teams tips and tricks, live product demonstrations, content design clinics and how to apply for a job in DDaT. The creativity and passion of our DDaT team shone through."

We collaborated with our DDaT colleagues in the Audio-Visual (AV) team to organise the display and sound set-up for the week. Our Facilities team perfected our event space layout and helped us to promote DDaT Week by positioning signage near the office entrances."

We knew our users\u2019 \u201cproblems\u201d: DIT colleagues needed to better understand who DDaT are, how we operate and how we can support them. DDaT Week helped us work towards a solution. We tested it and it worked well, but there are iterations and improvements we will make so it\u2019s even better next time. We are proud of what we achieved in bringing DDaT and DIT closer together and grateful for the time invested by our colleagues.
