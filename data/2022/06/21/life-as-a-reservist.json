Since then, I\u2019ve trained in close to 20 countries, deployed to Afghanistan twice, carried out 400 skydives out of planes and helicopters of all shapes and sizes, and scuba-dived in shipwrecks in tropical seas."

I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll let me try abseiling soon because all this other stuff must be costing the Army a fortune!\u00a0\u00a0"

You could say the Army has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. Training over the occasional weekend adds something interesting into my spare time, and I love the fact I can continue to serve whilst working full-time in the Civil Service. The commitment depends on your unit, but I do most of my training over weekends, evenings and a two-week training package, so it\u2019s reasonably easy to manage, even with a young family.\u00a0\u00a0"

During the last few years, my unit has provided troops to COVID-19 vaccination centres, to Wales crewing ambulances to help local communities during flooding, and to operations in Eastern Europe to bolster regular forces. It's varied, fun and provides an amazing network of people who have a shared connection and a sense of public service.\u00a0\u00a0"

One of the most rewarding elements is the way it brings all walks of life together. My unit has airline pilots, doctors, teachers, painters, mechanics, dog walkers, window cleaners, web designers, whisky distillers and almost every other profession you can think of, all working together to achieve a collective goal. Working with people with such diverse skills and backgrounds helps challenge the way you think and injects new ideas to your ways of working. And let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s always handy to know a couple of good plumbers, mechanics and publicans.\u00a0\u00a0"

I get three weeks leave to take part in training, support from the brilliant CO Armed Forces Network, and my director is really aware of the benefits Reserve service brings to my day job. And now the Civil Service has launched the Great Place to Work scheme, it makes it even more attractive for Reservists and veterans to join the Civil Service for the first time."
