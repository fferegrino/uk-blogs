The redesign was a blur of prototypes, post-its and painstaking pair writing sessions with our colleagues from the service. I believe that the result, though far from perfect, gave rise to the start of a culture shift within our team as well as the wider organisation. We began having regular liaison meetings with our colleagues to ensure changes could be planned and taken into consideration as part of the wider user journey.\u00a0"
