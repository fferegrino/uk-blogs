Today\u2019s Telegraph carries similar commentary."

            "text": "The statutory guidance is intended to support the Environment Agency as they work with farmers to reduce water pollution from agriculture. It explicitly guides the Environment Agency to take into account, when determining whether it is appropriate to take enforcement action, the extent to which farmers have implemented important precautions against pollution, including nutrient application rates, establishing green cover over winter, and incorporating manures into the soil after application."
