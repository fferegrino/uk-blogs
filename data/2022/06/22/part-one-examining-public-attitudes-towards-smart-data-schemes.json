This is the first of two blogs setting out the findings of our public attitudes research.\u00a0"

            "text": "Smart Data refers to the \u201csecure sharing of customer data with authorised third party providers (TPPs), upon the customer\u2019s request\u201d. These providers then use this data to provide innovative services for the consumer or business user, such as automatic switching or better account management. The UK led the world through the introduction of Open Banking, the most advanced and only live Smart Data scheme to date. Open Banking enables customers to share their transaction data with authorised TPPs for services such as improved financial planning, and rounding up spending to put incremental amounts of money into savings. In Consumer Priorities for Open Banking, Faith Reynolds et al. estimated that total coverage of Open Banking could bring a total of \u00a312 billion for consumers and \u00a36 billion for small-and medium-sized (SMEs) each year."

In the communications sector, only 29% said they changed their broadband or mobile phone provider in the past two years. When making decisions about financial and communications products and services, consumers are not necessarily using their consumer data. While 55% said they use their financial data to make these decisions, only 24% use their communications data.\u00a0\u00a0"

Approximately a quarter of respondents in each case were unsure about this trade off. These\u00a0 attitudes strongly vary by age, with under 54s being significantly more supportive, and older respondents more negative.\u00a0 Perhaps unsurprisingly, individuals who said they trusted banks and financial institutions or telecommunication providers were more likely to support Open Finance and Open Communications.

The findings of these focus groups is the subject of our next blog."
