It was my Commanding Officer informing me that we were mobilising a Troop from the Regiment for Operation TELIC in Iraq, and did I want to lead it? He gave me a few days to \u201cthink about it\u201d but after a very quick conversation with my line manager to give them the good news I rang the CO back within the hour."

Such as when the Royal Marines unit on the base decided to start their \u201cShaibah Olympics\u201d off with a bang. Literally. Using 1.5lbs of plastic explosive, putting the entire base onto high alert because we thought we were being mortared. I found the base Commandant in body-armour and helmet under his bed. He wasn\u2019t amused!"

We were able to blag some heavy-duty cable from them that enabled one of the local villages to be reconnected to the power in time for the wife of one of the local civilians that we employed on the base to give birth to their child under electric light. Despite all the politics around the justification for the Iraq war, those of us who were deployed did so in the hope that at a local level we could help make the Iraqi people\u2019s lives a bit better."

I moved to a four-day working week to accommodate the additional demands of my Reservist career. I led the unit through a major transition and change of cap-badge from artillery to Army Air Corps."

The night shifts in the Ops Room were good practice for cutover weekends!"

It developed my leadership skills, resilience, self-confidence & teamwork. I\u2019ve made lifelong friendships, the sort where you can see someone again after years and at once fall back into the stride of shared experiences."
