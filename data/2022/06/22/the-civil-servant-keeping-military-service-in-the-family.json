From eating a sheep\u2019s head in Jordan to rescuing stranded baby turtles on Ascension Island, or evacuating a TV crew from a burning tent, Lesley\u2019s grabbed every opportunity and is now bringing forward the next generation."

This is the real value of what Reservists bring \u2013 we have a different perspective on life, with a foot in both camps. For me, the lesson of seeking to lead (and know) yourself before leading others is key.\u00a0"
