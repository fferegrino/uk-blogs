            "text": "I started with Nuclear Waste Services in January 2022 as a Waste Strategy Specialist. Amongst all the virtual and in-person introductions to my new colleagues both within the Strategic Waste Programme and beyond, as well as induction events, I made a point of contacting the LGBT+ network within my first few weeks. Why did I do this? Because I believe representation matters - it mattered to me when I actively sought it out and even (or perhaps especially) in the times I swore it didn\u2019t matter it all."

            "text": "Like many LGBT+ individuals, I can\u2019t recall the moment I knew I was a lesbian. I remember some furtive Googling happening around the ages 13-14 and noticing the search engine wouldn\u2019t autocomplete a search term containing the word \u201clesbian\u201d (a feature designed to minimise adult content appearing in search results \u2013 since updated) - so I started using the word \u201cgay\u201d reflexively, as I subconsciously learned of this negative association with the term \u2018lesbian\u2019. It doesn\u2019t take much to signal and instigate shame \u2013 especially when you\u2019re questioning yourself and not publicly out."
        },
        {
            "text": "I came out to family and friends around 2010. I remember agonising about the best way to go about it and eventually settled on waiting for it to come up - because it turns out that when you\u2019re 15, you get asked a lot if you have a boyfriend by nosey people! I didn\u2019t want it to be a big deal \u2013 I was, after all, still just me. Same sex marriage was being debated in Parliament and there were LGBT+ characters popping up in TV and films \u2013 so what was I afraid of? Luckily, I received mostly positive reactions, or at least the panicked look of someone well-meaning who doesn\u2019t know the appropriate thing to say. So far, so good then?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sometimes people would say something along the lines of \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t need to come out if you were straight, so why do you need to come out as gay? \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. It\u2019s hard to describe the effect this had on me, as I felt that however well-intended the statement was, it diminished what I was doing. Coming out \u2013 to yourself and others \u2013 can be an incredibly liberating feeling. If you could bottle this feeling and sell it, you\u2019d be a millionaire. Being a lesbian might be one of the least interesting things about me but being able to talk openly about my partner is a small but crucial sign that I can be myself around someone, something I realised much later."

            "text": "In the subsequent years, I went on to university and then work. Engaging with LGBT+ networks was something I flirted with but I struggled to commit meaningful time to at university \u2013 mainly due to the conflict of jobs, study time and socialising. But when I headed into the workplace, I was struck by how often I encountered situations where I felt that my presence and willingness to discuss LGBT+ issues contributed positively to the work environment."
        },
        {
            "text": "I also encountered situations where I overheard offensive comments made about myself or others, and my girlfriend would share her own tales about homophobic encounters she or her colleagues had experienced in work too. This is another sadly common discussion topic in LGBT+ spaces, with many of these incidences only communicated amongst known allies. When incidences like this are allowed to slip by unnoticed or ignored by witnesses, it can compound the negative impact on the victim and contribute to an unwelcoming work environment."
        },
        {
            "text": "I always feel pangs of frustration when I encountered or heard about these events \u2013 it looked like coming out did matter, and that you couldn\u2019t always be yourself after all. I\u2019ve challenged this behaviour in the past, but there have been times where I\u2019ve felt unable to do so due to the prevailing culture of where I worked. It is not just the role of LGBT+ individuals to speak out against this type of behaviour \u2013 this is where LGBT+ allies can play a huge role. I think the right to work in a supportive and inclusive workplace culture has become a greater priority for everyone, so I encourage you to speak out when you encounter unacceptable behaviour."
        },
        {
            "text": "I realise that having grown up in a more progressive time and surrounded by largely supportive people, I (and others) may sometimes take for granted that diversity is hardwired into modern society and will remain so indefinitely, without effort from me or others. LGBT+ representation in the workplace is more than just a rainbow flag or a \u201cnice to have\u201d feature. Without it, ignorance and bigotry can fester and that can pull people down - and not just LGBT+ individuals either; everyone deserves the right to come into work and feel respected and included. I now feel comfortable to be myself at work, and I value that I can share the mundane (and occasionally funny, I like to think) details of my life outside of work with my girlfriend and our lively dog. I hope that those around me do too and will be inspired to do the same."
