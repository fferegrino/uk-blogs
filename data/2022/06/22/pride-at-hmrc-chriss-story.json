That\u2019s especially important for our trans friends and family who suffer the most violence and harassment because, often, they can\u2019t hide their queerness as easily as others can."

Our kids\u2019 primary school is signed up to the excellent No Outsiders initiative. As part of this, some of the year 6 children interviewed my husband (and a few other parents) about their experiences as LGBT+ families. I was at school during section 28. I can\u2019t express how meaningful it is to me that we\u2019ve come so far as a country."

Our senior leaders underline the importance of diversity and inclusion \u2013 it\u2019s a key part of HMRC\u2019s values and strategy. And our LGBT+ Champion Alan Evans vocally and passionately supports the LGBT+ community. In HMRC, whatever your day job, contributions you make to these issues will be highly valued and recognised. But we can always do more \u2013 I\u2019m keen to help us build on past successes and make sure all of our LGBT+ community (especially our trans colleagues) feel able to be their authentic selves at work."
