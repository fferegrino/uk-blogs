            "text": "Wild deer, especially native species, are an important and valued part of our natural heritage. In England, due to several factors including land use changes and a lack of natural predators, deer density and distribution have dramatically increased over the last century, and at such levels pose a significant risk to our woodlands, other animals that rely on this environment and deer themselves."

            "text": "There are six species of wild deer in England: red and roe deer are native; fallow, sika, muntjac and Chinese water deer are introduced species. Populations of wild deer have been increasing rapidly over the last 40 years and may now be higher than at any time in the last 1,000 years."

            "text": "The pressure created by deer, as outlined below, needs to be reduced to allow woodlands and species which inhabit them to flourish, and to prevent economic damage to agricultural crops and trees managed for timber production. As such, the Forestry Commission and Defra are now seeking views on a new deer management strategy. Our aim is to ensure a well-managed and healthy wild deer population in England - a population which is in balance with its ecosystem and which mitigates the threat to long-term environmental or economic sustainability."

They can also play important roles in building flood resilience, and supporting rural economies, such as by supplying timber and wood products as renewable resources."

Too many deer competing for food in the same area can leave the population malnourished and unhealthy and allow diseases to spread. Dense populations also can support spread of other disease and parasites affecting wildlife and humans."
