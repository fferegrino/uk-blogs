It\u2019s great to see so many people embracing opportunities like this to continue to manage their land, in a way that improves food production and at the same time is more environmentally sustainable.\u201d Matt, Future Land Schemes."

It\u2019s inspiring to see what they have achieved and being able to support people to do things like branching out into other sectors or adding value to their business by using what they produce in new ways, is a really rewarding part of the job.\u201d Kirsten, Grants Service."

In doing so, we can better serve our customers. More recently, we\u2019ve introduced new tools and training such as our Farming Calendar and our Customer Excellence Training. We are promoting volunteering within our local communities and hope to continue this journey by building stronger relationships with land-based colleges, so everyone in the RPA, regardless of their background, can better understand the challenges our customers face and the inspiring work they do.\u2019\u2019 Elise, Organisational Capability."
