Some students might access loan systems through their home countries to support their studies and some may also apply for partial scholarships or bursaries from their selected institutions or external organisations."

This has been the case for the last five academic years. Last year, over two million UK\u00a0students\u00a0were studying for a higher education qualification in this country. UK students take up the vast majority of places on university undergraduate courses, accounting for 84.3% of the undergraduate student population."
