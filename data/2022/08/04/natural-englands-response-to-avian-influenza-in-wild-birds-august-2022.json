            "text": "Avian influenza is a seasonally occurring virus and normally, infections are reported between autumn and spring and then virtually disappear over the warmer summer months. It typically affects waterfowl such as ducks and geese as they gather in large flocks over winter before migrating to their summer breeding grounds. This year the strain of virus is more infectious. Large mortalities of geese were reported in the Solway this winter with around 10,000 deaths suspected (25% of the overwintering population)."

        {
            "text": "Due to the changes, infections have continued beyond the normal winter period and now are affecting breeding colonies of seabirds which are not normally affected such as: great skuas, roseate, common sandwich and arctic terns, guillemots, black-headed gulls and gannets. The scale of mortality is unprecedented with significant losses of adult birds and even larger mortality of chicks being reported."

            "text": "The UK is host to globally significant numbers of seabirds and waterfowl, many of which are amber or red status on UK Birds of Conservation Concern and so these impacts represent population level effects and even potential local extinction risks and there is little sign of it abating. There has been a lot of media attention, with particular attention on the Farne and Coquet Islands in Northumberland and more recently Scolt Head in Norfolk as the pictures of dying birds and carcass collections have been shared and the grim reality of the situation sets in."

            "text": "Natural England is advising Defra, working with other agencies and environmental Non-Governmental Organisations such as the British Trust for Ornithology to monitor the situation, assess the risks, provide operational guidance and manage public access where necessary. Our ornithologists and wildlife disease specialists meet weekly with Defra and partners and our local staff are continuously monitoring the situation on the ground."

Other organisations that manage breeding colony sites, such as the RSPB and National Trust, are doing the same. Our approach to tackling this year\u2019s bird flu outbreak continues to be led by international best practice and the latest evidence."

Thankfully, to date, no signs of avian influenza have been observed within the very rare Little Tern colonies.\u201d"

The actual number of dead birds could be significantly higher with many believed to have died at sea. Mortality amongst chicks has been huge, with around 80-85% of all chicks dying and several thousand (around 500kg), mostly terns, removed from the site.\u201d"

            "text": "At some sites where people can normally come into close contact with the birds, public access is being restricted to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus and to protect the birds from disturbance which is an added pressure whilst they are so vulnerable. We are asking visitors to be aware of the risks and behave sensitively; information is being displayed on individual sites. The public are encouraged to report findings of dead wild birds to the Defra helpline on 03459 335577. Defra has published a separate blog around carcass collection."

            "text": "We have been commissioned by Defra to assess the vulnerability of seabird species in light of the pressures they are facing, and to propose recommendations to address them. We are working with a range of partners to do this and hope to be able to report on the impact in more detail in the autumn when we will have the breeding data compiled and a clearer picture. With no sign of the virus going away, we are also working on contingency plans for a sustained outbreak."
