We want to make sure that anonymous foreign owners of UK property reveal their identity, to ensure that criminals cannot hide behind shell companies and use UK property as a means to launder money or for other crime."

This will give us the powers we need to play a more significant role in the fight against economic crime.\u00a0 This legislation has been expedited by the government in recognition of the real difference we can make at Companies House. We\u2019ve been working in partnership with BEIS on the proposed changes and developing policies to support them, as well as instructions for parliamentary lawyers and advice for ministers."
