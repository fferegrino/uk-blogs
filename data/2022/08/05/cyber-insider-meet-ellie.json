Working closely with the NCF, we look at what prompted one employee to begin their career in cyber, the steps they took to get there and ultimately why, in their eyes, a career in the cyber domain is one worth pursuing."

Combining the qualification in cyber security with valuable work experience, the scheme acts as a perfect gateway into a career in the cyber domain.
