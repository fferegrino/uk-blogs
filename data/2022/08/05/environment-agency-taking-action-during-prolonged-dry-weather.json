            "text": "Are we facing the same position now? No, we are in a much better position than in 1976. While Southern Water and Southeast Water are imposing Temporary Use bans (more commonly known as hosepipe bans) we aren\u2019t expecting the use of standpipes or other extreme measures seen in 1976."

        {
            "text": "There are two main differences. The 1976 drought was preceded by a dry year while 2021 was normal in terms of rainfall. The other difference is despite England having a much larger population now, and higher personal water consumption, water companies have been required to invest in better resilience to drought. Water companies are now able to get through a drought like 1975-76 without the need for extreme restrictions (such as standpipes and rota cuts). We are better prepared as water companies have drought plans that set out the actions, they will take to make maximum use of available water as a drought develops, and long-term water resources management plans to increase resilience."

        {
            "text": "A question we often get is whether we can define a drought. We don\u2019t use a single definition for drought so whilst it\u2019s caused by a period of low rainfall, the nature, timing and impacts on people, the environment, agriculture or business will vary. Some droughts are short and intense like a hot, dry summer, while others are long and take time to develop over multiple seasons. The National Drought Group, chaired by the Agency, advises on the impacts seen or anticipated and the actions needed by all sectors to play their part. The Environment Agency decides whether it is helpful to signal a drought or severe drought."

Should this dry weather picture continue, many parts of England will move into drought. This change in status is mainly a classification indicating seriousness, rather than requiring different action. The triggers that influence action and escalation include the hydrological position (including rainfall, river flows, groundwater levels, reservoir levels, soil moisture), as well as the impacts on public water supply, abstractors (including farmers) and on the environment."

The Environment Agency regularly collects most of this information routinely, but we have started to increase our monitoring. Accurate data on river levels and flows are vital to ensure the correct regulatory decisions are made and through July and August we have deployed more people to do spot checks at priority sites and locations. In East Anglia we are now increasing our surveys of invertebrates so we can better inform and manage the impacts of dry weather."
