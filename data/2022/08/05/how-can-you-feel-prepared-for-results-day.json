But many were also worried about what would happen if they did get the results they wanted, as it would mean making a change. For many, the main cause of worry was uncertainty. And things could feel especially uncertain this year, as it is the first time since 2019 that GCSEs and A-levels have been assessed by exams."

Even finding out practical information, such as the bus you will need to catch, can help to reduce uncertainty and make you feel more in control."

We say this because most people at one time or another do not get the results they hope for, but still go on to have a successful life. If you don\u2019t get the grades you hoped for, you may feel upset, disappointed or embarrassed, and that\u2019s completely normal. Planning ahead for what you will do if this happens can help you see that there are ways to move forward and you will be better motivated to put your plan into action if that occurs."
