            "text": "Prior to the UK leaving the EU, catch certificates for exports (300 in total annually) were issued by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for goods exported to countries outside of the EU for processing that were then re-exported to the EU for consumption after processing."

            "text": "We knew too that the existing manual paper-based process would adversely impact exporters, that already placed a significant burden to export to those eight countries. And so, a new digital service to generate Export Catch Certificates would be required."

Enhancements have included: upload of data to improve efficiency, being able to clone a new catch certificate from existing one and creating a journey hub enabling users to complete documents around their business processes. The GOV.uk services are also available in Welsh."
