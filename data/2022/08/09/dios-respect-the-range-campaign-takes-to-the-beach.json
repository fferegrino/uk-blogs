The launch saw the creation of a 100m Chinook helicopter sand artwork that generated national media coverage for this important safety campaign."

More worryingly, hundreds come within close proximity to live training. It\u2019s a testament to our safety marshals, Defence Training Estate staff and Landmarc colleagues that the vast majority are seen and moved on before they are injured (or worse)."

Following a successful pilot in 2021, the campaign has this year been extended to several UK coastal locations shared by the public and the military, including Lulworth, Lydd & Hythe, Donna Nook & Holbeach and Barry Buddon. We are also continuing our work targeting the Salisbury Plain and Aldershot training areas."

[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]The campaign draws upon the mutual respect that exists between the public and our Armed Forces. The public respect the military\u2019s need to train and prepare for deployment, and we respect the public\u2019s desire to explore and enjoy the Defence estate, much of which has public access. This enables people to discover some of the most beautiful and unique rural areas in the UK."

Firstly, to engage with beach-goers using a sand sculpture of a Type 2 Challenger tank as an eye-catching conversation starter. Secondly, to produce a giant, visually stunning piece of sand artwork that would capture media interest and provide a platform to share our campaign\u2019s key safety messages."

From ground level it was difficult to fully immerse yourself in the image, but once the drone was sent up to capture the full context, the drawing was breath-taking. One of the propeller blades alone was 45m in length!"

At the time of writing, the campaign launch news story has been picked up in over 25 national and regional media outlets including the BBC, The Independent and The Guardian. That means far more people will have seen it than just those at the beach last week, and hopefully it will stick in their minds and they\u2019ll remember to be responsible and safe when accessing training areas."

More importantly, it helps establish the campaign with many sections of our audience and adds credibility and authority to our safety message. The project has been a real endorsement of DIO\u2019s core values \u2013 working together with multiple stakeholders as one team and leaning into the skills and knowledge of partners to deliver an excellent campaign launch event, the first of its kind for DIO."
