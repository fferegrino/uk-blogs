Children are encouraged to set themselves a reading goal and then borrow books from their local library. They receive fun incentives and rewards as they read, and it is all totally free to take part."

We know that the programme helps to tackle the \u2018dip\u2019 in reading engagement some children experience during the school holidays, as well as increasing their confidence with reading and overall well-being."

The focus for 2021 was nature and the environment, and we saw first-hand how engaged children and families were with this topic, as well as our library partners and schools. It was clear that children were motivated to learn about the world around them and how to make a real difference to their community and their future."

The 2022 \u2018Gadgeteers\u2019 Summer Reading Challenge will show children that science is for everyone, and that innovation and invention are all around us. We believe that science and reading are perfect partners \u2013 both requiring creativity, curiosity, and imagination, and able to unlock a world of potential in children and young people."
