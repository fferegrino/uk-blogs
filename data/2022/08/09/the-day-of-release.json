We have undertaken user research to identify their needs and challenges when it comes to the day of release, as well as the needs of the frontline staff that provide services and support during that crucial day. Engaging with stakeholders across the criminal justice system and co-designing how we can best improve outcomes for people leaving prison has been integrated into our practice. We want the day of release to be a springboard for a stable life."

All these things play an important part in reducing the risk of reoffending on release through improved resettlement for those leaving prison."

For example, people leaving prison can have difficulties attending all their appointments on release due to lack of resources and the distance between them. Based on our research, we have identified areas of opportunity to better support prison leavers on the day of release. These opportunities include exploring whether what is currently happening on the day of release can instead be done pre-release, easing time and psychological pressure on prison leavers, and creating multi-agency ways of working where services can collaborate to maximise resources and streamline efforts."
