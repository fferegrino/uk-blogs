So, they are incredibly important to the biodiversity of towns and cities especially."

As you can probably see from our pictures, we\u2019ve cultivated some areas for fruit and veg but left other areas quite wild to give habitat for insects and wildlife. We don\u2019t keep any animals as such, at least not yet\u2026\u2026."

            "text": "Bugs are important to the healthy functioning of allotments. As gardeners we tend to focus on the \u2018pests\u2019 and ignore all the work the other bugs are doing for us - like pollinating our fruit and veg, controlling pests or improving our soil."

            "text": "Our allotment produces enough food to reduce the cost of our weekly shop (which will be of increasing help during the current cost of living crisis). It also helps to bring our carbon footprint down, as our fruit and veg are all produced locally, without a supply chain. We try to avoid using pesticides, to minimise ingesting the sorts of chemicals that are likely to be present on shop bought fruit and vegetables."

I can flex my hours and manage my deadlines, knowing that if I do need to get to the allotment to do something, such as watering during the dry period, then I can do that and can make the time up later on."
