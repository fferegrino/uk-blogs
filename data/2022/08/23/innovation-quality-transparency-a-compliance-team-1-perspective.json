This blog relays some of our reflections."

            "text": "While this still of course adds quality value, moving forwards, quality professionals are the enablers of product development from the outset, and have a key role to play within organisations aiming to innovate.\u00a0 The quality function cannot do this alone however, it can only work effectively with a full team approach across the organisation, with quality built in from the start.\u00a0 This includes working across pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory, post-authorisation, strategy and policy groups to enable a joined-up approach, with patients at the centre of risk assessments and the resulting decisions made."

            "text": "There has been much focus on transparency, both from regulators and also between regulators and industry, which ties in directly to the risk-based approach that the MHRA has been championing since 2011.\u00a0 Uptake in the right direction, with industry and academia reviewing how they can be as transparent as possible with regulators on their risk assessments for trials; what the most important risks are, how they are mitigated, and what the issues were.\u00a0 Some have already moved to submitting this information directly either through marketing authorisation applications internationally, or through our Innovative Licensing & Access Pathway (ILAP) in the UK: \u00a0Future updates to the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations and look to push risk adaptation into the forefront of planning and managing clinical trials. This can only be a good thing."

            "text": "We are in the early stages of seeing this type of activity, but from the MHRA perspective - quality input built into these risk assessments and transparent release of this detail to regulators is exactly what is required to support innovation.\u00a0 As trial designs become more complex and we see an increasing level of decentralised ways-of-working, issues are bound to occur \u2013 we should embrace these setbacks and learn from them for the good of public health.\u00a0 Innovation will never come without some risks; the challenge is to ensure those risks are managed and mitigated to ensure they do not become too large or irreversible where this is possible; but where it is not then we need to be looking for where issues may arise and be ready to act."

            "text": "We would encourage you to take these opportunities to risk adapt where appropriate, to risk assess, manage the risks and transparently discuss them.\u00a0 We have heard from patient representatives recently that \u2018time is life\u2019 and that we need to move to \u2018how soon can we make this available to my child to improve their quality of life\u2019 when we think about getting new medicines to patients in need.\u00a0 We are all working towards that same goal. Working across boundaries to reach that aim is an exciting prospect."
