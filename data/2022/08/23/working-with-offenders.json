This can be in a variety of different forms, including compiling breach reports for court, sending out warning letters, setting out behavioural contracts, looking at alternatives to recall to custody such as directing someone to reside in an Approved Premises and completing recall reports if the risk is not manageable in the community."

This involves reporting breaches to the police for investigation. Challenging any breaches of rules is vital, as well as outlining the expectations and consequences of non-compliance at the earliest stage."

In the early stages following release, contact could be regular so I could provide support to help someone resettle back into community life. This included completing home visits and I would sometimes go along to external appointments, such as required appointments with the drug service."

The risk management plans in place can include external controls such as curfews, GPS monitoring and enforceable appointments to address risk factors such as alcohol misuse. We also work closely with partner agencies such as the police, helping to ensure compliance on external controls, like sexual harm prevention orders."

If someone is out on licence after serving a custodial sentence, they will be subject to licence conditions and chosen to manage the identified risk factors, being proportionate to their assessed level of risk. If someone is on a community order, whilst the risk factors may be similar, the conditions of this order will differ and change how we manage the risk."

There was a lot of paperwork to complete, but it helped me to structure the appointment. The Person on Probation was keen to go home as soon as possible as he came to the office straight from prison, so I had to be boundaried and firm in order to cover all the relevant information with him."
