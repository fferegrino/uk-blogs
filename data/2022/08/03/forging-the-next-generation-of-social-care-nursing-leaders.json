I want to \u2018level up\u2019 our nurses\u2019 professional and personal experiences of social care, with their equally capable and dedicated colleagues in the NHS, where staff of all backgrounds, circumstances and aspirations have access to quality leadership development and support."

They may also have additional responsibilities as operational or registered managers."

Sadly, this diversity is not reflected at senior management and leadership level, with only 16% of registered or senior managers from a minority ethnic background."
