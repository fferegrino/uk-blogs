We both want detergent to clean our clothes, but we\u2019re using different language to describe it. This is alright if we\u2019re in the supermarket, because we know we need the laundry essentials aisle \u2013 then we can browse the shelves for the exact product we want."

But I might call them \u2018school lunches\u2019 and you might say \u2018school dinners\u2019. Inside the search engine, the subject taxonomy connects all these terms, so that searching for any one of them always gives the right results, which saves us time."
