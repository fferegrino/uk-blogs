Our aim is to radically transform how customers use our services and transact with us using an agile and iterative delivery approach, utilising our main strategic tenets, API enabled cloud native services development, and cloud first platform provisioning to move away from our legacy technology estate. This transformation creates a scalable, secure, and sustainable platform, enabling us to reduce the time, complexity, and cost of developing and deploying new customer services and business capabilities"

Our digital change of address on your vehicle log book (V5C) service took only 6 weeks to develop during the pandemic - previously it would have taken at least 6 months. This was quickly followed by the launch of our online duplicate log book (V5C) service in just 12 weeks, again during the most challenging of times."

This means that lorry and bus drivers can apply and pay online, making the process much quicker and easier than ever before. It\u2019s been a real success, with positive feedback from customers and online take up over 90%. This has paved the way for future services to move on to cloud technology, so we won\u2019t have to start from the beginning every time."

This was a significant milestone in our ongoing transformation programme, with more than 460,000 customers using the service since its launch."
