As a result, it is on Historic England\u2019s Heritage at Risk Register.\u00a0"

Therefore, the goal of the excavation was to gather as much information as possible about the site and those who lived there, hopefully allowing it to be removed from the Heritage at Risk Register in the process. DIO has also arranged for scrub to be cleared from the site which will allow Historic England to carry out a drone survey. This will be used to create a detailed model of the site to demonstrate changes over time.\u00a0\u00a0"

Regardless, increasing understanding of the site and the surrounding historic landscape and preserving as much as possible by record will create a valuable resource for current and future generations to study and understand.\u00a0"

A small amount of pottery was also found. This will need to be cleaned up and properly dated in due course, but the team tentatively dated it as ranging from mid-late Iron Age.\u00a0\u00a0"

Obviously, safety was therefore the top priority in the planning of the dig and throughout. The site was cleared by a UXO team before the excavation commenced and a unexploded ordnance expert was on site at all times in case of any discoveries a bit more modern than the Iron Age. All participants had to be briefed on the limits of the cleared area so they didn\u2019t stray into potentially dangerous territory.\u00a0\u00a0"

Lots of the passers-by were interested in what the team were up to and the participants and archaeologists were happy to field their questions and explain their theories about the site. \u00a0"

The excavation was successful thanks to the hard work and enthusiasm of the participants and the support from colleagues in the Army and DIO, demonstrating how seriously we take our responsibilities to protect our heritage.\u00a0"
