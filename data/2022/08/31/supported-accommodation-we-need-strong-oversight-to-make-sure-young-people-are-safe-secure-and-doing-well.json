Quality standards and regulatory oversight are, therefore, absolutely necessary."

Supported accommodation can mean single-occupancy flats or larger hostel-type provision that may accommodate people aged over 18 who may not be care experienced. It can include \u2018supported lodgings\u2019 in a private home or relatively small \u2018group living\u2019 arrangements."

And the figure appears to be rising steadily. Although it\u2019s not a direct comparison, it\u2019s more than double the number of children in care who were reported to be in semi-independent or independent accommodation in 2014."

The overall lack of sufficiency is undoubtedly contributing to the rise in the number of young people in supported accommodation, and we will work with government and colleagues across the sector to help address that urgent issue separately."

Whatever type of support that young people receive, we will expect it to meet young people\u2019s individual needs and that the decisions taken on their behalf are led by their best interests. Regardless of the wider policy context, when practice falls short, we will report that and take any necessary enforcement action."

This is critically important. No one wants regulation to lead to unnecessary uncertainty or instability for young people. Planning needs to take account of the expectation that the regulations and standards will become mandatory before the end of 2023."

To that end, we expect to have the help of care experienced people to co-design our consultation. Of course, their views on what good support looks like will be central to our thinking.

There\u2019s a range of opportunities to make that difference \u2013 not just in supported accommodation. Please share widely!"
