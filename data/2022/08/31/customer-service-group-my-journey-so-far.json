I was nervous about applying because I\u2019ve always wanted to work for HMRC, my dad worked at HMRC all his working life and I wanted to follow in his footsteps."

I had to record my answer to three questions and then submit them. After the interview, I waited a few weeks and then one morning I opened my emails to an email congratulation me on my successful application!"

But we were still coming out of the pandemic. Spending my first couple of weeks at home, I was able to read over the materials I had been sent by the Onboarding team. My laptop and IT equipment were also sent out to me and once it arrived, to my surprise, I was able to set everything up relatively easily as I\u2019m not the best with new technology. I then made a start on the online learning modules to get me ready for my formal training that started in week 3."

From simple tax code changes to more complex cases of adding multiple employer benefits to a tax code, and everything in between. After the training, I had another few weeks of dedicated \u2018floor walking support\u2019 to get me through those all-important first calls."

The investment time is normally with my team leader, and I choose what I want to discuss. For example, when I first joined, I really struggled with car benefit, so I mentioned this to my team leader. We then spent our investment time going over this aspect of my role until I became more confident. Now when I get a call about it, I feel confident and know how to deal with it."
