Use cases such as flooding mitigation, natural resource management and land administration brought to life the potential influence that the IGIF and other UN-GGIM guiding frameworks can have when implemented. Several countries cited the Global Statistical Geospatial Framework (GSGF) as an important part of their national census planning and the Framework for Effective Land Administration (FELA) as crucial in securing land rights and modernising national systems for land registration."
