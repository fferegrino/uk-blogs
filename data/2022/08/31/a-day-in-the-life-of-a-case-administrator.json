We send details to the probation team so they've got the picture of what needs to happen on probation with that person. They also can learn how many people on probation have accommodation and employment. We send out breach notices if someone has failed to attend or comply with their appointment."

You have a really big impact on so many people within the organisation and people on probation. We are a very big support role."
