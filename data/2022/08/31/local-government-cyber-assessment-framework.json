Not only is there the risk of a huge financial cost to respond and rebuild, cyber attacks also threaten the delivery of critical services like social care and revenues and benefits payments, with serious real-life impacts for citizens."

            "text": "One of our core objectives at Local Digital is to work with councils to assess and manage the cyber risk to local government. Through past user research, we found that there are many cyber standards, but no clear baseline for local government. This makes it difficult for cyber responsible people within councils to know which improvements to prioritise, and build a convincing business case for investment."

This will guide councils to better understand their cyber posture and what steps they can take to improve it. It will also ultimately help us as a department to better understand \u2013 and act to help address - vulnerabilities across the sector."

This will be underpinned by the adoption of the NCSC\u2019s Cyber Assessment Framework as a common way of assessing cyber risks, with specific CAF profiles guiding organisations as to which outcomes they should be fully or partially achieving to proportionately respond to the varying threats to their functions."
