            "text": "Since joining RPA, my temporary job for the first couple of months has been on the Rural Payments helpline, helping customers during the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) 2022 claim window. This gave me a good grounding and background knowledge of my work area and also a chance to interact with customers before moving over to my permanent role as a SFI Operational Delivery Team Member."

            "text": "My main responsibility overall is to process the SFI 2022 applications we receive. However, throughout the SFI Private Beta (this is where we invited a select group of customers to apply early for SFI and provide feedback on the processes/systems to ensure there were no issues prior to the launch) I was given the opportunity to get involved further and have now moved to a new Early Adopters Team (EAT). The EAT is a team of processors set up to process SFI application and help with any queries customers have regarding the application process and provide assistance where needed. This involves testing processes and providing feedback to ensure systems, processes and guidance is all running smoothly for both advisors and customers."

As part of the Early Adopters team, I have additional responsibilities to carry out such as assurance checks and constantly providing feedback on guidance and processes to help develop the services we provide."

A big part of my job is communicating with my team and sharing ideas, as well as constantly supporting each other through the work that we do \u2013 I\u2019m really lucky to have such an amazing team!"

            "text": "The aspect of my role which has the greatest impact on our customers is the assurance checking and progressing applications, as this ensures the customer is offered the correct amount of eligible land to claim on, their application is offered as quickly as possible and in turn we\u2019re helping farmers make great environmental and sustainable choices."

            "text": "I thoroughly enjoy the problem solving and investigating aspect of my role as I find this really engaging, but the thing I love the most is the ability to communicate directly with our customers as people are at the heart of what we do! It\u2019s great that we can communicate with farmers and build rapport.\u00a0 If there was any way that we could provide further support, it would be by encouraging more communication, which will allow us to continuously improve and make our service the best it can be."

I think it\u2019s really important to keep in touch with friends too, and although life gets busy, I always try to make plans for a catch-up. I\u2019m also a massive food enthusiast and will never turn down an opportunity to try a new restaurant or cuisine."
