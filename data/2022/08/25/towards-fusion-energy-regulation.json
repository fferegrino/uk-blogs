This climate crisis is linked to our carbon-fuelled economy. At the UN climate summit Conference of the Parties (COP26), global leaders agreed to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. To do this we need to decarbonise our economy and halve global carbon dioxide emissions by the early 2030s and reach net zero by the mid-century. The term net zero means achieving a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere and the carbon removed from it, so we\u2019re not putting more into the atmosphere than we can remove."

            "text": "As part of its net zero targets, the UK Government is aiming for a fully decarbonised power system in the UK. The system needs to be reliable which means that intermittent renewables should be complemented by technologies which can consistently and continually provide power, for example when the sun isn\u2019t shining for solar power to be used. Fusion could be the ultimate clean power solution, representing a low carbon, safe, continuous and sustainable source of energy."

JET is the world\u2019s largest and advanced tokamak \u2013 an experimental machine that uses magnets to contain and compress a plasma of charged particles to achieve a fusion reaction. We were interested to understand how UKAEA handle and recover tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used in fusion reactions."

Simply, this means firing a high-speed projectile at a target containing fuel. An increase in pressure from the impact squashes the fuel and fusion takes place. Their \u201cbig friendly gun\u201d (BFG), the UK\u2019s largest two-stage gas gun, is used to test new target designs."
