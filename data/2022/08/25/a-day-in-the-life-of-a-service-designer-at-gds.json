When I\u2019ve done work like this before, I\u2019ve worked closely with a variety of roles like product managers, economists and user support specialists.\u00a0 \n\nAs a service designer in this setting, I\u2019ve run workshops to map feedback from users to different parts in the journey they take through the service. This helped the team identify the root causes of the problems and to prioritise which area to focus on improving next. User support specialists can then forecast how this would impact support. Economists can then help model the cost saving benefit of solving that problem."
