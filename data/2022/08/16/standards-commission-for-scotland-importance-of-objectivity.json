Its role is to strengthen ethical standards in public life; including promoting the Codes of Conduct and issuing guidance to councils and devolved public bodies; and to adjudicate on alleged breaches of the Codes of Conduct, and where a breach is found, to apply a sanction."

To have trust and confidence in local authorities and in devolved public bodies, the public need to be satisfied that decisions made by councillors and board members are being made objectively and solely on merit. This includes not just decisions in respect of services, but also ones relating to appointments, the awarding of contracts or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits. The need for holders of public office to act objectively is fundamental, especially at a time when levels of trust in elected representatives are eroding."

Quasi-judicial and regulatory matters include decisions on planning applications and applications for alcohol, betting and gaming premises, and taxi licences, which will often have a significant impact on not only the applicant and any objectors, but also on others in the local community."
