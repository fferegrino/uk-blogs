I decided to apply to the programme as I wanted to be able to do more work with people on a one-to-one basis, to try and make a difference. I liked the variety of jobs available within the Probation Service, such as working in courts, prisons and the community. I also wanted a job which was more regular hours, rather than the shift pattern I was on as a prison officer."

On Vocational Qualification (VQ)/university study days I would struggle to switch off from my PSO work and focus just on my studies. I found that I would often be contacted by the office on these days for issues with my caseload for recalls to custody. I then found myself doing a fair bit of work outside of work hours to ensure I could get all my university work completed and gather VQ evidence."

This was helpful as the SPO would focus on us specifically as trainees, and would give detailed feedback on our work. We also had our practice tutor assessor, who was based in my office, so I could go to them with any queries at any point."

It\u2019s important to be able to switch off and have a solid work-life balance. Time management and prioritisation of work is key, so focus on these skills in the application process.
