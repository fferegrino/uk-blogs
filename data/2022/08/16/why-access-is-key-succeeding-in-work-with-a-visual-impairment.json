I mean an equal chance to change the world, lead large organisations or anything else you put your mind to."

When I reflect back now it was a combination of my own lack of confidence about whether my visual impairment actually was going to limit my career, and my employer being quite nervous to make sure I was receiving the support I needed. I didn\u2019t feel in control of the narrative I and others were telling about me and I\u2019d started to stop \u2018just being myself\u2019."

For example, I find that, because it is inefficient to rely on written materials or notes, I almost automatically retain lots of technical information in my head and call upon it pretty easily. Likewise, I developed a natural way of communicating verbally because I wasn\u2019t able to rely on reading from scripts or referring to notes. I also find it hard to pick up on body language. Most leadership textbooks would have me believe this is a problem, but I find it means I pay absolute attention to the things people say and, perhaps more importantly, the things they are not saying. This often proves invaluable when coaching or mentoring, supporting my teams or cutting through to the root cause of a problem in a crisis."

But I believe it\u2019s someone\u2019s curiosity and desire to unlearn bad habits or to learn new skills which sets them apart from the crowd. I don\u2019t think my ability to learn is anything special, but I think my desire to challenge myself and others to be curious to explore new approaches and ideas is greater than most. \u200b\u200b"
