A prison\u00a0system\u00a0\u2014 one that ensures safety and promotes rehabilitation \u2014 has an infinite number of component elements, all of which are interrelated and continuously changing, often in unpredictable ways.

For those kinds of problems \u2014 even the most complicated ones \u2014 we bring in the experts and let them analyse the situation and draw up a blueprint for how to best fix it. Think of a skyscraper \u2014 you hire an architect to map out exactly how everything will fit together, and then building engineers with expertise in each step of the process. But in that case, you are able to map out exactly what the end solution will look like from the beginning. The ground is not shifting beneath you."

We must tackle those challenges differently, through a process of probing, sensing how things change, and reacting to those changes \u2014 in other words, a process of quick, continuous, and never-ending experimentation. You want to reduce crime and make communities safer in this particular society at this particular moment in its cultural, economic, and political history\u2026 you want to educate young people more effectively, improve people\u2019s health, make work more rewarding\u2026 there is no blueprint for any of these, the \u2018answers\u2019 will only be found through continuous rapid experimentation."

After understanding how the service could function, identifying what technologies existed, going through procurement exercises, and building out and testing the online and offline aspects of the service, we had to then tackle complicated technological and policy questions around cost and security. Now that we\u2019ve fully rolled out the service to all 100+ prisons and ironed out many of the kinks, other questions will surely arise. How might we use the service to achieve wider goals around safety, building people\u2019s skills, and helping secure accommodation before people are released from prison. As technology changes in the future, will our cost and security models need to change too?"

That wider work will also continue, forever. We need teams that are in it for the long haul \u2014 managing (or \u2018stewarding\u2019) systems to continuously perform more efficiently and achieve society\u2019s goals."
