Civil servant Nicola Lazenby from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy joined the volunteers (aka the Commonwealth Collective) as Team Leader for the Netball Athletes Services.

It\u2019s my third Commonwealth Games \u2013 I can\u2019t wait. Today is venue training and I collect my all-important accreditation. Not only will it get me into the venue \u2013 it also secures my packed lunch! Very important."

We forged a sense of family with talented, enthusiastic volunteers and shared memorable conversations. They ranged from our love of netball to the menopause, mental health, right through to sustainability, our carbon footprints and heat pumps (of course!)"
