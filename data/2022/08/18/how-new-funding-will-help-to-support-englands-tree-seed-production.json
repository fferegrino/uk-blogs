The grant forms part of the government\u2019s Nature for Climate Fund, which aims to create, restore and protect vital climate-regulating ecosystems including peatlands and woodlands."

            "text": "The grant also aims to improve the diversity of England\u2019s seed supply, for example, by increasing the range of species and provenances available. This will be crucial for creating diverse and resilient woodlands, which are better able to adapt to future climate conditions as well as new pests and diseases."

Seed sourcing strategies for these species will be published when the grant opens for applications. Projects which deliver against these strategies will be prioritised for financial support and eligible for up to 100% funding."

Funding will therefore be open to proposals covering any species listed in the UK FRM scheme, including those in the voluntary scheme. Projects designed to enhance the supply of non-priority species will be eligible for funding of up to 50%."

We will be encouraging applications from any UK-based public, private or third sector organisation that can demonstrate how the grant will be used to create new or improve existing English Seed Stands and Seed Orchards. Individual private landowners may also apply for eligible activities on their own land."
