            "text": "Prolonged exposure to dry conditions can impact trees in several ways. Initially, trees have natural responses which help them cope with these conditions. These can include increasing root development to encourage uptake of more water and reducing water loss from leaves during the hottest periods. Early signs include wilting of leaves/needles, and in these initial stages trees are usually able to recover from these conditions."

        {
            "text": "As periods of dry weather continue, trees\u2019 responses to the weather conditions can become detrimental to their ability to photosynthesise, their growth may be restricted, and permanent cell damage and loss of whole shoots, branches and roots can occur. In young trees it is likely that extended periods of exposure to drought will result in tree death."
