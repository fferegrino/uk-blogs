This is to help us do the right thing in our day-to-day jobs and keep colleagues\u2019 attention focused on accessibility. Our group includes staff from a range of professions, from content and design to product marketing and service assurance. We are committed to helping the department meet accessibility standards. We want to share how producing accessible content and services helps our colleagues and users."

I have been really impressed by the team who have rallied together to help us do the best job that we can. Many are colleagues starting their careers who have taken passionately to this area, making me feel very optimistic about the future of our services."

            "text": "All information must be perceivable and accessible by more than one sense. For example, if a user cannot see something they should be able to hear it by using a screen reader. It is important that all images in our communications have alternative (alt) text or are marked as decorative, and that documents or webpages are structured correctly."

Using plain English and keeping sentences to a maximum of 25 words are techniques that can help with this. This also benefits users whose first language is not English, which is the case for some of my DIT colleagues. Hemingway App is an example of a useful tool for spotting potentially complex content for a user."

This means that we regularly work with colleagues who may be less confident with accessibility regulations and producing accessible content. With document types such as PDFs, this can cause real problems. Due to how flexible they can be as a publication format, it\u2019s very easy to design a PDF in a way that can never be made accessible. This means teams can spend time producing a document that we have to reject because it has been impossible to resolve accessibility issues."

We are advising the stakeholders we work with that accessibility must be considered from the very beginning and be a fundamental part of the design process. We\u2019ve also worked to introduce accessibility conditions to any reports produced externally, meaning reports cannot be commissioned without accessibility regulations being met as a necessary requirement."

In instances where the GDS Design System isn\u2019t being used, we\u2019ve created other systems.
