The major impetus was the expansion in trade following the end of the Second World War. The precursor to the current system can be traced back to 1949, leading to the Customs Co-operation Council Nomenclature (CCCN), with several updates over the next twenty years."

Designed as a common nomenclature allowing all types of goods to be assigned a unique code when they cross economic borders. As of December 2018, the HS system is used by over 200 economies and customs or economic areas. Its primary purpose is the classification of goods enabling governments to know what is being traded and enabling collection of import duties."

For example, typewriters ceased to need their own code, whilst the development of microelectronics required additional classifications to capture the pattern of trade across a range of new products. Since its inception in 1988 amendments have been introduced approximately every five years, with the current update introduced in January 2022."
