To support trailblazer groups, we have produced common KSBs for each principle and characteristic at different levels, along with associated end point assessment (EPA) grading descriptors. With thanks to employers and stakeholders such as the UK Green Building Council, these are now being used by trailblazer groups and will continue to be refined where needed. This will help speed up revision and development work and reduce the burden on employers time."

We have been working with partners such as CLC, CITB, BSI and SDS on this and we all share the same ambition. The outputs from this work will be seen over coming months."
