The annual event is used to commemorate Sir Ronald Ross\u2019 discovery in 1897 that female Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria between humans."

To provide some context, over one million human deaths occurred globally due to mosquito-borne disease in 2020 alone, and an estimated 627,000 of these were due to malaria. It seems, even with our deep understanding of mosquito-borne disease, the global disease burden is set to remain high.\u00a0"

            "text": "Mosquitoes for their part, are, I am sure, unaware of their impact on disease transmission. Like us, mosquitoes require suitable nutrition to survive. Both male and female adult mosquitoes consume nectar, which is sugar rich, providing carbohydrates for energy. Female mosquitoes also require protein for egg production (termed oogenesis), they get this through consuming blood. Many pathogens have \u2018piggybacked\u2019 on this interaction to jump between hosts or to complete lifecycles. Therefore, when a female mosquito feeds on a vertebrate, unbeknownst to her, pathogens may indirectly be transmitted and ultimately cause disease."

The initial detection of Usutu virus in the UK was in mosquitoes and birds, to date no human infections have been recorded. The detection of Usutu virus is an important milestone in our national biosecurity, as it implies that other mosquito-borne diseases might emerge here in the future."

            "text": "Usutu virus mostly impacts passerine birds, especially blackbirds, but the risk to humans is considered relatively low. \u00a0Recent work from APHA scientists, in collaboration with the IoZ, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has shown that the initial emergence of Usutu virus may have caused a rapid, local decline in blackbird numbers in Greater London. This decline has been corroborated by the recent BTO/Joint Nature Conservation Committee/Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Breeding-Bird Survey which also shows a marked decline in blackbirds in Greater London in 2020."

Differentiating between these two mechanisms will provide a greater understanding of how mosquito-borne viruses emerge and persist in new environments and will enable us to elucidate if the UK is permissive for the long-term establishment of such viruses."

This is the furthest north this virus has been detected and highlights the importance of understanding its continuing geographic expansion to safeguard UK biosecurity."

            "text": "West Nile fever is a notifiable disease of horses in the UK and potentially has a greater impact on animal and public health when compared with Usutu virus. As West Nile virus is now present at high latitudes it is becoming increasingly feasible that it will emerge in the UK in the future, but any long-term impacts are difficult to predict. The APHA routinely conducts surveillance for West Nile virus in the UK, and to date (August, 2022) there have been no detections."
