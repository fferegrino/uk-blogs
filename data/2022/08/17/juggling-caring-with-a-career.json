This worry grew once I got into my teens, as both parents began to develop serious health problems. We lived in a small town in Wales without huge career prospects, so I moved to Cardiff (about an hour\u2019s drive away) when I finished university. But, there always seemed like a dark cloud looming on the horizon, particularly now that there was some distance between us.\u00a0\u00a0"

We were expected to work long hours to put the needs of the business first. Even when I worked in field sales, although there was some scope to work from home, our calendars were carefully monitored to make sure we weren\u2019t working from home too much! Working part-time or compressed hours wasn\u2019t an option with these roles either \u2013 if you couldn\u2019t manage at least 40 hours a week, it was time to find a new job. In the end, I just accepted that I would need to make the most of having a full-time job and living away from home, as inevitably, I would need to regress my career to allow me to move back in with my parents as an unpaid carer.\u202f\u00a0"

I hadn\u2019t considered a career in the Civil Service before, but someone randomly recommended a job to me on Twitter, so I applied during the pandemic despite not knowing much about being a civil servant. I was successful in securing a role as a Band O Compliance Caseworker and started with HMRC in March 2021 \u2013 the time where everyone was still working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u202fIt felt a bit strange starting a new job completely remotely and only meeting my colleagues virtually, but everyone was incredibly warm and welcoming. It didn\u2019t take long for me to realise I\u2019d made the right choice by moving to the public sector.\u00a0"

However, this became a more permanent arrangement when my dad had a heart attack and was diagnosed with severe heart failure in June 2021, and then a few months later in November, my mum became mostly bedbound due to severe osteoarthritis. With both needing care and no other family to provide support, it fell to me to be the sole carer of my parents.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

I have had a few managers since joining HMRC and all have been incredibly understanding and supportive. They have given me the opportunity to tell them what I need in order to be successful as both a civil servant and carer. HMRC already has many flexibilities in place that can help you juggle \u2018regular\u2019 life commitments and responsibilities, such as a flexible working policy and the ability to work from home a few days each week.\u00a0\u00a0"

I started to feel anxious when I found out that we would have to return to the office, as I really couldn\u2019t see how I would juggle being back in Cardiff for most of the week and caring for my parents. However, everyone has been overwhelmingly understanding, and I have been supported in making a request for a \u2018special working arrangement\u2019 to work from home until I can get support from social services in place.\u202f\u00a0"

Recently I was successful at obtaining a promotion as HO Business Change Manager, but instead of being happy and excited, I again found myself feeling anxious about whether my new team would be as understanding about my caring responsibilities as my current manager. I feel kind of embarrassed for worrying so much now! Before starting, a grade 6 and 7 from the team made some time to talk to me and instantly reassured me that my caring responsibilities wouldn\u2019t be an issue. My new line manager has been especially fantastic \u2013 she eased any worries I had and has even already started talking about furthering my development too.\u202f\u00a0"

It\u2019s not the most pleasant thing to have to think about, but it\u2019s true, and not many people give it much consideration. I feel so much more at ease knowing I\u2019m working for an organisation that understands this, and whatever may happen in my personal life, I\u2019ll have support from my employer. I know a lot of companies really promote their interest in wellbeing, diversity and inclusion these days and it\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s just a marketing gimmick or tick- box exercise. But I can honestly say that it\u2019s sincere in HMRC.\u202fI\u2019m so grateful to that random person on Twitter for recommending HMRC to me - I hope I can be the random person that convinces you to apply too!\u202f\u00a0"
