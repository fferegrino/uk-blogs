            "text": "July was the driest July in England since 1935, and since records began for the East and Southeast. \u00a0Most of the country is now in drought. As we approach the end of the summer, water is still as critical as ever for farmers. \u00a0Many farmers have limited water remaining in their storage reservoirs and little volume left on their annual licensed abstraction so are taking difficult decisions on which crops to irrigate with this precious resource. Many farmers have stopped irrigating fields to save water for harvesting crops. The harvesting of some root crops like potatoes requires water to soften dry hardened soils sufficiently so that crops are not bruised. Farmers are also looking ahead to their water needs for the winter to help establish newly sown and planted crops such as brassicas and cereals and to refill their reservoirs ahead of next year\u2019s irrigation season."

            "text": "It\u2019s not just in the arable sector where water is crucial, livestock farmers are also being affected. Wet fencing to manage livestock on marshland grazing is drying out and abstractors who normally take water from ditches are being asked to stop to ensure the fencing is still effective. With the lack of rain and grass dying off, farmers are already having to feed their animals with winter forage. This means, combined with reduced silage production, they may need to buy in additional forage later in the winter. Milk production is already down. Some support is already available for farmers through such actions as temporarily easing environmental stewardship scheme rules.\u00a0 Support for farmers on dry weather impacts - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)"

            "text": "The Environment Agency is working closely with farmers to support the industry with a package of measures to help access water to safeguard food production and animal welfare without causing harm to the environment. These include options for farmers to access water, with short term actions such as water rights trading between licence holders and adding abstraction points and volumes where the Environment Agency can ensure that the environment and other users will be protected. Where there is a real or imminent threat to crops and livestock, farmers can contact the Environment Agency to discuss availability of water. While numbers of these requests (currently in the low tens) have been relatively few compared to the many thousands of agriculture and irrigation licences, we know that as the dry conditions continue, we will see more farmers come forward for help harvesting crops and refilling their storage reservoirs. \u00a0We are operating our water transfer schemes to help maintain river flows and groundwater levels to support wildlife and facilitate abstraction. The Environment Agency is now actively looking at how they can potentially support farmers accessing water for early refill of winter storage reservoirs. We are also carrying out irrigation patrols and other compliance checks to ensure all abstractors are complying with their licence conditions to help protect water availability."

By making these changes (ideally over the winter period when businesses have potentially more time) farmers are making themselves more resilient to dry weather and the longer-term effects of climate change. Farming Advice Newsletters \u00a0provide useful abstraction reminders and the Farming Advisory Service also publish our irrigation prospects in the spring."
