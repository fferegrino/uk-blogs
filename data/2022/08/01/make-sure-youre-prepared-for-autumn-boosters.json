            "text": "We may be in the midst of summer, record breaking heatwaves and all but, like most care and health professionals, my thoughts inevitably turn to autumn and winter. This is when seasonal viruses make their annual pilgrimage to care homes and clinical settings, now joined by another uninvited guest: coronavirus."

            "text": "Even with the amazingly swift formulation and deployment of effective vaccines, the ever present threat of new, more infectious, variants demands there be no complacency. We must continue rigorous testing, maintain the fully vaccinated status of colleagues and those we care for, and continue to demonstrate the highest standards of infection prevention and control (IPC)."

        {
            "text": "Only such high levels of preparedness can help us maximise the impact of the vaccine programme. Critical to this is the issue of consent forms. It\u2019s so important staff in all care settings make the case for covid vaccine boosters and flu jabs now, making consent from colleagues, residents and others in receipt of care a formality."
        },

Meanwhile, Jenny Firth, Deputy Director of Adult Social Care Operational Resilience at the Department of Health and Social Care, has written to the care sector about the preparations and processes needed for this autumn\u2019s vaccination programme to progress smoothly and at pace."

            "text": "In some ways, it feels still strange, two years later, to still be talking about the pandemic. However, its persistence only spurs our collaborative efforts, and continues to concentrate our minds on the issues of IPC, testing and vaccines."

            "text": "On a related point, our colleagues in NHS England have recently issued their plan for improving long COVID services, a reminder the effects of coronavirus can continue long after initial infections are dealt with."

            "text": "So, whether it\u2019s about protecting against infections in the here and now, or minimising the chances of succumbing to long-covid, gaining consent from those who stand to benefit the most has never been more important. I know you will all do what you can."

Vaccination, the highest standards of IPC and your commitment to protect and support others will continue to see us through good times and bad \u2013 and long may it be so."
