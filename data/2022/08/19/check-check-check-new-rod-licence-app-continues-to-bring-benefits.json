            "text": "The service has the ability to check the angler database on an Enforcement Officer\u2019s behalf. As a group, the officers make hundreds of calls to ICS each month. This is usually to check licence details when an angler cannot locate their licence on the bankside, or if the officer is not satisfied with the licence evidence presented."

One angler who had been shielding was comforted that I didn\u2019t need to be close to check his licence. It makes our work easier and provides a better service to the customer. It\u2019s a great addition to the toolkit. Anything which makes my job better or easier is a good thing.\u201d"
