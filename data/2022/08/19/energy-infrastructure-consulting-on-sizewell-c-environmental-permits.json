In my early career with HMIP I became site inspector for Sizewell B leading our regulation and permitting of the site which was in the final stages of construction and beginning commissioning. It was a hectic time, not least because of the outcome of a then ongoing judicial review for another site (Sellafield) meant that we had to consider \u201cregulatory justification\u201d in our decision making. As now, public consultation was important so we held a further consultation on regulatory justification. After carefully considering all the responses we received in our consultations we issued the \u201cauthorisations\u201d for the site in November 1994 \u2013 around 18 months after we received the applications."

The energy security strategy states an aim that by 2050, up to a quarter of the power used in Great Britain will be from nuclear compared to about 15% today. This equates to 24GWe of generating capacity \u2013 for comparison Sizewell\u00a0C, if built, would provide 3.2GWe \u2013 enough to power about 6 million homes"

Our technical specialists have been scrutinising the applications, asking the company for further information, and carrying out several assessments to help us reach our proposed decision on each application.
