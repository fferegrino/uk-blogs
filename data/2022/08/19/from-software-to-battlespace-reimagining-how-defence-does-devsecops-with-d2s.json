D2S has been launched as part of the Defence Digital Foundry\u2019s aim to accelerate the delivery of common platforms and services to enable data, digital and AI exploration."

            "text": "D2S is a new service that will accelerate the development and deployment of software in Defence. At its core, it will provide developers with a common DevSecOps platform to build and deploy modern software applications across security classifications."

            "text": "The service is not just about a faster way of building the same software that Defence has always delivered. Instead, D2S has the potential to reimagine how Defence will build new kinds of powerful software for our Armed Forces, co-designed with our end users in mind."

It is therefore critical that our DevSecOps capabilities are constantly evolving to allow those on the ground to demand responsive software and gain a competitive advantage on the modern battlefield."

D2S will mark a step change for these teams in Defence."

To achieve this, we knew that we had to truly listen to our users so that, together, we can build D2S into what they need, not what we think they need."

I hope you recognise our response to your pain points, and you can see that we have designed an end-to-end journey that makes sense based on your need for self-service, automation and support."
