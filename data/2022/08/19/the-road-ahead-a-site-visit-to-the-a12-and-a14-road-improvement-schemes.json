We joined the A12 and headed northbound to Junction 25, before heading southbound to Junction 19. The scheme aims to take long-distance traffic off the local roads and put it back on the A12, so that small local roads are not used by drivers who are trying to avoid traffic on larger roads, affecting local villages and their communities.\u00a0"

It took over 14,000 people to build the A14, with a workforce of 2,800 at its peak in summer 2018. The road features slip formed central barriers, channel drainage sections, integral bridges with pre-cast sections built off-site. The scheme also considered aspects of biodiversity, such as burrow pits (large pits in the ground formed while excavating material for construction) turned into wetland features, and the planting of two trees for every tree taken down."

They explained how the use of digital tools drove productivity - for example using up to date construction metrics to drive day to day operational decisions on deployment of machines and materials."
