We have also had some really wonderful finds, including Roman coins, bronze and silver discs and a beautiful necklace made of glass beads."

In addition to developing new skills and learning about the archaeology of the area, the benefits of getting together as a group are massive. Most of us are camping on site and kinship is a big part of what we are doing here. In the evenings, there\u2019s bonding round the campfire and that\u2019s really part of it. Watching the sunsets at the end of the day is good for the soul."

            "text": "The kinship is especially important for the military community. The military is like a family for many and if that is taken away abruptly, if something happens, then that\u2019s a difficult thing. We\u2019ve had soldiers digging with us who\u2019ve been out to Iraq or Afghanistan, who have experienced trauma. We also work closely with the diversity networks to make sure we are representing the whole Army on these exercises and for me that sums up archaeology - it\u2019s all about people. Understanding how they lived, the land they lived on and sharing that experience by how we live on the land today."

[Crown Copyright/MOD 2022]And, looking at this site today, the landscape really hasn\u2019t changed at all. Fundamentally, it looks today as it would have done in the 7th Century. Training doesn\u2019t affect the land. The military presence is really important for these sites, others around the country have been built on or ploughed up, so the military being here has preserved it."

We\u2019ve found a 1400-year-old comb made of deer antler, pieces of Neolithic pots \u2013 around 5000 years old \u2013 even some structures on the site that could be Roman. One of the most interesting finds is a sharpening stone, we haven\u2019t found one of those before!"

[Crown Copyright/MOD 2022]Preserving these sites and properly curating the finds is really important too and this is where DIO are really able to add value to the way the Defence Estates are managed. MOD is assessed by statutory bodies on how we look after our heritage; these assets are inspected regularly to consider their condition. I think we are pretty good custodians, and the statistics seem to back this up. We also want to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of this wonderful history \u2013 all at the same time as making sure that the military achieve their training requirements."

There\u2019s something deep about looking at where we have come from, there\u2019s a connection and this allows us all to experience something bigger than ourselves. Being able to share that on these digs with military personnel who may be having a tough time is highly beneficial."
