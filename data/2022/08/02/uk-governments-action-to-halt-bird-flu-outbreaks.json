We recognise the significant threat that bird flu is posing to seabird populations and it is very distressing to see the impact this is having on these vitally important species."

Our world-leading researchers will help build our understanding in a number of key areas, including why the current virus strains have formed larger and longer outbreaks and understanding transmission and infection in different bird populations."

Equivalent systems have been established in Wales and Scotland, enabling data to be readily compared across the administrations."

There is limited evidence to indicate whether the removal of carcases reduces transmission risk within seabird colonies, given the significant levels of environmental contamination that will remain in the area where carcases have been removed. Removal in these areas should be assessed by land managers on a case-by-case basis with site accessibility and the health protection of those involved in the removal of carcases being a significant consideration in whether to proceed with removal."

Where dead birds are on public land, it is the local authority\u2019s responsibility to arrange disposal of the carcases."
