They will be the difference between whether you achieve them and do the great things you want to do or whether you will fall short and have to rein in your ambitions. Here in Justice Digital, our strategy\u00a0 is going to make a difference to millions of people, from our colleagues across the Ministry of Justice, to users of the many services we provide and this is why it is important that we make Justice Digital a great place to work, where our brilliant people can get on and do brilliant things."

            "text": "Our approach to employee experience and building employee engagement is very much a reflection of our strategic themes as we build flexibility into the organisation by investing in our people with a 10% policy - enabling colleagues to use 10% of their working time to learn new skills, develop and grow with the organisation. We have internal and external apprenticeships and are the only place I have ever worked where you could decide you wanted to do something completely different and be supported in a path to a completely new career. Our Heads of Profession are building communities to share knowledge and experience. Hybrid working is the norm here, with flexible working giving the people the autonomy to get on and do great work! Our National Talent Location Strategy is also helping us to attract the best people in the UK wherever you are."

Our users are our people, all of us,\u00a0 our feedback and employee voice is at the centre of our communications - which are focused on the things people are telling us in their feedback, in this way we can align our communications with what people are talking about, worried about or want to know more about and use their input to form an important component in our decision making and where we put our efforts."
