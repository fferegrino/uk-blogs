In countries where domestic producers have transitioned to less carbon-intensive manufacturing, they might find themselves competing with cheaper, more emissions-intensive, imports from countries that are yet to make this transition. The different costs can therefore affect global competitiveness. Over time, production could relocate to regions with less stringent emissions standards to exploit lower costs. This \u2018carbon leakage\u2019 could thwart efforts to reduce global emissions.\u00a0"

These factors make the potential use of trade remedies contentious, with arguments that developing domestic industries need protection to become cost-competitive over the longer term, countered by arguments that trade remedy measures will increase prices and deter uptake of the green technologies needed to meet climate goals.\u00a0\u00a0"
