To make sure any insights generated were repurposed, we focused the review on the core proposition of data handling and storage and how that would fit into the broader context. This helped build a narrative to maintain the relevance of the work. So when another project team was exploring a similar proposition, they were able to see the connections and reuse any work or design components."

Slides also provide a useful constraint: when presenting, we use fewer words and plain English to help us tell a story. It helps focus on storytelling and gives you the possibility of linking to more detailed information elsewhere while making the core narrative easy to present and share with a whole team.\u00a0"
