Many thousand years before, during \u2018Samudra Manthan\u2019 (the Churning of Oceans), the battle between Dev (demi-Gods) and Danav (demons), took place in the month of Shravan - resulting in 14 different types of rubies being released from the ocean. Of these, 13 were distributed amongst the Devs and Danavs, except Halahal (poison). Lord Shiva drank the poison and stored it in his throat. Hence, the name Neelkantha (\u2018blue throat\u2019) is attributed to Shiva. To reduce the strong effect of poison, Hindus believe that Lord Shiva wore the crescent moon."
