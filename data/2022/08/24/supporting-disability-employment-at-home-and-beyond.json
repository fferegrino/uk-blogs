Having recently received the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures that the UK had met its target of 1 million more disabled people in work, I was excited to showcase the great work sitting behind these statistics."

The UK Government also hosted a side event on increasing disability employment. Alongside myself on the panel was Mike Adams, CEO of Purple, and Jennifer Heigham from the Joint Health and Work Unit. Mike provided a compelling way of thinking about disability employment, centred on making the business case for employers to take on disabled staff, to reflect disabled people in the consumer base. Mike also shared his ambitions of taking his Purple Pound campaign international, launching an American branch later this year."

Indeed, we were really pleased to answer questions demonstrating just this, providing more detail to support other delegates\u2019 work in this space. Questions ranged from asking about how the UK is upskilling disabled people, to issues around people\u2019s confidence in disclosing disability in the workplace."

            "text": "COSP15 served as an opportunity for learning and sharing best practice. I attended a number of bilateral meetings with other delegations. Disability employment remained a strong theme throughout these conversations, and it was both inspiring and affirming to see that other countries are eager to learn from the UK. I also met with Rosemary Kayess, Chair of UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, who noted the added value the UK could bring to the Committee\u2019s Working Group on employment. Through this and other actions we will continue our commitment to improve employment prospects for disabled people."

This belief is reflected domestically and internationally. That is why the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\u2019s (FCDO) \u2018Disability Inclusion and Rights Strategy\u2019 - published earlier this year and launched at the Global Disability Summit 2022 - includes an explicit commitment to continuing to develop our work on inclusive employment."

A UK delegate representative from the FCDO joined non-governmental organisations and disability movement partners in speaking at a COSP15 side event on this topic. He reflected on the fact that article 27 of the CRPD is clear - disabled people have a right not only to work, but to be able to access the job market on an equal basis with others."

This was our manifesto commitment originally set in 2017 to break down barriers for disabled people and those with health conditions and to build more diverse and inclusive workforces."

Our Health and Disability White Paper will help disabled people to live more independently, including with more help to move into work, where work is right for the individual. It will set out our plans to ensure the benefits system better meets the needs of disabled people now and in the future, informed by the huge amounts of feedback we received on the Green Paper. It will also detail plans of where this investment will be spent."

I am excited at the wealth of opportunity we have to continue to help people into work, change lives, and build a society that benefits all."
