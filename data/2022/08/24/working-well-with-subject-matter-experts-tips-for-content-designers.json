I\u2019ve worked for lots of organisations in lots of different roles, but good content has always been at their core. In all my roles, I\u2019ve had the privilege of helping brilliant people to get their ideas onto paper (well, mainly onto websites). Most recently, I\u2019ve been commissioning and editing posts from my fellow User Centred Design colleagues here at Defra to share how we work."

I then moved to the Guardian, where my job was to commission and edit articles from experts in global development and human rights. I had a Masters in Human Rights, so some of it was familiar, but a lot of it was really new to me."
        },
        {
            "text": "I think that made me a better editor, because I had to ask the same questions that a lot of readers might need to ask. I also had to edit the content so that non-experts could understand it."

As Head of Content at the Open Data Institute, I had a lot of fun leading a team to produce creative content - from strategy documents to animations, poems to taxidermy cats - broadly about how data can be stewarded fairly to benefit citizens and society. I've also had the privilege of interviewing a lot of experts for panel discussions."

Include your process and likely timeframes. It's also a good opportunity to ask any questions you have about their role, as you might learn something you didn't know before."

For example, one person told me that there might be a tricky stakeholder who throws a spanner in the works later down the line. This was great to know about early on, so I could allow for delay in my review timings. It also helped me to have realistic expectations of what my direct SME colleague did and didn\u2019t have in their control."
