We moved into \u2018delivery mode\u2019 last year, covered in our last blog. Now we\u2019re looking at what happened through the last planting season, and our preparations for the next."

            "text": "Last winter saw some of the worst storms in recent times damage the England treescape. We worked closely with our Scottish counter parts to lead a joint response in the North of England and that recovery work is ongoing. It was a reminder of how important it is to plant the right trees, in the right places, with good woodland design and management helping them to be resilient to different threats. It also brings home the scale of the challenge we have, as the proposed net Tree Cover Target means we must make sure we\u2019re protecting our existing trees alongside planting new ones."

            "text": "The impacts of the winter storms placed pressure on the skilled foresters and contractors who deal with fallen trees as well as planting new ones. The Tree Programme Sector Capacity and Skills project aims to grow the number of people with these skills, as well as the trees they will plant and manage, and has been a big focus over the last few months."

And more recently, the \u00a38 million Woodland Creation Accelerator Fund invited Local Authorities across England to bid for investment in new tree specialists to help enable them to fulfil widespread commitments to tree planting up and down the country."

The Woods into Management Forestry Innovation Funds and the Tree Production Innovation Fund will award up to \u00a34.5 million to help futureproof trees and forests against impacts of pests, disease and climate change."

            "text": "April saw the fifth auction of the Woodland Carbon Guarantee, quickly followed with \u00a310 million being made available for farmers and land managers to create new woodland to help tackle the effects of climate change. This is a key part of woodland creation, giving landowners creating woodlands agreements that government will buy carbon units if the market does not offer a higher price."

A cornerstone of the Environment Act, more than a million acres of trees will be planted in England by 2050 under the proposed legally binding tree targets. This will cement the long-term commitment to tree planting and establishment."

            "text": "April\u2019s Biosecure Procurement Pilot launch was a step forwards in ensuring that plant health management standards are in place for nurseries supplying trees for the England Woodland Creation Offer and Tree Health Pilot restocking grants. When you know that ash dieback will kill up to 100 million trees, costing the economy up to \u00a315bn over the coming decades, it\u2019s a stark reminder of how important these efforts are. It also highlights how central tree supply is to fulfilling tree planting ambitions."

The grant will enable suppliers to bolster production at pace and has been designed to complement the innovation outputs of the Tree Production Innovation Fund (reopened in March), which provides support for research and development projects that will enhance UK tree production methods and has funded 16 projects to date."

It states Government\u2019s commitment to evaluate the threats facing these habitats and sets out England\u2019s updated principles and objectives to protect and improve these precious habitats for future generations."

We recently announced that The England Woodland Creation Offer will become part of the Local Nature Recovery scheme \u2013 one of the new environmental land management (ELM) schemes \u2013 from 2025. We urge landowners and land managers to apply for a share of \u00a325 million in funding to support woodland creation and tree planting."

We\u2019re starting to see the results, with June\u2019s official planting statistics showing an uplift in planting in 2021/22. There\u2019s a long way to go, and we\u2019re learning and improving all the time. As we head towards the next planting season, we\u2019re more focused than ever in getting trees in the ground and making a real difference in bringing tree planting and woodland cover in England up to our targets."
