That is why we have invested \u00a31.5 billion in a tutoring revolution so every child and young person who needs help catching up can access high-quality tutoring through the National Tutoring Programme, which supports schools by providing access to high-quality tutoring to help pupils whose education has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. We\u2019ve seen more than 2million course starts through the National Tutoring Programme since 2020, with over 1.7m starts this academic year in around 80% of schools."

These initiatives sit alongside alongside other evidence-based approaches and activities funded by sustained recovery premium funding, which is set to nearly double in secondary schools from September 2022 from \u00a3145 to \u00a3276 per eligible pupil. In addition, from September 2022, every student in 16-19 provision will benefit from around 40 extra hours per year of teaching and learning."
