Our service team has taken a user-centred approach to designing the service, carrying out continuous user research to ensure that the service meets the needs of its users. This has allowed us to expand the service to allow for producers and exporters to apply for a Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate Certificate of Conformity alongside a phytosanitary certificate where required."
