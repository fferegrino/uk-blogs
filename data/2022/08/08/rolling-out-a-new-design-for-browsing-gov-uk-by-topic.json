This is a set of pages on GOV.UK designed to help users find the right service or bit of guidance for their needs. By improving this navigation, our aim is to make it easier for the millions of people who use GOV.UK every day to find the essential information and services they need."

            "text": "For example, topic-browse allows users to see the range of Childcare and parenting support available to them. The user can then narrow this down based on their immediate needs, for instance, to specific guidance around Pregnancy and birth. On that page the user can find short manageable lists relating to specific tasks, such as \u2018Working and time off when you're having a baby\u2019."

            "text": "While some users will use search to find information like this, we know that many users on GOV.UK prefer to browse through the site, particularly if they are unfamiliar with a topic, don\u2019t know what to search for, or want to see everything available to them."

        {
            "text": "To make improvements to the topic pages we first ran in-depth research with small groups of users, followed by a large-scale test on GOV.UK to measure impact. Following our analysis of the test results, we rolled out the new design to all GOV.UK users last week."

We tracked a range of other metrics which might indicate a knock-on effect of the new design and saw no indication of problems."

            "text": "The new page design also improves accessibility, simplifying the experience for users of screen readers and people who magnify the page. The new design also significantly increases the size of touch targets, the area of the page you need to tap to follow a link. We\u2019ve seen this improve the overall mobile experience, especially on smaller phone screens, and can be particularly helpful for people with a tremor or motor impairment."

            "text": "There was one user behaviour we noticed that gave us some pause. Specifically on mobile, users are opening the expanding sections at a lower rate than on desktop, and at a lower rate than we expected. So we\u2019re going to factor an investigation of this into our rollout."
