Gathering and understanding user needs allows analysts to create code which is fit for purpose. Frequent conversations with users, and showing them working versions of the product, help us understand if needs have changed so we can adjust our code appropriately. Opening these lines of communication between analysts and users is vital to allow for RAP to work effectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
