A key part of this is ensuring that they can achieve this both inside and outside the classroom and the HAF programme is vital in enabling schools to provide essential support to pupils and their families outside of term time."

Over the school holidays, and especially during the summer, not having access to school support can be detrimental to parents and carers who may otherwise feel as if they have nowhere else to turn."

            "text": "HAF provides parents with a point of contact during holiday periods that is vital for accessing support and services. This is particularly important this year, with some of our families facing a wide range of challenges. For example, many of our schools have created family support rooms for any parent or carer to utilise, which were introduced as a 'home away from home' for pupils and parents to access support, resources and advice."

Different aspects of the HAF programme will be more impactful and helpful for certain communities than others."

        {
            "text": "For example, families based in large cities may struggle to provide their children with access to safe green spaces to exercise and enjoy fresh air. Schools can use the HAF programme to offer free outdoor and safe activities that will support a child\u2019s physical and mental health. On the other hand, families in rural locations for example, may instead require support for children to socialise during the holidays and HAF clubs can also meet these needs."

For example, last Christmas, we partnered with a range of local businesses that enabled us to provide families with healthy and locally sourced produce, which has encouraged them to think more about the food they eat. We would encourage other HAF providers to consider similar partnerships for any future delivery periods."
