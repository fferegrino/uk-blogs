            "text": "As mentioned previously, the jQuery library was only 32 Kb of compressed and minified (when white space removed from code and repeated words substituted) JavaScript. Now I know what you may be thinking, that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot of data, especially compared to images which can be multiple megabytes in size. But when it\u2019s on every page, from a web performance perspective, it equates to a lot of data. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that there\u2019s a big difference between image data and compressed JavaScript data. Browsers and devices handle the 2 data types very differently."
        },
        {
            "text": "JavaScript is known as a \u201crender-blocking\u201d resource. This means when a browser encounters JavaScript it goes through a multistep process which involves it being downloaded, then uncompressed, before it\u2019s finally parsed and executed. This all happens within a device's available Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory. These tasks can be very slow and energy intensive depending on the device and connection."
        },
        {
            "text": "Unfortunately, during this time, the actual drawing of pixels to the device's screen has to be paused until the execution of the JavaScript is completed. Upon completion the browser can then continue to paint pixels for the rest of the page."
        },
        {
            "text": "Images and image data aren't \u201crender-blocking\u201d, meaning parts of the webpage can be painted to the page while additional image data is being downloaded in parallel. Therefore, a 32 Kb image has much less of a performance impact than 32 Kb of compressed JavaScript. This is especially true for users on low specification devices that are generally slower, older and less expensive."

Last October, Ofcom estimated 2 million households were \"experiencing affordability issues with either their fixed broadband and/or smartphone\", so our work here has the potential to reduce their internet costs."

            "text": "At this point, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the anonymous Real User Monitoring (RUM) data we collect from user devices shows that GOV.UK is already a very quick website. For the majority of users, the site loads in less than 1 second. But the distribution graph (seen above) also shows that there are some users that see a page load time of up to 2.35 seconds. Examining these users\u2019 RUM performance data more closely, we see:"

As the graph above shows, the time it took for the page to completely draw the pixels to the screen (visually complete) dropped from 11.3 seconds to 9.4 seconds (a 17% improvement)."
