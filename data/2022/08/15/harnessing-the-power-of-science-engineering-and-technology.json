And to secure economic growth, we need to apply innovation to all aspects of productivity. We will be helped by many yet immature industries, such as those coming from the application of quantum computing or engineering biology. And we will need to get the right skills in place.\u00a0"

CST\u2019s advice needs to focus on what government can do to encourage a range of actors to deliver."

It can only be a good thing for officials to see how things work in business, and for those who work in industry to better understand the constraints of implementing policy. We tried this with some success during my time at BP. There are lots of arrangements around career path management, compensation and pensions which need sorting out to make this work. And why stop with just this; it would be a great step to include more expertise from academia."
