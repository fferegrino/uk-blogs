Improving funding, so that health and care are on a sustainable footing, training professionals to have the right skills and behaviours and making sure we have enough good people to meet the health and care needs of an ageing population \u2013 all these are pressing issues."

            "text": "Standards can help improve information sharing and support health and care professionals to spot early warning signs of deteriorating health, whether at home, in care homed or in other care settings. That should trigger a care planning update and possibly a change or increase in the care someone receives. If we can get that right we could avoid unnecessary or preventable hospital admissions and improve people's health and wellbeing."
