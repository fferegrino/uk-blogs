            "text": "On Tuesday 6 December, we held our 7th annual Code Challenge, with even more opportunities for pupils of all ages to take part. Sian Lloyd, news presenter, hosted the event which was streamed live to children across Wales. Last year, we ran a fully remote event that was streamed live on Microsoft Teams. With the removal of restrictions this year, I was thrilled to see the return of our in-person DVLA Code Challenge at the Richard Ley Development Centre (RLDC) in Swansea, which was bigger and better than ever. Over 300 school children and teachers from across Wales joined us for the live final, with even more taking part through a live stream."

This was now each school\u2019s opportunity to showcase the results of all their hard work and efforts to their fellow competitors, the judges and to those streaming from locations across Wales."

We listened as students gave insight into how they coded them, using online tools such as \u2018Scratch\u2019. We also got to see a live demonstration of every game. It was great to see young people using the skills needed to think like coders, and you could really see their sense of pride after receiving a long-lasting round of applause from the audience."
