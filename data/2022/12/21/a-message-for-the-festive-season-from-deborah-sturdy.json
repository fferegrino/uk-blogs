The launch, this year, of the first leadership programme for ethnic minority social care nurses is a confident case in point. I am looking forward to sharing colleagues\u2019 stories as they begin this exciting journey. True leadership must be representative of all of us and I believe this programme will help us achieve that goal."

            "text": "Effective leadership is also about showing others what works and having the evidence to prove it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been so gratifying to see the progress made in the last 12 months to develop a strong social care research base. We are experts in care, voices of positive professional challenge, but the more we can back up our frontline experiences with data, the more influence we can bring to bear in wider decisions about care and support."

            "text": "In the same spirit, the recent invitation to social care nurses to become chairs of the new shared decision-making councils in every Integrated Care Board (ICB) in England is another exciting demonstration of the growing visibility and esteem of our profession."

Meanwhile, it\u2019s been an honour to present many more gold and silver Chief Nurse for Adult Social Care Awards to colleagues across a variety of care settings and in a wide range of roles."

Thanks again for your hard work, dedication and commitment to the very highest standards of care."
