This brings the total value of fishing opportunities secured for the UK fleet in 2023 in the three main negotiation forums to \u00a3750 million, a \u00a334 million increase from last year."

The UK has also secured catch limits worth a further \u00a3256m with the North East Atlantic coastal States, while an agreement with Norway last month will see the UK fishing industry benefit from fishing opportunities worth \u00a35 million in 2023."

Wherever possible, catch levels have been set in line with, or lower than, the level advised by scientists at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), and there is an estimated 13% increase in catch levels that align with ICES advice compared to last year."
