We put service users at the heart of what we do but we also understand this can be a stressful time for families and carers in particular."

It is part of a commitment to involve carers in the \u201cTriangle of Care\u201d whereby carers, service users and staff work collaboratively to promote recovery and wellbeing. Carers and the essential role they play will be identified at first contact with services or as soon as possible after and staff will be trained to engage with carers more effectively."

Carers should be involved with staff to devise care plans for their loved one and across the board, staff are making a commitment to share information with carers in a timely manner. That is why it is so important we are introducing a way for carers to readily identify themselves to staff."

            "text": "We also recently launched our Carers Network, a new initiative aimed at offering an increased level of support to carers involved with Cygnet\u2019s national services. Through the network, carers will be able to access practical support and advice from Cygnet professionals on the management and support of people with a learning disability and behaviour that challenges, as well as on managing their own health and wellbeing. Carers will also be able to help shape the design and improvement of Cygnet services."

In the long-term, we hope the network can also contribute to the wider debate on the future of mental health care, so that it effects real change for those carers looking after an adult with an enduring mental health condition or learning difficulty."
