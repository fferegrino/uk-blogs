While some have juggled a series of complex briefs across government, others were relative novices. Few, like Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, have had the intelligence apprenticeship they need."

They also receive the Weekly Survey of Intelligence, or \u2018Red Book\u2019, from the assessment body, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), with secret material from SIS, MI5 and GCHQ provided by alternative means."

While there are gaps, released files do allow an insight into Margaret Thatcher\u2019s visits to the UK intelligence machinery. After Churchill, she comes a close second for her passion for the secret world. One senior official recalled, \u2018Mrs Thatcher was a devotee of intelligence. She liked it, she respected it she believed it gave her the truth\u2019."

Then committee chair, Antony Acland, noted that the JIC was \u2018gratified and encouraged by the Prime Minister\u2019s interest in intelligence, and her attendance at this meeting would be a stimulus to its work\u2019.\u00a0 Thatcher herself later acknowledged the importance of the visit. \u201cI found the occasion both thoroughly enjoyable in its own right and of value in the longer term\u201d, she wrote to Acland: \"The work of the Committee is of considerable importance.\""

            "text": "The visit to the JIC was just the beginning. On 10 April 1980, Margaret Thatcher also became the first Prime Minister since Churchill to visit the UK\u2019s signals intelligence agency. Arriving at GCHQ\u2019s Oakley site in Cheltenham, she began the visit by being briefed on GCHQ\u2019s work by its Director, Sir Brian Tovey. The visit was broken down into 3 sessions.[1] The first focused on non-Soviet Bloc collection and the work of GCHQ\u2019s K Division. Other topics included cryptanalysis, translation, traffic analysis, and the distribution of reporting, followed by lunch with the GCHQ Directorate. Michael Herman, then Head of J Division (Soviet Bloc Production area), ran a second session on Soviet Bloc traffic, with the third, and final, session led by GCHQ\u2019s Chief Scientist Ralph Benjamin. It was in the final briefing that Thatcher was told for the first time about Zircon, GCHQ\u2019s ill-fated top-secret satellite project, later cancelled due to rising costs."

In a letter to senior staff, Tovey reflected that \u2018the visit was an outstanding success which can only reflect credit upon GCHQ as a whole. My warmest congratulations to you all.\u2019"

Writing to the Prime Minister\u2019s private secretary, Armstrong wrote there was \u2018an element of \u2018keeping up with the Joneses\u2019 about this\u2019, citing an earlier (and undated) visit by Mrs Thatcher to MI5, yet suggested the trip would be \u2018interesting and useful\u2019."

I would therefore like to take this opportunity of saying a word of thanks to all members of your service. I know that a great deal of their work goes unrecognised and unsung. In the nature of things, very few people can know the full extent of their contribution to preserving our liberty and helping others secure theirs. I should like all members of the service to know that they have my full support and my warm appreciation of their work."

            "text": "Margaret Thatcher\u2019s understanding of intelligence went far beyond her reading of reports. Visits to the intelligence agencies were part of a wider effort to develop understanding of departments, personalities and processes, and a valuable opportunity for the Prime Minister to show her appreciation of the intelligence she received. For the agencies, showing the Prime Minister what they did was vital and part of an effort to maintain budgets. Mrs Thatcher\u2019s determined support for Zircon in the face of wider opposition on cost grounds is testament to her advocacy of intelligence, something perhaps reinforced by her visits. With a new Prime Minister, the need for close intelligence-policy relations is important, and visits can be important in cementing the bond with the occupants of Number 10."
