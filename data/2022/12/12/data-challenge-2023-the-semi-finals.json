To quote Steve Jobs, innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity - not a threat. We know that government has a vast array of data assets, but can often fail to make best use of them.\u00a0"

Run by the NTT DATA UK, the Cabinet Office, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Global Government Forum the Challenge seeks ideas from civil servants, across the whole of government, on how government can improve its use of data \u2013 and volunteers to work with senior leaders and technical specialists on taking forward the best ideas. Data Challenge\u2019s winning idea will receive \u00a350,000 cash funding, as well as both technical advice and development support from NTT DATA UK, and the backing of top Civil Servants to bring the idea to life."
