At Eythrope on the Waddesdon Estate and on Manor Farm in Chearsley, the transformation has given multiple benefits, including flourishing wildlife, flood prevention, nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience."

It was made possible by working\u00a0with the\u202fFreshwater Habitats Trust, Waddesdon Estate, Aylesbury Vale District Council, Thames Water and the Environment Agency. This restoration project was the first of its kind in the River Thame catchment and was the largest construction project the Trust had ever undertaken."

            "text": "Initially, the groundwork involved stripping off topsoil from the entire area (11,300m2) right down to the underlying clay. This might seem extreme, but stripping the topsoil removes built-up nutrients (pollutants) in the soil left over from past use of fertilizer, and ensures good water quality for the wetland.\u202fAt the peak of the dig, we had\u202ffour\u202f22-tonne dump trucks, a bulldozer and\u202ftwo\u202fexcavators (22 tonne and 13 tonne) working constantly.\u202f It was quite a\u202fsight\u202fto behold!"

            "text": "At both Eythrope and later at Manor Farm, we wanted to incorporate a new backwater as part of the wetland creation. This is basically a large pool connected to the river channel which benefits the local fish populations. Backwaters like these occur naturally; however, many have been lost due to people modifying rivers. Constructing backwaters returns to the landscape important nursery grounds for young fish and refuges for adult fish. At the Eythrope Wetland, fish\u202fwere seen in the backwater the next day \u2013 build it and they will come!"

The landowner, local organic farmer Rose Dale, who is a member of the Thame Valley Farmer Cluster that the Trust facilitates, said: \u201cThe wetland project is a wonderful way to restore this landscape to a flourishing natural state. Since converting to an organic farm business, I have already seen exciting signs of life return to the farm and look forward to how this project will create further habitat for plants and wildlife.\u201d"

There has not yet been time for plants to take hold or winter floods to have an impact at Manor Farm, but our monitoring at Eythrope shows that the wetland there holds river water from flooding\u202fand also\u202ffills with low-nutrient rainwater during the year.\u202fIn this context, nutrients are pollutants from past fertilizer use, so low-nutrient rainwater is important\u202fto encourage\u202fcolonization by\u202fpollution-sensitive plants and invertebrates.\u202fI am pleased to say the\u202fponds successfully held water even in prolonged dry weather."
