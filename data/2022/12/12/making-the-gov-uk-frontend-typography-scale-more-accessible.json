By making these changes to our typography scale, service teams will not have to spend time on adjustments to make sure it\u2019s accessible for their users. The changes will also make it easier for service teams to use best practices such as avoiding fonts that are too small using GOV.UK Frontend.\u00a0"

            "text": "We\u2019re also updating the size of our typography classes. Our typography class suffixes, sometimes known as \u2018t-shirt\u2019 sizes, are the letters that appear at the end of our classes to signify the text size the class will apply to an HTML element. For example, users can use \u2018govuk-body\u2019 to get the standard body text styling, the classes \u2018govuk-body-l\u2019 for larger text and \u2018govuk-body-s\u2019 for smaller text. The issue we\u2019ve identified is with size consistency. Different typography CSS classes will produce different text sizes when using the same suffix. For example, \u2018govuk-heading-l\u2019 is a different size to \u2018govuk-body-l\u2019.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "To solve this problem, we will be aligning our typography class suffixes to produce the same sizes regardless of class prefixes. Ensuring that our class suffixes are aligned will mean that all our typography classes will reliably have the same size on the typography scale associated with the same semantic suffix. For example, headings, legends and labels will all display typography scale value 36 when they use the \u201cl\u201d suffix. This will make our typography classes more consistent and therefore easier to use."

One GOV.UK Frontend release will include the changes to font scale and alignment of semantic suffixes in GOV.UK. Another release will include the removal of 14. We expect these releases to be ready across 2023."
