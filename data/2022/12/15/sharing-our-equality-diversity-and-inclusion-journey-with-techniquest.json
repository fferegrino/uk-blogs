Allowing our colleagues to be their \u2018whole and brilliant selves\u2019 in work is about valuing what\u2019s below the waterline as well as the \u2018seen\u2019 things above it."

So let me pose a question. If you could do one thing in work that would help people to feel valued, and to help feel safe enough to share those things \u2018below the waterline\u2019, what would it be?"
