            "text": "Public Sector Research Establishments (PSREs) play an important and often under-recognised role in the UK\u2019s science, research, development and innovation landscape, and they are crucial for providing science for policy and operations for government. I have visited many PSREs during my time as Government Chief Scientific Adviser and was delighted to visit the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge site in November."

David set the agency in the wider context of UK One Health, an initiative which considers human health, animal health, agriculture, and environmental sectors holistically. He described how the agency delivers on biosecurity, trade and food safety & security, as well as how it provides science advice to support policy."

The breadth is both impressive and important. A feature of science is that it is always open to challenge, and a broad base of partners ensures that challenge comes from diversity."

            "text": "I particularly enjoyed hearing from some of the UK\u2019s leading specialists in animal health, ranging from avian flu through to tuberculosis (TB) to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). APHA has access to deep expertise and has developed the capability to adapt and respond to emerging animal health risks."

            "text": "My visit marked the start of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2022, so it was timely that part of our tour included a presentation from APHA scientist, Muna Anjum, on the work ongoing at APHA on AMR. AMR is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development, which cannot be managed effectively without considering the health outcomes of humans, animals and the environment together."

            "text": "Of course, it was also timely to hear about APHA\u2019s efforts to tackle the ongoing outbreak of avian influenza. It was an opportunity to discuss how to ensure that we have the broadest scientific input to help understand the outbreak trajectory and potential mitigation. \u00a0 \u202f\u00a0"

The\u00a0investment and redevelopment of these facilities is essential and will ensure that this site continues to be crucial in protecting the UK from animal disease and future outbreaks.\u00a0 "
