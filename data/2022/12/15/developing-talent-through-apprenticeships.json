We solve problems. We identify, analyse and look to understand different aspects of an organisation: its people, processes, information, and technology to ensure outcomes meet the needs of the business and its users."

            "text": "Although the BA apprenticeship officially begins in January 2023, we wanted them to be familiar with an environment that is significantly different to where they\u2019ve worked previously. So in October we placed these intrepid BA apprentices into product teams and assigned them each a mentor from within the HMPPS Digital BA team. They have settled in quickly, tackling problems and learning how we work in Justice Digital."

Starting early means they have had time to learn our tooling and technologies which wouldn't be possible if they were studying and building their portfolio as the apprenticeship begins in earnest. It also meant we could iron out any teething problems with accounts, transfers and devices."

To help ensure this I regularly review what our objectives are over the spending review periods and forecast the number of BAs that we will need.
