            "text": "Records \u2013 and the way in which the information they contain is captured \u2013 have evolved over time. Their use has become more complex, sometimes representing an account of an entire previous era.\u00a0 There are many examples: in the early middle ages, the Venerable Bede used archived records from a range of sources to write his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. In 1086, William the Conqueror created the first record of all the land, livestock and property in England when he commissioned the Domesday Book [below]. This is a powerful record \u2013 one that still shapes land ownership in Britain a thousand years later."

In today\u2019s Civil Service we usually create records digitally, but despite the change in medium records continue to be important evidence of events, transactions or decisions.\u00a0"

Some of these records \u2013 particularly those that capture important events or decisions that shape the government\u2019s interaction with society \u2013 will be selected for, transferred to, and preserved at The National Archives at Kew. These can then be accessed and used at any time for research."

For instance, this can be when a record is required to protect the department\u2019s reputation, or when a record\u2019s ongoing existence is a compliance issue because it contains obsolete or incorrect information."
