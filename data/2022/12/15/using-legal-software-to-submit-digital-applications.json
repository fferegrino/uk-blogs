This means you can submit your applications through our portal using the Digital Registration Service, or by using legal software connected to our systems. We know many customers are starting to use this kind of legal software (we\u2019ve seen an increase of around 20% this year) so now is a good time to look at why.\u00a0"

APIs are essentially digital interfaces which legal software developers can \u2018plug into\u2019. This means you can submit applications or use other HM Land Registry services using a legal software provider, within your own case management system or through a direct integration with our system if your IT team can build that connection. We already see hundreds of thousands of digital applications come to us from customers using legal software connected to our APIs \u2013 over a third of our applications are submitted via this route.\u00a0"
