But how do we increase take-up among unpaid carers, a critical and highly valued group of people, whose care is worth the equivalent to a second NHS, and without whom health and care services would collapse? By protecting unpaid carers we, in turn, help protect our health and care services."

Rather than being called, carers who are not identified on their patient record can self-identify and book themselves centrally for a COVID-19 vaccination. This was not available for most of the pandemic. These key differences mean we need to approach identifying carers in different ways."

            "text": "Organisations, including Carers UK, are trying to do two things. The first is to identify unpaid carers who won\u2019t be called for a COVID-19 or flu jab. This essentially means targeting unpaid carers under 50 years old and encouraging them to book their vaccinations. Secondly, we\u2019re trying to encourage the people who have been offered the jab directly to take it up."

            "text": "Getting vaccinated means a lot to unpaid carers. Last autumn, according to Carers UK\u2019s survey, the booster round had good take-up, with around 47% being offered because they were unpaid carers and not because of age or an underlying condition. Last year, only 4% said they were not having their COVID-19 vaccinations. Hesitancy was higher among unpaid carers from ethnic minority communities, but only slightly higher."

            "text": "Overall, there were very positive attitudes to vaccination.\u00a0 When we look at the free flu jab for unpaid carers, it is a very popular measure, but take-up rates pre-pandemic were far lower than older age groups \u2013 around 55% for carers who were younger."

            "text": "This important learning from flu jabs pre-pandemic points towards some really positive public health policy in relation to unpaid carers \u2013 offering vaccinations to people over the age of 50 will capture a good cohort since the peak age of caring is between 50 and 64."
        },
        {
            "text": "Getting unpaid carers to take up the offer is sometimes challenging. Unpaid carers can be very time poor, if they are providing substantial care (e.g. 20 hours plus per week), or if they have children and are stretched between two generations and they often say they are worn out. It\u2019s not hard to see how fitting a jab into this busy packed schedule might be more difficult for an unpaid carer. That makes it essential we communicate how accessible, easy and convenient vaccination appointments can be."
