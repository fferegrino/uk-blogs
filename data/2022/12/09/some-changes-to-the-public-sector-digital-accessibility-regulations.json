The UK no longer receives changes to regulations made in the EU, such as changing the version of the technical standard."

            "text": "The technical standard for the regulations in the UK is now the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, to level AA. These are published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Previously the standard was EN 301 549, which took the WCAG standard and made minor amendments to it, mainly about mobile app accessibility. WCAG is far more well known and used in the industry, and our guidance about meeting the regulations has always referenced WCAG 2.1. We believe if there are any changes needed in WCAG for mobile apps, they should be made through the W3C\u2019s open standards process for all rather than creating another standard."
