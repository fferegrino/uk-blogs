            "text": "Many have dispersed digital estates spanning various policy units and arms length bodies. Their online services are various and comprise platforms for, say, registering your pet ferret or registering a boat, (alright not the first government services that spring to mind but certainly robust public-facing, transactional services like any other) and for more specialist staff-facing service types like HR and finance platforms, recruitment tools, informational websites, survey and collaboration tools. These are usually owned and updated by third party providers who exercise tight control over service functionality and have a wider obligation to a cross-sector, often multinational client base with differing goals towards accessibility standards."

            "text": "For UK public bodies, making their various user interfaces accessible to a consistently recognisable standard is a work in progress and the progress is slow without proper resource, desire for change and incentive to think in terms of the whole system. Given how the accessibility regulations will be monitored and enforced, there is, after all, significant risk of sanction and risk to reputation for organisations if just one of its multiple services persistently excludes users or is unresponsive to meeting the obligation towards making reasonable adjustments.\u00a0"

This goes for citizen-facing as well as staff-facing services."

We therefore initiated a competitive exercise to find an accessibility auditor to partner with. We found the Digital Accessibility Centre Ltd (DAC), a non-profit social enterprise long accustomed to working with public bodies. DAC are equipped with talented personnel with a range of skills and attributes. They include quality assurance testers all of whom have first hand experience of the barriers an inaccessible website places between them and independence.\u00a0"

They audit services for barriers affecting the range of visual, hearing, mobility and cognitive disabilities, they test on different browser formats and screen sizes and they can test the more specialist stuff too; locked down administrative or backend interfaces. All to make sure that services are good enough to receive the DAC accreditation logo. DAC\u2019s Director, Cam Nicholl, says, \u201cit is heartening to see such commitment to digital inclusion and DAC are delighted to have been chosen to work alongside Cabinet Office digital teams to help make sure their services are accessible to everyone.\u201d DAC is a Living Wage Foundation accredited employer and so Cam also sees another plus in their being able to \u201cgrow and provide valuable employment opportunities for disabled people\u201d.\u00a0"

This includes publishing a regularly updated accessibility statement, one which meets the required format, covers the mandatory wording on enforcement, lists known outstanding accessibility barriers and is useful to users in so far as the contact details provided are not bogus (an astonishing 20 per cent of them reportedly are!) ."

This mid-range equates to the European digital accessibility standard EN 301 549 or level AA of the latest version of the international standard, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Yet, as reasonable as this set goal sounds, the national monitoring body in their inaugural report notes that the average number of high level accessibility barriers (WCAG level A or AA rated) encountered per public sector website is 52 per website and 2 per web page.\u00a0"

This partnership provides a cost effective way of raising service standards across the organisation by taking away the need for individual service teams to procure separate external audits; all from different suppliers of varying quality and pricing. We know that this work will help us to provide digitally inclusive services for all. Working with DAC will allow the Cabinet Office to assure digital accessibility to the highest standards and help us strive towards being the exemplar at the heart of government.\u00a0"
