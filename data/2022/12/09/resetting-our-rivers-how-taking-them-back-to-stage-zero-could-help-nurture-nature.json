Here, he explains how he\u2019s working to restore the glory of local rivers by resetting them to their natural state, and how this will support nature recovery as the world discusses biodiversity at COP15."

Down at the bottom of the valley this grass blends with the wetter landscape\u2019s lush luminous green of wetland vegetation interspersed with sparkling pools of water."

            "text": "Heading down the slope towards the tangled mix of woodland and open pasture, the temperature drops and the sound of cool running water burbles as it cascades over fallen tree limbs and winds its way across a tangled and untidy landscape of open woodland and grassland. The trees\u2019 bark and roots are covered in bright, textured moss and ferns and between them are glades where beavers and deer graze, keeping the vegetation in check and allowing the light to filter through."

In ancient times, it would have been a source of clean water, food, and building material, but also would have served as places where our ancestors communed with nature, believing the river to be inhabited by ancient goddesses."

It has been subjected to generations of interventions to drain the land so it\u2019s suitable for arable use, like much of Lincolnshire\u2019s lost wetlands."

            "text": "River restoration is nothing new \u2013 it helps us improve habitats, increase biodiversity, manage flood risk and protect water quality and quantity during periods of drought. Often it\u2019s done by re-wiggling the rivers, removing bunds, lowering the floodplain to encourage spillage, or creating meanders that more closely resemble the courses they would have naturally taken."

            "text": "But a stage zero reset goes a step further, allowing it to choose its own shape, and be untidy but free. This technique was developed in the Northwest United States and there has been a growing movement to apply it in the UK across specially-selected sites like Holnicote in Devon and other sites in Cumbria, Norfolk and Lincolnshire."
        },
        {
            "text": "On the River Witham, we \u2018lifted\u2019 the water up onto the landscape by cutting new channels in the floodplain and filling the old, deeper channel. This raised the water table, reduced drainage (giving the river more water to work with), and allows it to reform through its own natural processes of erosion and deposition. Scattering fallen trees across the floodplain mimics processes that would happen naturally over time as the landscape evolves and the river forms its own riffles, rivulets, pools and bogs without human intervention."

        {
            "text": "This is what we\u2019ve done on the River Witham upstream Grantham in Lincolnshire, and it brings multiple benefits for people and nature. This wet land acts like a sponge, encouraging water to spill out onto the floodplain during wet periods and releasing water back into the river when it\u2019s dry, supporting wildlife and wetland habitat. It also traps nutrients and fine sediment, resulting in cleaner river water downstream. And the project will also absorb 117 tonnes of carbon emissions, meaning that it\u2019s helping tackle both the climate and the nature emergencies."

            "text": "Nature has been quick to recolonise the new habitat of pied wagtails, egrets, herons and wildfowl returning just days after the work was complete. And after heavy rain, we can see the water downstream of the site has colour than the water flowing into it, which shows us that the fine silts and sands are dropping out into the wetland as we hoped."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s more important now than ever before that we look to make a step change in how we manage and improve the environment to halt the decline and support nature recovery. This must include embracing the potential for nature-based solutions delivering for nature and our wider environmental and societal objectives."

And as the world prepares for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity this week \u2013 COP 15 \u2013 this stage zero restoration project is a solid example of how we can restore our rivers to their former glory and achieve multiple outcomes through the process."
