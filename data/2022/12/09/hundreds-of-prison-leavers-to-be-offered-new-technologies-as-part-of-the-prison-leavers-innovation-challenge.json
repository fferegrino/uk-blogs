Two pilots have successfully launched in the community this month, with the potential to support hundreds of prison leavers to resettle into life outside of prison."

You can read more about the first phase here."

Illiteracy is a significant issue amongst the prison population and can be a barrier to navigating life after release. For example, it can impact engagement with education, training and employment\u2013important in reducing reoffending\u2013and make everyday tasks such as finding accommodation or doing grocery shopping more difficult."

It is based on the paper-based \u2018Turning Pages\u2019 learning model which has been developed and delivered by the Shannon Trust in prisons since 2015 with demonstrable impact. Digitising this program provides prison leavers with greater flexibility and on the app, learners can set personal goals\u2013such as learning to read a letter from their family or write a CV. Prison leavers will be supported by a dedicated coach for the duration of the program."

            "text": "Building a positive crime-free identity is a key step in keeping prison leavers on the straight and narrow and tracking success can reinforce positive behaviours. However, if prison leavers are not supported to do this, and their needs are not met, they may struggle to pursue constructive non-criminal goals and are more likely to reoffend. Developing tailored responses matched to prison leavers\u2019 needs and progress can therefore reduce reoffending."

The platform allows prison leavers to input their daily needs, such as housing, employment and addiction, and suggests support services to assist with these\u2013while gamification features will help prison leavers hit their goals. Key practitioners from Include UK, part of the consortium who have developed the app, are also able to identify and mitigate patterns in offending behaviour and barriers to desistance using data generated from the platform."
