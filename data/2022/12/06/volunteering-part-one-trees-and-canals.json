This might sound damaging, but it actually creates a neat hedgerow which provides a habitat for wildlife and stops livestock escaping. As long as you don\u2019t cut all the way through the trunk, the tree will keep growing."

As the nature reserve is partly owned by Natural England, it was an opportunity to see first-hand how important the work we do at Defra is in terms of protecting our natural environment. I\u2019ve done conservation volunteering in the past and really enjoyed it, - it\u2019s such a good way to take a step back and remind ourselves of the impact our work has and the difference we make."

The reserve sees nearly 40,000 birds visiting every winter; from marsh harriers to spotted crake. Staggeringly, some of the birds arrive on the very same day each day - even on a leap year!"
