We wrote about the advantages of a prototyping mindset in 2017, learning lessons from a project at that time on the private rented sector. There has been a huge amount of activity in the public policy design space since then, and the updated Policy Profession Standards now reference \u2018prototypes\u2019 or \u2018prototyping\u2019 in seventeen different places."

Over four months we involved 35 stakeholders in 30+ hours of research and testing. Following initial evidence-gathering, we conducted interviews and a two-part workshop with marine licence applicants from across different industries, including telecoms, energy companies, ports, environmental charities and a local authority. Participants co-created 50+ ideas for how to improve the use and usability of marine plans which they collectively refined down to six, using an adapted version of Policy Lab\u2019s policy canvas. We developed eight high-level design prototypes based on these ideas and insights before testing them with applicants and stakeholders.\u00a0"

For example, we wanted feedback on the concept of using videos to provide information, so we presented hand drawn storyboards to clearly convey the idea but also signal that it was at an early stage of exploration rather than a concrete proposal. Using a more polished prototype with screenshots or a recording might have suggested the idea was further along in development and could have invited feedback on aspects such as video quality, voice of the presenter or other aesthetics, which we were not seeking to test at this stage.\u00a0"

After a few sessions, we could see where feedback and comments indicated a strong level of consensus about an idea - for example whether it solved a problem, it wouldn\u2019t work in practice or it would lead to new issues. We adapted the prototypes when clear feedback or strong suggestions emerged, in order to gather feedback on possible variations. We iterated all prototypes at least twice, sometimes three times, during the course of the testing phase. For example, an industry stakeholder suggested the idea of live workshops when testing the video concept. We built a mock event invite page and agenda into the designs for the next interview later that day."

We used a number of idea generation techniques with stakeholders, including the government styles of action cards and change cards, to generate a diverse set of ideas. These tools led stakeholders to come up with ideas ranging from simple - but important - tweaks to more far-reaching speculations. This was an effective starting point for prototyping. The wide range of ideas also encouraged us to push the boundaries in our subsequent designs. Even if some prototypes were eventually disregarded, feedback on them helped us gain new insights into marine licence applicants\u2019 motivations and fears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

We tried to stay detached from the participants\u2019 feedback. If they didn\u2019t like an idea, our task was to find out why rather than convince them that the idea was a good one.\u00a0"
