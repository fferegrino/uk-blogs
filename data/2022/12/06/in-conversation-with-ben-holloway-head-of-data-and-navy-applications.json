Eighty people from the RAF, Army, Navy, Reserves and Civil Service worked together in cross-functional teams throughout the week to find solutions to MOD-wide problem sets."

            "text": "Enabled by Astra and delivered by Appivate, Digital Academy and Navy Digital, the Defence Hackathon builds on the success of the RAF Hackathon held in 2021. Extending the Hackathon across the MOD enables the identification of talented individuals in any profession who have a technical skillset that will benefit Defence Cyber and Digital."

Teams were given criteria such as technical feasibility, business value and then executed their idea over a strict 2-day window.\u00a0"

            "text": "Talking to the teams themselves, they were almost inappropriately enthusiastic and very diverse. It was great to see a genuine mix of backgrounds, ranks, gender, ethnicity, experiences and specialisations, both military and civilian. Not that you could see much of this at first glance \u2013 the only uniform was a hoodie with no clue as to rank. There was also no hierarchy, everyone had an equal voice, their value was judged solely on what they said or did.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "The winning team developed something special. They\u2019d chosen to attack the sustainability and environmental challenge and developed an app which used open-source thermal satellite imagery, overlaid on maps and integrated with data from smart meters, to show which buildings on a military establishment were energy inefficient.\u00a0"

There were 6 Navy people represented in the teams from a mix of places, some had worked in digital before, whereas some didn\u2019t know such jobs existed and had entered because of a personal passion. 2 of them were between jobs, on holdover, and as such one of them has subsequently joined us here in DNA.\u00a0"

They had fantastic ideas born of their individual experiences over the course of their careers and they had the skills and aptitude to do something about them. In addition, they all had a passion and aptitude for digital as the common leveller."

There are loads of development opportunities out there, we simply need to help people find them.\u00a0"

Another team had developed an app which allowed you to report potential security incidents from your phone, use the camera to take a photo and the location services to drop a pin. These alerts then went to a central dashboard where a user triaged them, could task others to respond and could issue push notifications to users in the vicinity to keep them updated. Whilst this was a great use case, it could also have been used for literally anything \u2013 building defect reporting, parcel notifications from the mail room, etc."
