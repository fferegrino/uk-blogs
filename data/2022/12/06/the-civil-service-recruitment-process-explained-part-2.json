This means for each role we advertise we consider what you will need to demonstrate in your application and interview for us to assess whether you will be successful in the job. This makes the interview process fair and straightforward to prepare for, gives us the best possible chance of finding the right person for the job, while improving diversity and inclusivity. Success Profiles is a \u2018competency-based\u2019 assessment framework. It assesses candidates against a combination of 5 elements \u2013 behaviours, experience, ability, technical skills and strengths.\u00a0\u00a0"

This blog focuses on technical assessments. Check out our previous blog to read more about nailing statements of suitability and the Civil Service behaviours.\u00a0"

These can be tested through questions, presentations or technical exercises during interview. For example, Software Developer or Data Analyst applicants have completed programming or coding assessments. Questions asked will encourage you to demonstrate your specific professional skills and knowledge related directly to the job role. Technical skills are marked out of 3 and you will be awarded a proficiency level. You can prepare for technical skills questions by reading the skills required for the role as listed on the Capability Framework page on GOV.UK. For example, see the skills needed to be an IT service manager.\u00a0\u00a0"

However, it is important to understand that we don\u2019t expect candidates to have the same skill level across all sections of the Capability Framework. Even the strongest candidates are usually better in some areas than others!
