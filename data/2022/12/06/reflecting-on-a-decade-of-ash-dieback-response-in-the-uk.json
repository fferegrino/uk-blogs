The affected tree would shed the affected leaf and the cycle would repeat."

Repeated damage to larger susceptible trees weakened them at different rates, but if honey fungus (Armillaria species) was present it would also attack the trees from their roots, killing them more rapidly."

            "text": "Around this time a decade ago, I and very many colleagues from Forestry Commission and other Defra Group organisations worked over an extraordinary weekend across the UK looking for signs of ash dieback, and the results were stark. Many sites of recently planted ash were found to contain infected trees, and further infected ash trees in the wider environment were found in many parts of South East England, but also locations in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland, South East and North Eastern Scotland."

Likewise, there are now many more plant health inspectors in APHA than a decade ago ready to respond to potential plant health outbreaks."

            "text": "Since 2012 we have learned that ash dieback was already present in the UK many years before spores blew in on the wind from the near continent.\u00a0 We are beginning to comprehend that, although many ash have died quickly, for many more of our millions of ash, the disease is going to be chronic.\u00a0 We now understand that there is no precise timeline or pattern as to how an individual ash tree or woodland will cope: Age is an important factor; site conditions play a significant role, with severe decline often observed in woods with poor, thin soils (such as the South Downs, and limestone pavement in the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales), sites prone to waterlogging or regions with higher rainfall and (as mentioned earlier,) presence of honey fungus. Slower decline is often observed with lone trees in open countryside.\u00a0 Tree owners must prepare for the eventuality that most of their ash will likely die or be severely damaged, but resources have been developed to assist them including guidance on management (LINK Managing ash dieback in England - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)), case studies (LINK Sharing Forestry Knowledge: Managing Ash Dieback - Royal Forestry Society (rfs.org.uk)) plus advice and support that local FC Forest Services experts can provide to help build long-term resilience in woodland management."

Scientists including many in Forest Research (Alternative link: Ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) - Forest Research), RBG Kew \u00a0(Alternative link: Watch: How Kew is tackling ash dieback | Kew) and the Living Ash Project should not be left alone to search for these trees, so if you see a healthy-looking ash (as pictured below) amongst obviously poorly ones in spring or summer take a photo.\u00a0 If it still appears healthy in another two-three years it might be you have discovered a tree essential to the future of the species in the UK, so don\u2019t keep that knowledge to yourself - please report it to us."
