While I was playing with friends in the neighbourhood, a dog charged towards me and bit my right foot. I screamed and alerted my parents! They rushed me to the nearest hospital in town. While putting the yellowish-brown iodine solution on my wound, causing a well-remembered burning sensation, the nurse asked if the dog was a \u201cmad dog\u201d. I was not given any jabs. I still remember the tooth marks on my foot."

            "text": "My mum later told me that rabies was called \u201cMad Dog Disease\u201d and \u201cHydrophobia\u201d (fear of water) in China. \u00a0According to her knowledge, rabies was diagnosed by offering water to the person who was bitten by a dog and watching their reactions. My six-year-old self was satisfied that I did not catch rabies after I tested myself with a cup of water! Only after I joined the rabies group at APHA, did I realise that the immediate treatment for dog bites should be to wash the wound with soapy water before visiting the hospital."

However, rabies can still be re-introduced so long as rabies is present in other parts of the world. Many illegally imported dogs are seized at the UK border every year and a mixture of ignorance and putting profit first could bring rabies back to the UK if a rabid (infected with rabies) animal slips through the net."

Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2018, nearly 2,000 cases of rabies were reported in Ukraine, mainly among wild and domestic animals. This dropped to around 700 in 2021, probably due to a reduction in tests performed due to the pandemic."

The UK government and APHA have taken steps to mitigate the risk of rabid animals entering the UK whilst supporting the needs of Ukrainian people and their pets when allowing entry. So far, colleagues in APHA\u2019s Surveillance and Laboratory Services Department have tested over 1,000 Ukrainian pet samples to check if the animals have been vaccinated against rabies in order to protect the UK from introduction of the disease."

            "text": "EBLV-1, the most common lyssavirus in Europe was not found in the UK before 2018. The serotine bats that harbour this virus live close to people, for example in loft spaces. Recently, one positive bat in the UK bit a person (means of virus transmission) before being humanely euthanised on welfare grounds. Thankfully, the person bitten was a bat carer who had been immunised with rabies vaccine."

            "text": "Both bat lyssaviruses have been responsible for human deaths in Europe where prior vaccination or post-exposure treatments were not applied. In 2002 a bat worker from Scotland died following exposure to EBLV-2 and this highlights the vital role APHA plays in helping to mitigate risks of human exposure to a group of lethal viruses."
