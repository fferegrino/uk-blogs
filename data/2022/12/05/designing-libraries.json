It is also a shop window for expertise and specialist services. Moreover, the website is an advocacy tool because its case studies show what good design can do."

These include library case studies, news, a Marketplace of supplies and services, and other useful information. So it\u2019s a great resource - covering not just library design but those all-important fixtures and fittings."

The world is a very different place \u2013 currently grappling with war, the impacts of climate change, and a global cost-of-living crisis. The context within which Design Libraries operates is ever-changing. The website needs to reflect the challenges of the time and to predict future trends in library design if it possibly can."

As winter approaches and inflation rises, libraries can expect new visitors, perhaps escaping unheated homes. We will, of course, extend a warm welcome \u2013 and hopefully enrich lives in other ways as well."

The second round of Arts Council England\u2019s Libraries Improvement Fund focused on enabling library services to \u201cinvest in a range of projects to upgrade buildings and technology so they are better placed to respond to the changing ways people are using them\u201d."

I am leading a small team taking the project forward."
