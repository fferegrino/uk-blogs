Run by NE in partnership with Defra and EA, the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) programme provides 1-to1 training, advice and grant support to farmers and land managers to reduce water and air pollution from agriculture. In recent years it has reduced the number of serious water pollution incidents in England by almost a fifth."

These farms represent less than 20% of the farms in the catchment but 43% of the farmed area within the parts of the Wye catchment in England. To date in 2022, 183 farm holdings in the Wye catchment have contacted the CSF programme. It\u2019s estimated that the implementation of CSF recommendations has reduced agricultural phosphorus annual loads in the Wye catchment by 8.5% and led to an additional 2% reductions via other agri-environment options."

They look for evidence of pollution and make a comprehensive assessment of farm infrastructure, management practices and records. Compliance with multiple regulatory regimes is assessed. This includes Farming Rules for Water, which require farmers and land managers to keep soil on the land, match nutrients to crop and soil needs and keep livestock fertilisers and manures out of the water course."

Their farm was primarily arable, and prone to overland flows due to the steepness of the land and run-off from a neighbouring farm, leading to serious soil erosion. The run-off was also contributing to flooding in the local village."

            "text": "Following advice from CSFA James Griffiths, and after receiving a CSF funded Farming and Land Management Advice (FaLMA) Specialist Advice visit, a Water Management Plan was created. Jo and Brent then applied for a Mid-Tier Countryside Stewardship Agreement, which included grant options to revert arable land back to grassland along with a supplement to manage the grassland without inputs of inorganic fertiliser."

            "text": "This allowed them to change the cultivated fields back to grassland, which stabilised their soils and reduced soil erosion from the overland flows. They also carried out capital grant works as part of their Countryside Stewardship agreement as advised in the Water Management Plan. These works included installing dams known as \u2018check dams\u2019 to control the water flow rate, as well as sediment ponds to collect run-off and sediment. All of this has contributed to the reduction of nutrient loss (nitrogen and phosphate) from the holding, which will have a directly positive impact on the River Wye along with helping to decrease flooding issues."

In parallel, EA has boosted its water quality monitoring in the catchment and is using this data to make recommendations on where catchment-based solutions can have the most impact. This in turn helps the CSF team prioritise visits to farms at the highest level of diffuse pollution."
