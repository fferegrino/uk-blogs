During one of the lockdowns, I was struggling with my mental health and reached out to my local NHS services for support. I met with a therapist, who listened to what I was going through and suggested a referral for an autism assessment."

            "text": "Flexible working has reduced the amount I travel, which has been a benefit to my mental health overall.

            "text": "The increased reliance on emails and chats removes key elements of communication. Beyond the lack of face-to-face interaction, these approaches can appear more direct, and it can be more difficult to clarify the intent behind a request. To give a specific example. Microsoft Teams has been both a huge benefit, as well as source of significant stress and pressure."

On more difficult days, I can remain present, even if face-to-face or video calls are too much. Meetings with clear etiquette, for example \u2018muted unless speaking\u2019 and \u2018raise hands to speak\u2019, are a lot more structured, helping me to follow and participate in conversations. The status function means that I can see when others are online and if they are available to talk."

            "text": "On the negative side, people\u2019s expectations for responses are or feel much greater than before. Meetings lacking clear etiquette are difficult to follow and almost impossible to participate in. There can be a lot more happening at the same time and it isn\u2019t always possible to show that you are trying to participate in several conversations."

            "text": "The balance between benefits and challenges varies from day-to-day. The days with a lot of meetings tend to be the hardest, but this is especially the case when the chair is not coordinating the conversation or there is a lot of background noise."

The actual impact is often determined by how new technology is used and applied. It\u2019s therefore essential to consider approaches that can be more inclusive and for all of us to be open and responsive to receiving requests for adjustments from those impacted."

The examples I\u2019ve shared here are based on my own experiences and are not intended to be representative of anyone else. My hope is that my experiences can contribute to an increased understanding and mobilise support for improving accessibility and inclusion."
