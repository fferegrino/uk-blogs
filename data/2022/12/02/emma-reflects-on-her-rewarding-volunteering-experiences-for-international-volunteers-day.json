This has been through mentoring, coaching and now actually making sure people get the resources and teaching they need to help them with their work. This led me into volunteering - I am an Enterprise Advisor which works with a local school or college, helping them with their Careers programme from a strategic perspective. I am linked to two local schools in my local area which motivates me even more."

There are so many myths out there that young people hear, and I want to break those stereotypes. Especially working at HMRC, young people assume if you work there, you will need to be good at maths. This is not necessarily the case as there are many jobs at HMRC and the Civil Service that are not mathematical."

I spoke to them about careers and what they are looking to do as a career, and some of them had no idea. The conversation moved on to talking about the skills they currently have. Let\u2019s take team working; a skill most careers require, at first, none of them could think of any examples."

This is also part of the Enterprise Advisor role, but something that anyone can get involved in as part of volunteering. Most of the students are so surprised to see that they can work, gain the benefits, and gain a qualification at the end."

It is not to say that every role can be as flexible, but everyone gets an opportunity to volunteer. Whether that is helping in schools with CV writing and interviewing skills or helping people on the Princes\u2019 Trust. We all get to help each other as well with mentoring, coaching and other job opportunities. HMRC recognises the benefits of giving back to each other and to the community that we serve as civil servants."
