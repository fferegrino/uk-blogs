The standards come from guidelines produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These guidelines ensure classifications are representative of the quality of the water in which people are likely to swim."

            "text": "There are circumstances when a few samples are excluded from classification, either because these are highly unusual or because other measures - such as signage from local authorities - have advised bathers not to swim at the time these were taken. There are not many samples excluded this way \u2013 this year, for example, we only excluded 8 samples taken during incidents or extreme rainfall and 58 because bathers were proactively warned of weather conditions likely to lead to a drop in quality. This is the way the Regulations classifications scheme is a truly representative of the quality of the water in which people are likely to bathe."
