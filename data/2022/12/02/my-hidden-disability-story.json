However, the diagnosis meant that I was able to have a specialist assessor come and give advice on what I needed. This included noise cancelling headphones, software to read text aloud, more time to do things, and some training. I also got a civil service disability passport."

I need space to concentrate, and for people to split long blocks of text into summaries and bullet points. These adjustments also usually make things better for everyone."

For me it\u2019s particularly stressful each month using online banking to pay my credit card. I need to be in a relaxed frame of mind before I psych myself up to do it. I\u2019ve learnt to have notepads, paper, calculator, also coded notes of passwords in case the facial recognition of the tech doesn\u2019t work."
