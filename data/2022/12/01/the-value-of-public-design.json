Over the past 10 years new design practice has emerged, including in the public sector. Initially service design, which has already transformed transactional public digital services. More recently strategic policy design, which seeks to design public sectors or organisations at system-level."

            "text": "Although commercial models of design are useful comparators, they are insufficient for the public sector. What governments do is just more difficult. Whereas industrial innovation or MBA-style models essentially drive to a financial bottom line, the outcomes that governments seek are multifaceted, often including changed public behaviour or equity share across society. Consequently, policy designers work to a triple-bottom line that seeks to understand and make trade-offs against 3 bases: intent (what elected representatives and leading officials want to change in the world), systems (the environment that the policy or service will need to survive and thrive within, including finance, legal, process, stakeholders), and citizens (what do the public need and what will they respond to)."

            "text": "The traditional way of making public policy and services is for a policy idea to be implemented, then its impact is tested and reported on. Design turns this on its head, advocating for evidence-led policy policymaking and iteration through a research-design-test-build process. In practice, this guides policymakers to only commit to build or implement once they have confidence that the initiative is deliverable and it will produce the expected effect. This ensures the investment choices that we make as a nation are of the highest quality possible and that they maximise public value and give citizens meaningful outcomes. Perversely, officials often perceive experimental design as high risk, but in fact it is an exercise in controlled risk management through incremental reduction of uncertainty. This kind of design-led risk assurance model already has a foothold at the heart of government through implementation of Sir Michael Barber\u2019s thinking, both in HM Treasury on Public Value Framework and Number 10\u2019s network of delivery units through their \u2018deliverology\u2019 model."

National Audit Office say, \u201cOrganisations need to take a whole system approach to achieving government outcomes \u2026our evidence shows that the greatest influence on improvement capability comes from giving people opportunities to innovate, and ensuring that they are clear about how their work benefits the end user.\u201d Design practice provides a holistic, systematic process and toolkit to tackle these issues at the macro-level of systems alongside the micro-level of citizens."

Institute for Government further define the need saying, \u201cThe model of \u2018generalist\u2019 policy officials is outdated and should be replaced \u2026Building capability to make more effective policy is a matter of combining subject-matter knowledge with the relevant skills to create a high-performing multi-disciplinary team\u201d. But in practice, the selection and use of the right tools and people can be labyrinthine and bewildering for the average official. They are faced with a barrage of terminology, like systems thinking, user centred design, agile project management, amongst a myriad of other competing ideas that are promoted across government. Design practices provide an umbrella framework or mental model to understand the value and place of these approaches in the process of making policies and services. It has a unique cross-cutting function in government because it provides a mechanism for all other professions and functions to constructively collaborate. It provides the lingua franca for everyone to work together."

In straightened times, with pressures on headcounts, design is an under-exploited lever for increasing productivity. The prize for organisations that invest in design are tangible and real. The case is strongly made by\u00a0Innovate UK, and the\u00a0McKinsey Design Index\u00a0shows businesses that invest in design outperform their industry counterparts by 200%. Design practices guide officials to focus on delivery and outcomes. It is the most effective way to join-up policy and delivery. The headline, high cost of public policy and services that fail should also be noted (for a list of failures that were made without design expertise see\u00a0The Blunders of Our Governments). The weakest initial policy ideas are often based on assumption and bias. Design practice recognises the value of using assumptions to get policymaking kick-started, but guides policymakers to quickly and systematically prove or disprove them, so that government\u2019s solutions are grounded in reality, increasing the likelihood they will provide meaningful outcomes for citizens."

How organisations work with people to feel control and agency over their lives and communities can make a difference.

When design challenges are too big or difficult for generalist officials to tackle, they need design experts to turn to, so we also need to invest in deep technical skills of designers.
