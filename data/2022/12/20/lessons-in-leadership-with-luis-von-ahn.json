Von Ahn\u2019s goal in creating Duolingo stems from observing that in his native Guatemala, language learning was the preserve of the wealthy and that language barriers increased poverty and conflict. In 2010, Duolingo was thus born to open up access to language learning, regardless of your wealth or walk of life.\u00a0"

Back in 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown made it tricky for colleagues to meet up and practice Spanish, so like everyone else, we adapted to online interactions. Two years later, we have grown into a network of 42 language groups including a Bilingual Parenting group, with more than 9,500 members participating across government, the UK and overseas.\u00a0"

CSLN members had the chance to hear more about Duolingo\u2019s story in early December at our event with Luis Von Ahn \u2013 it went down a treat with more than 850 people tuning in."
