Downloadable from both official and third-party app stores, as well as from online websites, access to these applications has also never been easier. Some of us may receive electronics for Christmas and whether it\u2019s a new phone, laptop, or tablet, we\u2019ll head almost immediately to one of these stores to download our favourites. But is it safe to do so? This virtual marketplace may seem secure on the surface but dig a little a deeper and you\u2019ll discover a whole host of threats associated with digital applications. The government has recently published a new Code of Practice which will strengthen app security and privacy for consumers, but in the meantime you should follow the advice of our cyber experts. But first we're going to explore this by first looking at data tracking before discussing some common risks associated with applications and sharing some useful tips on how you can become \u2018App Aware.\u2019"

Alphabet, the conglomerate famous for Google as well as Facebook and Twitter, were found to be the top three recipients of user information. Now, you may be sitting there picturing your personal data from match three games being packaged up and parcelled off to the folks running social media. However, the majority of mobile apps actually contain utilities from these large organisations that enable them to track and collect user data straight from the application itself."

It may be cultivated and used to push out targeted messaging, such as advertisements or it may be used in business reports on performance, user preferences, or customer experiences. For example, if you download a fitness app, or a new game from the \u2018App Store,\u2019 Google can show you adverts for similar or related products."

What\u2019s the big deal if third-party organisations are tracking the apps I use or the data I upload to them? In some circumstances it can be incredibly useful. You may be shown a product or service you were previously unaware of that could have a positive impact on your day-to-day life. However, with our personal information and data stored away, we\u2019re at risk of potential cyber threats from within the apps themselves. Let\u2019s have a look at a few of these below:"
