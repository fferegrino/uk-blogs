The Executive Education Programme in Digital Transformation for UK Local Government was designed to equip senior local government officers with the confidence and expertise they need to lead the successful digital transformation of public services. We were joined by 98 attendees from 70 local authorities across the country, and feedback from attendees was so positive that we\u2019re running the course again in February and March 2023 - register via the AWS website by 21 January 2023."

We'll continue to work on this next year ahead of the fifth anniversary in July."

You can also register for the virtual Show and Tell on Wednesday 25 January, where we\u2019ll be sharing more findings from this phase."

While the cyber support programme is now coming to an end, we\u2019ll continue to work through the remediation plans with the councils that are already enrolled, and turn our attention to how we can support all councils through the Cyber Assessment Framework."

The two-day virtual training course, facilitated by NobleProg (UK) Ltd, provides a deeper understanding of agile and digital in a local government context through interactive sessions and exercises.
