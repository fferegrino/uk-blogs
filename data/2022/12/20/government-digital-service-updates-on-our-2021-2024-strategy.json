I also noted that the strategy was a moment in time, and we expected it to change and adapt based on what we discovered."

            "text": "On product, we started with an ambition to take the learnings from GOV.UK Verify and build a new digital identity and single sign-on service for all of government - something we are now calling GOV.UK One Login. Looking back, we had a mountain to climb in terms of designing and building the product set, building confidence with our customers across government, and securing funding to get it all done. The team has developed from a small group to large, high-performing team who are demonstrating user-centred, agile delivery at an extraordinary pace and scale. This success is down to a combination of a deeply talented delivery expert in our Digital Identity director, Natalie Jones, a focused and united team, and strong support from HMRC, DWP, Home Office and others across government. There is a long way to go, but we are in beta, and making real progress. We\u2019ll be blogging more about this in the next few months."

From the response to HM Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death, the UK\u2019s help for Ukraine, Cost of Living, and many others, the team have diligently worked with No.10 and colleagues right across government to make the content simple and accessible to all. Behind the scenes, they have been making GOV.UK simpler to use and navigate, improving the civil service facing publishing tools, and migrating to new web hosting infrastructure."

The individual platform products - like GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Pay and the GOV.UK Design System - have gone from strength to strength, and are mature products with ambitious development roadmaps in their own rights.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "What is even more exciting is our fledgling plans to integrate these products into our newest offering, GOV.UK Forms. There are nearly 8,500 document-based forms published on GOV.UK, and most are inaccessible, put an unnecessary burden on the end user, and are expensive for government to manually process. To fix a problem of this scale, we need to go wholesale - we cannot rely on digital departments to get to every single one. Instead, we want to develop a digital \u201cbuild a service\u201d product that can be used by civil servants in operational and policy roles right across government. We\u2019ll be talking more about this in the coming months."

In some areas we have gone further and centralised a small number of professions like technical architecture and cyber security. We have also set out our locations strategy, with a commitment that in addition to our existing strong foundation in London, we expand our teams in Manchester and Bristol."

This has meant we have had to make prioritisation decisions to make sure our people and resources are focused on the highest value areas. In the summer, we announced that we would be sunsetting our hosting platform, GOV.UK PaaS. More recently we have made the difficult decision to close both our GDS Advisory service, referred to in my previous blogpost as \u201cGDS Expert Services\u201d and our in-country GDS Advisory International work."

While the ambition remains central to our mission, we discovered more dependencies than we had anticipated. The biggest dependency we discovered was having the GOV.UK One Login service rolled out across more services to enable a persistent, logged in user journey.\u00a0"

We have come a long way in the past decade, and the user experience of most government services has vastly improved. However, where once the UK was world-leading, and positioned first in the UN\u2019s e-government index, we have now slipped to 11th. We need to look to those countries who have now gone past us - Denmark, Estonia, Korea and others - and adapt our approach towards a more joined-up and proactive experience of government. We will be blogging more about this in the coming months."
