This blog is the first in a series of guest posts from policy teams sharing their experiences of working with our Collective Intelligence Lab. We hear from Letitia Holden of the Civil Service\u2019s Policy Profession Unit about using collective intelligence to better understand policymakers across government."

We were keen to try this new method of engaging with people as a way to gain an understanding of life in the Policy Profession, our strengths, and where we need to do more. This blog shares personal reflections of working with the Collective Intelligence Lab, and what we learnt."

A participant logs in and sees a single statement, which they can vote to agree, disagree or pass. They cannot reply directly to the statement, but they can propose their own alternative statement, or a statement on the broader theme. Other participants will then vote on their contribution, without knowing the author."

            "text": "This was an iterative process. The CILab helped us by providing feedback on what made for an effective seed statement, and gave constructive challenge about what we hoped to find out by putting specific statements forward. Their experience of running previous debates was beneficial to avoid common pitfalls, and to help us think through what we were really trying to find out."

We were given a set of criteria, and independently reviewed all new statements from participants \u2013 noting whether we thought statements should be approved, declined, or amended. During a daily moderation meeting, we would then discuss our views as a panel to reach a final decision."

            "text": "This was an interesting exercise. The panel had different backgrounds and experiences which they brought to moderating, for example, we had panel members who were very new to the Civil Service, from the private sector, and longstanding civil servants. Discussing the statements being put forward by participants in real time was valuable. It prompted team discussions about which statements resonated with us vs. which were a surprise, the role of the Policy Profession in responding to the different needs of policy makers, and what our priorities should be.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "New topics emerged during the debate from participants. An example was a discussion around management responsibility, where participants agreed that policy professionals should be able to progress in seniority without necessarily taking on management responsibilities. This was in the context of statements seeking recognition of policymaking expertise and experience, and was something we hadn\u2019t discussed in previous engagement with policy professionals. This demonstrates the value of giving participants a platform like Pol.is to talk anonymously about topics which matter to them.\u00a0"

CILAb's tools allowed us to identify voting patterns amongst discrete groups of participants, drawing out themes and highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Matching voting patterns to anonymised demographic data helped us understand how representative our sample was, and to find any demographic trends in voting patterns"

We are considering what further engagement we can do, in order to learn even more from our participants about the views they shared with us.\u00a0"
