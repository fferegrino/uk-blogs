I was paired up with Jaie Samson, also on this secondment with the usual role as a Lead Delivery Manager in the team who create digital services for the Office of the Public Guardian. Jaie and I had different, but complimentary skills for the mammoth task. Combined with Ros-Mari Mitova, Gina Gill\u2019s Chief of Staff, and Jamie Not, Gina Gill\u2019s Business Manager, we had the \u2018dream team\u2019 forming."

Making the most of the contacts I have built up with teams from across the MoJ in my substantive role, I carried out a series of focused discussions with business areas to understand what they would want out of a Digital Innovation Campaign \u2013 I named this \u201cQuick and dirty user research\u201d. What types of events would pique people\u2019s interests? What subject matters do people engage with most? What are no-go areas? Essentially, I was trying to define effective vehicles to promote the themes set out above."

            "text": "I saw some trends in these discussions: People want to hear a unique perspective on the subjects we cover; they want to be inspired to innovate; and they don\u2019t want to have their time wasted. I was surprised at how different areas of the MoJ saw innovation in different ways. One discussion with an operational colleague in the Prison space shared their version of innovation as encouraging people to make the most of the basic services already available to them. A discussion with a colleague in the People Group shared their version of innovation as a route to solve broader problems."

The kind people at Reply UK loaned us a robot dog which danced around the lobby of the MoJ\u2019s central HQ building, catching lots of people\u2019s attention, including the MoJ\u2019s Permanent Secretary and Second Permanent Secretary. We also had a VR (Virtual Reality) headset experience on display of a Prison setting created by the Reply UK team in 48 hours \u2013 if this can be created in 48 hours, what opportunities are available with more time?"

We used the attention of the robot dog and the VR headset as an opportunity to push the events, to get the word out there and encourage people to sign up. I was surprised and encouraged at how many people got their phone out and scanned the QR code on the back of the robot dog, even if it was hesitant as it hopped around."

Operational colleagues in Prison and Probation identified internal problems they wanted to try and make progress on. I held a series of kick-off calls with a team of digital colleagues over the two weeks prior to the events to brief them, prepare a consistent agenda and plan the events as best as possible. We then proceeded to visit Manchester Probation Office and HMP Liverpool to use Justice Digital\u2019s discovery techniques in a heavily compressed time period. "

Now, we didn\u2019t validate every statement with users and didn\u2019t manage to explore every element in as much depth as we usually would, but that\u2019s the nature of working in this way. It was a very unique and focused way of working that we rarely get the opportunity to do."

Event Management is far different from Relationship Management \u2013 the pace, the intensity and the pressure. I\u2019ve had the chance to liaise with senior stakeholders and colleagues in a way that I never usually get the opportunity to and that is rewarding in every way. I\u2019m exceptionally pleased to have done my part in building MoJ staff\u2019s understanding of Justice Digital, showing the art of the possible across the digital industry, plus helping to fix some of the bigger and smaller problems staff might be facing."
