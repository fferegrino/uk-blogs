There is a wide range of qualifications available, taking between days and years to complete, covering dozens of different subject areas, and spanning across the full breadth of levels. While the Register already helps users to navigate this, one of our priorities for 2022 to 2025, as stated in our corporate plan, is to improve clarity, effectiveness and efficiency in the qualifications market. To support this, we're redeveloping the Register to give clear and relevant information that better supports your decision making when choosing a regulated qualification."

There are many current and potential users we want to include in our early research, ranging from students and apprentices to teachers, from employers to schools and colleges, and from careers advisers to sector stakeholders. We want to understand the needs of these (and other) users to inform the changes we make."

You can complete a short survey (3 to 5 minutes) or, if you have more time, a longer version. We welcome your views, whether you are a current user of the Register, or are someone who would like to make more use of it. By doing so, you\u2019ll be helping to inform and shape the future of qualifications information available through the service."
