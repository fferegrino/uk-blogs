The new search service is fundamental to both of those goals. It\u2019s essential that people are able to easily find information about what IP exists, and how they can make the most of the UK\u2019s best ideas."

You are very limited in what information you can search for \u2013 typically you need to search for a patent, trade mark or design by its unique reference number. It only works if you know exactly what you\u2019re searching for. These are all things that we aim to put right with the new search."
