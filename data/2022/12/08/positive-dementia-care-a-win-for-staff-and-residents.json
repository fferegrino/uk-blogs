I work closely with every resident to make sure they receive the right care, in consistent environments, to help reduce their stress levels. It\u2019s crucial to us that everyone at Vida feels at home and we do everything we can to create a family feel."

Many people who come to us are often at the later stages of their dementia journey, sometimes because other care homes no longer have the capability to provide the care they need. We are open to anyone at any stage, from diagnosis to palliative care."

Working during the Covid pandemic was a particularly stressful time for my team and I. Even before Covid happened, the social care sector was dealing with recruitment and retention issues, alongside underfunding."

It was a very emotional time for everyone, with the regular changes in guidelines only adding to the pressure. However, overall we did the absolute best that we could and I\u2019m so pleased to see things returning to normal, and families once again visiting our care homes."
