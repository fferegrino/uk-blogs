Which is why I met the Security Minister to discuss whether the further risks and requirements from surveillance sensitivities might be taken forward by his recently announced Task Force.\u00a0 My letter can be found here.\u00a0 The meeting was brisk and business like and I left believing that things will begin to happen."
