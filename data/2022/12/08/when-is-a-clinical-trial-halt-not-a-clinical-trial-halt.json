When stopping rules are used to decide dose escalation, if the stopping rules are triggered, dose escalation will be halted as per protocol and in this case is not necessary to notify the MHRA of the escalation halt. However, deviations from the pre-specified dose escalation and decision-making criteria would warrant the submission of substantial amendment. Substantial amendments will also be needed where the dose escalation stopping rules have been triggered or the dose escalation has reached a pre-defined maximum exposure and an integrated analysis of available data leads to the Sponsor\u2019s conclusion that further careful escalation is warranted. In this case, the dose escalation restart will require the MHRA approval via a substantial amendment."

Particular care should be taken in the case of first-in-human trials and/or healthy volunteer trials where less is known about the investigational medicinal product and the risk versus benefit is very different than in later phase trials - these will as always be assessed on a case-by-case basis but the considerations described above are still relevant."
