The OBR \u2013 an executive and non-departmental public body \u2013 conducts independent analysis to assess whether the government is likely to meet its spending plans. Their forecasts are important for policymakers to inform economic and fiscal policy, and for businesses to help them to plan their investments."

As per Figure 1 below, the Government\u2019s response to high energy prices (Energy Bill Relief Scheme for businesses and Energy Price Guarantee for consumers) is expected to reduce the peak of inflation in the coming year by around 2.5 percentage points."

As a result, the OBR expects Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to fall by 1.4% in 2023 (Figure 2). "

This 4.2% growth in 2022 is due to the strong growth in the second half of 2021 as the economy recovered from the effects of the pandemic. Predicted GDP growth in 2024, albeit weak, is due to inflation being dragged below zero (see Figure 1), which results in the recovery of real incomes, consumption, and investment."

Government has also made plans to raise revenue by, for example, freezing income tax and employee National Insurance thresholds and reducing the 45% income tax threshold from \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3125,140."

In addition to its legislative fiscal targets, the Government included two extra targets that aim to bring the underlying debt down as a share of GDP in 2017-28 while ensuring that Public Sector Net Borrowing does not exceed 3% of GDP. The OBR expects the Government to achieve both of these targets."

This deficit negatively impacts GDP in any year, everything else being equal. The OBR forecasts the deficit to be much wider in 2022, with improvements afterwards."

In the first eight months of 2022, gas imports reached \u00a331 billion, more than four times higher than in the same period in 2021. The OBR expects the trade deficit to narrow due to lower gas prices and the fall in the value of the pound (i.e. making foreign goods more expensive to buy) (Figure 3)."

Several governments around the world have put similar measures in place. Depending on exactly how such support is provided, it is possible that it could be deemed to be countervailable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, resulting in more trade remedy investigations."

Therefore, trade remedy cases involving consumer goods will have to carefully consider the impact that a trade remedy measure might have on the price paid by the consumers. Any burden on consumers might be magnified in the context of the current cost of living crisis. The economic interest test, which is a key component of the UK\u2019s trade remedy framework, considers the impact on affected industries and consumers in order to determine whether trade remedy measures would be in the overall economic interest. Some other countries also have similar tests within their trade remedy frameworks."
