We are always looking to expand our novel offerings to introduce to American engineers, especially from British firms since I myself am a Brit. We looked at the new Queen's Award 2022 list to discover any businesses that would both match our customer base for test equipment but also fit in with our corporate business philosophy. We found a great match in Coltraco and will be commencing our work in creating new markets for them in North America immediately.\u201d\u00a0"
