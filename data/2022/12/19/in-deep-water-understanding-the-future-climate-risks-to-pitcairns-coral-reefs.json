Spanning the four small islands of Pitcairn, Oeno, Henderson, and Ducie, they form part of a remote volcanic outcrop in the Southern Pacific Ocean. Pitcairn is the only inhabited island, with around 50 permanent residents. The Pitcairn Islands are also home to one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, where hidden under its clear waters, coral reefs are abundant."

As well as supporting a large proportion of all marine biodiversity, they directly provide vital services to over 500 million people through the provision of food, coastal protection, and livelihoods."

With global temperatures likely to rise above 1.5 degrees, warming seas, increased sea level, ocean acidification, and increased damage due to storms are likely to lead to mass bleaching and mortality. The UN estimates that by the end of the century, bleaching will affect all of the world\u2019s coral reefs with annual severe bleaching occurring by 2034."

This is mainly due to cooler-than-average sea temperatures because these corals grow deeper than usual for tropical reefs. Some reef areas were found to stretch from 30 m to 75 m depth, meaning they have been relatively sheltered from thermal stress. For this same reason, it is likely that the corals of the Pitcairn Islands will continue to elude severe bleaching for longer than other tropical reefs. However, the report also notes that these corals remain at risk from several other factors, including:"

One way to boost the resilience of the corals and their chances of recovery and survival following impacts from future climate change, is to control and where possible reduce these other local pressures.\u201d says Blue Belt Programme scientist Bryony Townhill from Cefas."
