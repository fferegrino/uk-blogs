These programmes complete the \u2018golden thread\u2019 of professional development for teachers. This golden thread is made up of: high-quality initial teacher education (ITE), support for early career teachers through the ECF, and professional development qualifications (NPQs) for experienced teachers and leaders."

The visits check how well the lead providers are implementing the programmes. The 10 LPMV letters are on our reports website."

NPQ participants found that what they were learning was highly applicable to their role and was helping them improve their practice. Some ECTs said they would like further examples of how what they were learning related to their own subject or phase. We were encouraged to see that most lead providers had noted this and were responding."

            "text": "Some school leaders had concerns about the workload of the ECF programme for ECTs and school mentors. Our inspections did find that workload pressures affected the quality of mentoring. Mentors need to have the curriculum expertise and experience and be given appropriate time to provide effective support. This will help ECTs become confident and competent to teach their chosen subjects and phases."

            "text": "Some lead providers could have given more support to mentors. This would enable mentors to use their knowledge and experience to contextualise what ECTs are learning. This would help those new to teaching make the link between theory and what they find in their schools."

The events reflected on the LPMVs and considered any aspects of the inspection process we needed to change or improve. For example, we have now streamlined the information we require before inspection. This will help to reduce the burden on the lead provider."

We have refined the outstanding criteria to draw a greater distinction between good and outstanding. For instance, we have made it clear that outstanding providers must demonstrate meticulous curriculum planning."

This includes how to distribute our 4, survey links. The views we gather through the surveys provide valuable insights, and we received a high number of responses during the LPMVs. The responses help inspectors to form an accurate picture of the quality of the ECF and NPQ programmes."

You can get in touch with your delivery partner or lead provider for details of how to attend these events."
