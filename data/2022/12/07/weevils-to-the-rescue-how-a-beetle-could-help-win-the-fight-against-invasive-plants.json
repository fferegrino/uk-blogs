He started his career working on Japanese knotweed management in his native Cornwall, which led to an interest in biological control solutions, using co-evolved natural enemies of invasive species to manage biological invasions instead of widespread herbicide applications. He has over 30 years\u2019 experience of invasive species management, both in the UK and its Overseas Territories. Here, he explores how the Environment Agency is using tiny beetles called weevils to manage a huge pest \u2013 floating pennywort."

            "text": "Water fern has the potential to form dense mats of floating weed over lakes, canals, ditches and slow-flowing watercourses. It can profoundly alter the ecology of waterbodies, degrade amenity and aesthetic value, and potentially increase flood risk. The mats consist of millions of tiny floating ferns, which are hard to remove and can deplete oxygen levels in the water when treated with chemicals. Thankfully, a tiny weevil does the job for us and does it brilliantly, saving us an estimated \u00a38.4-16.9 million per annum. Water fern is a headache we never had, thanks to biological control."

            "text": "Water fern is one of many exotic plants that we have introduced to our ponds and subsequently, to our wider environment. Sadly, many of these invasive species don\u2019t have a convenient solution and cause huge environmental and socio-economic harm. Few people realise the damage that comes from allowing the exotic plants and animals from your pond or aquaria into the wild. These organisms have been removed from their native range and the natural enemies that control their growth and abundance. They have an unfair advantage over our native species. Biological control seeks to reassert that natural pressure."

            "text": "Biological invasions are one of the \u2018big five\u2019 causes of biodiversity loss (along with land use change, over-exploitation, climate change and pollution) and cost the GB economy at least \u00a31.7 billion per annum (Defra, 2010). Preventing biological invasions through robust biosecurity is our best option, but where that fails, nature-based options such as biological control have the potential to provide safe and sustainable controls."

            "text": "But it\u2019s also a problem intrinsically linked with climate change. As our climate warms and we have increasing frequencies of frost-free winters, the large rafts of floating pennywort will cease dying back overwinter and start the new growth season in rude health. The combination of mild winter weather, increased nutrient loads due to drought conditions and low summer flow rates will create a perfect storm of conditions that will encourage floating pennywort to extend its range further north and cover our waterbodies in dense rafts of vegetation. Current management efforts are expensive and time-consuming, and they are already failing to keep pace with the spread of floating pennywort."

Researchers at CABI, a global, not-for-profit organisation keen to find natural solutions to the biological threats that endanger our environment, food security and economy, have investigated a weevil that attacks floating pennywort in its native range; Listronotus elongatus."

The weevil spends its entire life cycle on floating pennywort \u2013 the adults graze the pennywort leaves, but the real damage is done by the larvae, that bore through the stems and collapse the dense rafts."

        {
            "text": "The process of approving a new biological control release is strict, very demanding, and rightly so. No one wants another damaging invasive species in our environment. The pennywort weevil has met the strict safety criteria and has been released at a few select sites in England. Early results are very encouraging. The pennywort weevil is already beginning to impact floating pennywort and we hope that this might be one invasive plant that will not exacerbate the future pressures on our rivers and canals."

            "text": "The battle against invasive species is an ongoing one \u2013 and an important one in our fight to tackle the climate and nature crises. The Environment Agency and partners are working hard to improve the environment, fight natural decline, and support nature recovery. And embracing natural solutions \u2013 for everything from flood defence, to habitat management, to pest control \u2013 is a key strategy. So for now, it\u2019s weevils to the rescue as they continue to play a vital role in helping us protect the ecology of our precious British rivers."
