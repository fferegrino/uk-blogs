            "text": "Behind the scenes, these lookups used a combination of datasets from different sources to match a postcode to a geographical area or local authority. This was a very hands-on process, requiring regular updates by our developers as new data became available. This happened when new postcodes were created or local authorities merged, or their boundaries changed. The new data needed to be manually imported, which took a long time and generally required additional tweaking of the data to make it work properly. Between updates, users would potentially be getting incorrect information."

            "text": "It was also slow and difficult to scale up the lookups when there was more demand - we found during some peak times that things struggled and users couldn\u2019t get results."

            "text": "Ultimately, we settled on using the Ordnance Survey\u2019s (OS) Places API. This ended up being the best solution for a couple reasons. Firstly, GOV.UK can access the API for free under the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement. Secondly, their data is updated daily (compared to every 3 months when we updated the data manually) and their API has a 99.9% uptime."

        {
            "text": "To make the Places API work best for us, we built our own application, called Locations API, which fetches data from the OS and stores it ready for our various tools to use. This means we have full control over how it works with those tools, and can easily and quickly scale it up if necessary."

            "text": "We took care to design our application so that it doesn\u2019t overload the Ordnance Survey\u2019s system, using what\u2019s known as a caching approach. In practice this means our application stores all of the postcode data and continually checks them against the OS Places API. We do this at a rate well within the API\u2019s threshold of 600 requests per minute, cushioning the impact of any spikes in demand."
