Because of my health profile, including my ethnicity, and being diabetic and asthmatic, I have actually been in hospital each time I\u2019ve had COVID-19, but each time the symptoms got milder."

It\u2019s like training at the gym - but for our immune systems, helping us to build up our biological defenses."
