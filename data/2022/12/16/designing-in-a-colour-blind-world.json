            "text": "At university I got a truer reflection of what it meant to be colour blind in the world of design. Graphic design uses images and typography to represent an idea, convey a message, or elicit a response. It also relies heavily on the science of colour theory and how humans perceive colour and how colours communicate. This is why it can be beneficial to successful design but a drawback for anyone who is colour-deficient.\u00a0"

The perception is that with accessibility you automatically put limitations on creativity and have to design \u2018simple, boring and safe\u2019. While meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA and legal obligations certainly does limit design in a way, the challenge going forward now lies with designers and visual communicators to think outside the box, but stay within the boundaries of accessibility.\u00a0"
