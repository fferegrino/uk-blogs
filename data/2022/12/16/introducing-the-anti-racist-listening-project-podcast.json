            "text": "So, we held a day of anti-racist activism in 2021 using social media (#AntiRacistSW21), urging senior leaders to take action. Then we published a book: The Anti-racist Social Worker. We spoke at several events, held webinars and encouraged others to make an anti-racist pledge. As a group of anti-racist activists, we thought what next?"

        {
            "text": "We had picked up that many people were grappling with the same tricky and challenging conversations around racism we were having. We wanted to do something to help others work through their own anti-racist action challenges and to share some ideas and insights into how others try to navigate these seemingly everyday issues."

        {
            "text": "We thought of blogs and newsletters, but everyone's got so much to read already. \u2018How about a podcast?\u2019 we said in almost harmony."

        {
            "text": "We're always keen to find new ways to keep the anti-racism conversation going, but we recognise from our own experiences how difficult this can be. This is sensitive stuff. The stakes are high for people experiencing racism and for those trying to navigate the journey to becoming an ally. There is the worry about making mistakes, being misunderstood and hurting people."
