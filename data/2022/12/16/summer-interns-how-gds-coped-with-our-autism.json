We need so much experience for jobs these days that I think we should grab opportunities like this with both hands. I think the skills I have learned about recruitment will help me get insight into how I will be perceived as a candidate in the future."

This will help me in the future if I ever do advertisement work. I got to draft some adverts to attract candidates and write tweets for different government organisations to go on the official websites and Twitter. I trained with the recruitment team and have learnt all the different types of recruitment which will help me in my future job hunt."
