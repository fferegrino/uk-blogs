On the one hand there are students who respond well to such messages, which act as a reminder for why it is important to work hard. On the other hand, there are students for whom such messages intensify pressure around study and act as a trigger for anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0"

Students\u2019 responses can, and do, impact motivation, engagement, and ultimately achievement. Students who respond positively to such messages are more hopeful and optimistic about their exams, are more motivated and engaged, and achieve higher grades. Students who respond negatively to these messages are more anxious about their exams, which interferes with motivation and engagement, and they achieve lower grades.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "The answer is not simply to stop using such messages. That would be denying those students who respond positively the benefit. The solution is to get the right message to the right student, and at the right time. This may mean reconsidering those messages delivered in a group setting, such as an assembly or whole class as there will inevitably be some students for whom this will result in negative emotional and motivational reactions. However, individualised messages could be directed to specific students, or even those in small groups, who will respond positively. \u00a0"

            "text": "So do we know which students will respond effectively? As students\u2019 reactions to these messages are largely private experiences, they can be difficult to gauge from how someone is behaving. The answer to this question can, in part, be drawn from the theme of 2022 Youth Mental Health Day: \u201cconnect meaningfully\u201d. Those best placed to be able to anticipate, and judge, students\u2019 reactions are those that know them the best. At home this is likely parents, carers, or other family members. And in a school or college setting \u2013 at least in relation to learning \u2013 it ought to be their teachers.\u00a0"

Taking the time to talk to students, showing an interest in them, and being non-judgemental, empathetic and supportive will help to build these important positive relationships.\u00a0\u00a0"

All of which contribute to a student\u2019s sense of wellbeing at school or college. That setting is the place where they feel valued, can flourish, and achieve their aspirations.\u00a0"
