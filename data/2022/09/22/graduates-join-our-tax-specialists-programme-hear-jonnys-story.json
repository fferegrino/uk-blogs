            "text": "It\u2019s an interesting and challenging job. I am currently a compliance caseworker in AAS (attacks against the system) in the individuals and small business compliance team. This involves investigating tax returns that have been fraudulently inflated and stopping payments that aren\u2019t due. No two days are the same and no two cases are the same. There is a lot to learn as it all evolves and changes so rapidly, so you can never be in a situation where you know it all. However, there are plenty of opportunities for continued professional development and my colleagues have been a big support. HMRC has also been very supportive through the COVID-19 pandemic, and now that we have returned to the office, the support has continued with morale boosting team activities to try and bond teams who haven\u2019t seen each other for the past 2 years.\u00a0"

I think this also helps in supporting each other through our work and social lives.\u00a0"

Jokes aside, it is a challenging programme due to the fact it is designed to stretch and develop you to the maximum of your potential. I would say use the benefit of your colleagues and wider workplace to help support you, make the most of the revision time, be very organised and stay focused on what you need to do to complete the course. Its 3 years of hard work for a great result at the end.\u00a0\u00a0"

The availability of flexi -time and a real focus on employee welfare is refreshing to see. As an example of this, I had a dentist appointment and as I was worried and pre-occupied, so I forgot to take my break. My manager noticed and said, \u201cyou need to take time away to ensure you are not neglecting your welfare.\u201d This is a prime example of how well you will be looked after by HMRC during your career.\u00a0"
