For me, the bottom line is that being a good policy maker means knowing who your policies are affecting, in what ways and how these impacts differ for different groups of people. This is not a nice-to-have nor an add-on, but a core part of the role."

The campaign is going to spotlight case studies from across government which have incorporated inclusive policy making practices into their work. It will also provide practical guidance on how to develop the relevant skills and knowledge and apply these to your own policy area."

            "text": "Our goal as policy makers should be to design and deliver policy which improves outcomes for citizens and society through the realising of government intentions. Therefore, the most effective and successful policies will be the ones that consider how different groups of people will be impacted and adjust to mitigate the negatives. This is how we\u2019ll tackle the\u00a0disproportionate impacts that some policies have on certain groups and improve policy overall for all. Not only is this an obvious way to make effective and efficient policy, it is also a legal requirement placed on every public sector worker under the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED). It requires all public authorities to pay due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people. Considering equalities in policy design is also important to achieve fairness and remain in accordance with Civil Service values, particularly to act with integrity."

However, this sort of practice was not done uniformly across departments.\u00a0For example, we quickly discovered that the masks given to frontline workers were tested on the \u2018Sheffield head\u2019, a mannequin head modelled on a 6\u20191\u2019\u2019 Caucasian male, meaning it was not effective on a large number of staff who did not fit this description. Brilliant teams from the Department for Health and Social Care and the NHS collected data on the diverse range of staff from across the NHS via an online survey and used the findings to engage effectively with different manufacturers. The result was the use of a broader range of face shapes and sizes in manufacture design and prototypes (including men and women, different ethnicities and different ages) and testing of masks on a diverse range of people including glasses wearers and deaf people."

The team used their experience to identify work they would do differently in future. This included:"

            "text": "One of the key lessons from this sort of case study is that in a crisis it is difficult to gather new intel and evidence in a robust, high-quality and consistent way. Leaving these important considerations until a crucial moment means that, in a best-case scenario, some people will already have been disadvantaged."

            "text": "In a crisis we can really only use what we already know, and so it is imperative that we use non-crisis times to do the work. Equalities\u00a0considerations\u00a0must\u00a0become part of the day-to-day thinking of policymakers, they must see it as a basic tenet of good policy-making."

            "text": "As well as inclusive policy making, it is also important for us to strive toward a diverse and policy workforce. Not only is this important for inclusion and representation, but it should also have knock-on benefits for our policy-making. The more diverse our workforce is, the more representative of the public we\u2019re delivering for, the more likely those voices and experiences are brought into policy-making and the more likely policy will take into account differential impacts. I therefore really advocate for diverse and inclusive teams and leadership and promoting a culture that values the lived experience of staff in the policy making process."

How do I do this?\u2019\u00a0 Much of this campaign is about supporting you as a policy professional practitioner, the \u2018how to do this\u2019 stuff."
