            "text": "Following my degree in health and social care, I worked as a support officer with people with mental health, substance misuse and homelessness issues. Many of them had been to prison and I was interested in their experiences after leaving custody. The CP placement coordinator role gave me an opportunity to learn more about Probation\u2019s role in working with ex-offenders. The risk assessment part of the role was particularly attractive to me as it builds on the skills I developed in my last job."

I assess each project to make sure it\u2019s suitable, ensuring the necessary risk and health and safety assessments are done. Once they are, I let the admin team know so they can start allocating CP supervisors and people on probation to them."

Initially, this might involve doing some internet research to find potential organisations \u2013 such as local authorities or charities \u2013 that might be able to provide suitable unpaid work for our people on probation. I also spend time speaking to contacts, who we refer to as beneficiaries, at organisations I\u2019ve found though my research. The next few days, I might be out doing site visits to assess what work needs doing at CP projects, how long it will likely take, and to identify any potential risks. And the rest of the week might be spent attending meetings, reviewing current projects to make sure all the relevant documentation is up-to-date, and doing admin."

So, I always set aside a couple of days to do them. Plus, I go to a monthly meeting with the local Community Safety Partnership, that\u2019s attended by a wide range of organisations such as the police."
