            "text": "I live in St. Helens, which is a small town in Merseyside, North West England with my husband Matthew. I love travelling, adventure sports and going to the theatre. I started my working career in the Royal Navy at the age of 18 in the Communications and Weapons Engineering Department. At the time, I was still exploring my sexuality and didn\u2019t give it a second thought that I was gay, especially during the 1990s when being gay in the Navy was illegal. During the course of my time in the Navy, I accepted my sexuality but kept it a secret as I felt unconformable \u2018coming out\u2019, especially when I had to share a room with 30 other men and therefore was worried about how they might have treated or viewed me differently. Due to the nature of my job, I was also regularly away from the security of home, family and friends. During my last year of service, the law changed allowing people who identified as LGBT+ to join the armed forces, and whilst it took a while for the culture to change, this was an important step forward.\u00a0"

            "text": "After leaving the Navy I joined Cheshire Police as a civilian, which then led me to join the Civil Service and begin a career in project management. I didn\u2019t set out to do this, but through various roles, I eventually found myself as a Project Business Analyst, which then led to a Project Manager role. I have been very lucky within the Civil Service and never experienced any discrimination due to my sexuality. One aspect that I enjoy about my current role is that I get to deploy and experience all areas of the Home Office, but that does come with the challenge of frequently having to \u2018come out\u2019 to new people. I generally feel that one of the most difficult aspects of being LGBT+ is having to \u2018declare\u2019 your sexuality every time you meet new people or join new teams. While I have struggled with this in the past, in recent years I don\u2019t give it much thought and this could be attributed to the fact that when coming out I have been fortunate to not experience any negativity."
