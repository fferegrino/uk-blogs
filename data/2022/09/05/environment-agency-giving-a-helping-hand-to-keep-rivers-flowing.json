        {
            "text": "The schemes pump water from the ground or rivers and move it to another watercourse to increase flows there. By supplementing the flow of water, we enable some river abstractions to continue for longer, as well as minimising the environmental impact of drought and helping to protect habitats in which dozens of species live."

            "text": "Ten of these schemes have been operating throughout this summer with the first scheme, the Trent Witham Ancholme transfer scheme in Lincolnshire, operating since 30 April. An eleventh scheme, West Berkshire, is due to start operating in September to help ensure abstraction for public water supply across the Thames Water area."

            "text": "Our incident management response includes the management of drought, so our staff regularly undergo training and practice exercises, to ensure we are ready to respond should we, like this year, face a drought and need to put our schemes in action."

            "text": "This year many of the schemes are being operated earlier, and for a much longer period than would be expected in a typical English summer. \u00a0This year we expect that many of the schemes will continue to operate over autumn and into winter to help maintain flows in rivers. Alongside operating the assets, our teams are already planning maintenance and improvements to ensure the assets are ready for future use to keep rivers flowing."
