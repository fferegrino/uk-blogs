The re-launch of the Construction Playbook means it is now a requirement for public sector projects that any ground investigation data collected must be shared as soon as reasonably practical with the British Geological Survey (BGS)."

Data is collected from these boreholes by geotechnical specialists who interpret the findings to inform decisions at feasibility, option selection, design and construction stages of a build project.\u00a0"

This data provides vital geological, geotechnical and geoenvironmental information that is essential for construction, infrastructure and academic research."

Imagine how much better it would be if newly acquired borehole data was submitted to the BGS and then made available for all to use.\u00a0"

            "text": "It would also be beneficial for those who are paying for the construction. Having a more complete picture of previous ground investigation data is crucial for the construction industry as a whole and many other connected sectors. This would enable better design and decision-making around ground risk and cost at an early stage, reducing incidents of \u2018unforeseen ground conditions\u2019 delaying a project."

For example, Farringdon Station is one of the flagship stations on the newly opened Elizabeth Line forming part of the London underground network. This area of construction was supported by a robust ground-truthed 3D geological model created by the BGS and taken forward by the project partners (Dr Sauer Group and BAM Ferrovial Kier Joint Venture).\u00a0"

            "text": "The BGS, alongside the project partners, were able to utilise a wealth of historical borehole data both held by the different project partners and augment this with newly acquired ground investigation data, to better predict the ground conditions. This led to a 70% reduction of in-tunnel probing from original plans and delivered a cycle of risk reduction thereby saving significant amounts of time and costs. Find out more about this project."

BGS has also put in place data sharing agreements with organisations, like Network Rail, Environment Agency and the Welsh Government, committing them, and their contractors, to provide their ground investigation records to the BGS."

These clauses are now in the latest version of the Construction Playbook, which sets out key policies and guidance for how public works projects and programmes are assessed, procured and delivered. The Playbook should be adopted by central government and arm\u2019s length bodies on a \u2018Comply or Explain\u2019 basis.\u00a0"

            "text": "From now on if a government department or agency commissions a contractor to carry out work it should add into the contract a clause that requires the provision of subsurface data to the BGS. This will mean the data collected will become part of the UK repository of subsurface data allowing for greater access and re-use."

            "text": "This is a fantastic FAIR step forward towards the better re-use of data and will affect all construction/infrastructure work carried out by the public sector. For the first time, careful management and curation of ground investigation data will be considered at procurement, costed for and written into contracts as a deliverable."

Increased geospatial data will be available on a project, enabling better decisions, and reducing costs and chances of delay in construction projects undertaken by the government and others, across the UK."
