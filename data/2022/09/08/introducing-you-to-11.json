            "text": "Hi, I\u2019m Taran, and I\u2019m an intern with the RPA, based in Bristol. I\u2019m here as part of the Summer Diversity Internship Programme, (SDIP) which is an eight-week internship with the Civil Service, designed to get university students from diverse and low socio-economic backgrounds into Government. It\u2019s usually taken during the summer after the penultimate year of university."

            "text": "While I\u2019m here, I\u2019m interning with the Organisational Capability Team, which focuses on getting great people into RPA, developing them in the role, and looking for areas to progress employees further, within or outside RPA."
        },
        {
            "text": "I\u2019ve been helping the team with a few of their ongoing projects, whilst also taking on my own task of developing a school-aged work experience scheme aimed at 16-18 year olds for the RPA, particularly focusing on social mobility and under-served regions of the UK."
        },
        {
            "text": "I\u2019m really enjoying seeing the roles of different teams within the RPA and how they work together to deliver an effective experience for farmers - it wasn\u2019t something I knew too much about before I joined, so learning about the industry has been really interesting."
        },
        {
            "text": "Because I\u2019m here for such a short time and I wanted to see as much of the organisation as possible, I don\u2019t really have a typical day. The benefit of this is that I like coming to work with something new to look at every day. This might include shadowing another team in RPA, helping my team with any ad hoc tasks they may have, or working on my school outreach project."
        },
        {
            "text": "While I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve really enjoyed contributing to the team and seeing the development of a project - the RPA is a very collaborative organisation and I do like how everyone\u2019s ideas are heard and considered."
        },
        {
            "text": "While I\u2019ve really enjoyed contributing to the team, I also like having my own project to work on and drive forward, particularly as its in an area that\u2019s important to me. As I mentioned, the SDIP programme I\u2019m on is focussed on getting university students from diverse and low socioeconomic backgrounds into Government, and I see my project as another facet of that, showing a new generation of young people the opportunities available to them in the Civil Service and the importance of the work of RPA."

        {
            "text": "When my internship ends this month, I will start my final year of my economics and politics course at Bristol University. I haven\u2019t really got a fixed idea of what I want to do after I graduate, but going for a permanent role in the Civil Service would probably be one of my preferred options \u2013 recruitment controls permitting. I definitely want to return one day!"
