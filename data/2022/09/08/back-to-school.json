Users don\u2019t need an allotment and they don\u2019t need to find more space. It is something that is minimal effort, minimal space, but it still makes a big difference\u201d"

The smallest change in a design, in a routine or in someone\u2019s life, can make a vast impact. That is why social design is so imperative for today\u2019s society, where the more convenient option often has the worse effect. Designers are needed now, and in the future, to make changes that allow people to make the better choice with ease. Improvements are always needed, there is always a further step to take that can change the way we live for the better.\u201d"
