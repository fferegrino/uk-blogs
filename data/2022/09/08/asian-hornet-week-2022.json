The aim is to raise awareness about the yellow-legged Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) in the United Kingdom (UK) and show how to report sightings. Asian hornet is an invasive non-native species in the UK and is a highly effective predator of other insects, including honey bees, so could pose a serious threat to UK pollinators if it were to become established here."

As Asian hornets can \u201chitchhike\u201d e.g., on imported goods, or moved in vehicles, they can arrive anywhere as well as being \u201cblown-in\u201d from continental Europe, so please look out for hornets in your area and report your suspected sightings as described at the bottom of this blog."

The training ensures more inspectors gain live Asian hornet experience, including engaging in track and trace activities. Before inspectors were issued with a licence and badge, granting them authority to catch, mark and release Asian hornets whilst on the island, they undertook a short course and trained with the Jersey authorities. Without a licence it is unlawful to release these non-native insects once caught."
