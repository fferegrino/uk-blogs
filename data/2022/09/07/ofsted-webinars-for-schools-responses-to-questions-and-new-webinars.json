The EIF is underpinned by extensive research into the importance of teaching phonics until children can decode speedily and automatically. Pupils who struggle to decode unfamiliar words quickly fall behind their peers and struggle to catch up."

Inspectors discuss with leaders which pupils this includes. We will select a sample of these pupils, from Y1-3, and listen to them read."

This will not introduce a \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for a judgement of good. We recognise that schools are likely to always be revising elements of their curriculum. We will not suddenly expect you to meet every single criterion to remain good. Inspectors will continue to use the best-fit approach that is set out in our handbooks when coming to their judgements.

We hope that this helps us to play our part in reducing the unnecessary workload that can be generated by an over reliance on internal progress and attainment data."
