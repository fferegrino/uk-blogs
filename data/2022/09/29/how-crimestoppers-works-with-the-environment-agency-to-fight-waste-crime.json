            "text": "These are also the reasons why the Environment Agency approached us to help them in their mission to stop waste criminals. They recognise how difficult people can find it to report people who pose as legal waste operators because they can often be threatening and dangerous."

            "text": "We first started working with the Environment Agency in 2013. Since then, our service has become even more vital as waste criminals have become even more prevalent, but we\u2019ve noticed the levels of reporting have not increased accordingly. It is vital to all of us that waste crime is tackled to stop damage to our communities and precious environment."

        {
            "text": "Waste crime also impacts all of us financially, as huge sums of public money (our taxes) are used to catch the individuals and gangs concerned, and to clear up after them. Often unsuspecting land and property owners find themselves facing crippling bills to clear up after criminals who have broken into their premises, dumped illegally collected waste and then disappeared."

The more evidence the Environment Agency gathers from all sources to build a case against criminals, the quicker they can stop them and bring them to justice. The Environment Agency, like the charity Crimestoppers, works closely with law enforcement bodies, including the police, UK Border Force, and HM Revenue & Customs to stop waste criminals through whichever route is most effective."
