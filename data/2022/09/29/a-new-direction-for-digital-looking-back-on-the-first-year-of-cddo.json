We have also launched a cross-government strategy, which we are now delivering against. All in all, it\u2019s been a busy year.\u00a0"

As we looked at the cross-government landscape, we realised that the UK had lost ground compared to other international comparators and failed to keep pace with people\u2019s rising expectations. We set a new vision - to be a more efficient digital government that provides better outcomes for everyone by 2025. In practice this means:"

Signalling a new era of cross-government collaboration, it was co-written by the digital leaders of departments, Chief Digital and Information Officers, and their teams, Chief Technology Officers, Chief People Officers, Chief Data Officers and many others.

These commitments are underpinned by a set of process, management information and governance levers to ensure we can hold ourselves to account, such as quarterly business reviews, transparent reporting and a digital dashboard, through which Permanent Secretaries will oversee delivery every six months.\u00a0"
