The advocates are a great bunch of neurodiverse children and young people based in North East Essex who give their views on health, education and social issues which affect their daily lives of autistic children and young people.

I'd never had anyone to play with before as I'd never been included in football clubs at school. It was a challenge to get into the right school, I spent much of my time feeling excluded socially and from society, so I'm very passionate about inclusion."

She had been frightened for months even thinking about it but she managed for the first time in years to have a vaccine because of the relaxed and supportive staff and atmosphere. This made me think about other vaccines for autistic children, and in particular, the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine which my sister is due this year."

These autistic friendly sessions included making someone with autism feel safe and understood is so important, working at the autistic person's pace and supporting them through. Also, the use of sensory items helps people feel calmer in an environment that doesn't have bright lights or lots of people."
