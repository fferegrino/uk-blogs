Based on analysis of these opinions, we highlight below areas that have generally been undertaken well and those where there remains room for improvement."

Across the opinions, over half (58%) of pre-consultation stage IAs received at least one \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019 quality rating (i.e. the analysis is not sufficiently robust to address the issue or has significant flaws)."

The continued shortfalls in this area support the case we made in a prior\u00a0blog post\u00a0for using the BRF review to strengthen our assessment of these wider impacts and make them red-rateable."

Of the 104 final stage IAs we have scrutinised since the introduction of the new template, 24 received an IRN, while all but 5 received a\u00a0green\u00a0rating when revised and resubmitted \u2013 this highlights the value that the RPC adds at this stage in the policy-making process."

In addition, there is still considerable scope to improve the quality of M&E plans, with 38% \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019 between October 2021 and March 2022. Given the importance of\u00a0evaluating the effectiveness of regulations, we want to reiterate that it is essential that impact assessments contain good M&E plans, to ensure that arrangements are in place to support the post-implementation review and allow a proper evaluation of the effectiveness of the regulation and inform decisions to repeal, amend, retain or replace the regulation. Again, this issue is being considered as part of the Government\u2019s current review of the BRF."

Looking across our quality ratings, we find that 97% of final stage IAs received \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018satisfactory\u2019 ratings for rationale and options when the RPC had previously provided a pre-consultation stage opinion. This compares to 68% when there was no earlier scrutiny. Similarly, our rating of M&E plans were higher (100% compared to 60%) for measures scrutinised at the pre-consultation stage, although early scrutiny made little difference to our rating of cost-benefit analysis (88% compared to 86%). We continue to argue for mandatory\u00a0early scrutiny of IAs\u00a0to improve the quality of analysis and help policy-makers and ministers to make better and more effective regulation, to complement mandatory final stage scrutiny to inform ministers and parliament of the costs and benefits of the final policy option chosen."

Since November 2020, we have received only 26 PIRs for scrutiny, compared to the 160 IAs receiving an opinion during the same period. This highlights the need for departments properly to comply with the statutory requirement for PIRs to inform decisions over whether regulations should be repealed, retained, amended or replaced. Again, we argued in a prior\u00a0blog post\u00a0for the Government to improve this in its review of the BRF."
