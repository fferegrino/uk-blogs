There are times when we could all use some inspiration, so we hope to learn from each other\u2019s responses and inspire others."

            "text": "The survey revealed that our creativity at work is intrinsically linked to our personal interests. And for 70% of us, working from home has enhanced, rather than hindered, our creativity by freeing up time for ourselves and for the things that make us happy outside of work."

            "text": "Without the to-and-fro of the daily commute, one-third of us found more time for our own passion projects during lockdown \u2013 such as painting, illustration or photography \u2013 while others started new hobbies, from embroidery and journaling to language learning and nail art. Breathing space for personal creativity means we approach our work feeling more energised and less stressed, with greater freedom in our day to pause, reflect and explore ideas."

            "text": "Making use of our additional time, one-third of us have built a daily walk into our work-from-home routine. Whether it\u2019s a morning stroll or a lunchtime wander, we can all agree that stepping away from the screen and into fresh air does wonders for our productivity. Suddenly, that challenging brief is back in perspective and we feel more inspired to tackle it."

Social media is brimming with fellow designers and studios doing inspiring work \u2013 often a scroll is all it takes to get our own creative juices flowing again."

We also browse art galleries, people-watch in coffee shops and turn to our bookshelves in search of inspiration."
