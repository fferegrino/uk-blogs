Whether they want to brush up after some time off the bike, or whether they\u2019ve just passed their test and want progress safely and quickly, or are moving up to a bigger bike. It\u2019s also designed for specific riders such as blood delivery riders, or other professional riders. There are seven core modules and an increasing number of optional modules, specialising in such things as alternative environments, like off road or race tracks.\u00a0"

Russ Widlake from the Motorcycle Academy in Swansea pitched a course to us that would enable the trainers employed by him and his business partner, Adrian Davies, to deliver ERS to local riders. \u00a0"

Tourism plays an important role in the local economy of our beautiful and attractive county, and we welcome careful drivers and riders. However, when you get on your bike you need to be aware of the individual responsibility of your actions and consider road safety for yourself and others, please remember to drive respectfully and stay safe whilst enjoying Powys\u2019 scenic roads.\u00a0"

Roughly a third of riders who have completed the ERS course across Britain since its relaunch in 2018 have either taken it in Wales or come from Wales. This is a huge win for road safety in Wales. In fact, it is not just Powys Council who have been supportive of the scheme: Dragon Rider Cymru, funded through other local authorities including, Carmarthenshire County Council, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea play a large part in getting riders the advanced training also."
