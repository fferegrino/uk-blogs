            "text": "We had the idea for some time to provide real-time updates for the Lying-in-State queue. But what we didn't have was a single solution - despite speaking to lots of map providers. The result is a combination of a few tools - that's why it worked so well.\u00a0"

            "text": "First, we bashed around how to capture rolling location data into a single source, with input from a provider who'd helped with the Platinum Jubilee map and created the map engine that drove the tracker. We then combined this with the approach we take to livestreaming Remembrance Sunday every year on social media, which we know works via YouTube and other social media platforms. The map is key, but being able to host and share it as a live broadcast for days on end is what made it so useful."

'QueueTube' became a handy go-to tool for the media and public, and overnight became a viral news story in its own right. All the team is hugely proud of what we achieved, and went above and beyond to ensure we could maintain 24/7 coverage from the moment Lying-in-State opened. Seeing it being broadcast at regular intervals on BBC and Sky News was a truly humbling 'pinch me' moment for the team."

            "text": "The data input was simple, it just required an amazing team of digital volunteers at the back of the queue to update and save their location (once checked for accuracy) - literally two taps on a smartphone. The rest was initially inputted manually but over the course of its 4.5-day life, we were constantly iterating in the background. By the end, almost all of it was automated just from saving your location (including the weather!)"
