Since my last blog, we have made progress in developing a feeder that can prevent access by red squirrels while delivering a bait containing contraceptives to most grey squirrels."

            "text": "In 2021, in two woodland areas in Northumberland, we carried out field trials to see if a heavy weight placed on the doors to feeders we designed, could be used to exclude red squirrels. We found that, despite their smaller size, the reds were tenacious enough and strong enough to open the heaviest doors tested and we concluded that we would need something more sophisticated to keep them out."

            "text": "As part of the same trials, using colour sensors attached to the feeders, we also recorded red squirrel coat colour to compare with grey squirrel coat colour, to see if this could be used to select between the two. Although this method has a lot of potential, we concluded that a system based on colour would need a fair bit of development, to overcome the complexity of the data recorded."

The results so far have been very promising. Thankfully, the red squirrels, unlike many humans, were not too sensitive about having their weight taken!"

            "text": "During the Northumberland winter, we monitored these adapted feeders with remote cameras, recording 719 red squirrel weights from 20-30 individuals. The red squirrel body weights ranged between 200g and 319g, significantly lower than those we recorded for 50 grey squirrels (422-760g) in Yorkshire at the same time of year."

Or, for those happy to record other mammal sightings, you can download and use the\u00a0Mammal Society app. Doing so will help conservation efforts as well as important population monitoring."
