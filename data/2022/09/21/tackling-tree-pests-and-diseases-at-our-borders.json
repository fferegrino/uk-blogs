It was my first experience of a busy shipping port and until then I hadn\u2019t really imagined the scale of global trade and just how much stuff we import as a country (around 470 million tonnes of material pass through major UK ports each year)."

This is done at the expense of the importer. When consignments don\u2019t meet requirements and are sat at the docks for a couple of days for further inspection, that can incur costs for the importer too. Delays will disrupt supply chains and can add to reputational damage for importers. This helps to encourage traders to comply with the standards so that their goods progress more quickly through the ports and trade keeps moving. "

We undertake targeted risk-based and random checks and inspections on wood packaging carrying all types of products to ensure the wood meets the requirements. These requirements are laid down in an International Standard - the ISPM 15 standard."

The outbreak has been successfully eradicated, but it was a very costly operation that required felling many hundreds of trees and years of subsequent surveillance. We also had a large consignment of fridges for a well-known supermarket chain arrive from Turkey on non-compliant wood packaging. The issues here were that there was no evidence that the wood had been treated, or even any evidence that it originated in Turkey. It could have come from anywhere in the world, exposing us to any number of different pests and diseases."

Last year, Phytophthora pluvialis \u2013 a fungus-like pathogen known to affect a variety of trees - was discovered in the South West of England and has since been identified in a number of other sites. Previously it was limited to west coast America and New Zealand, so it's possible that may have arrived undetected on live plant material."

These new measures required any importer to give us notice of bringing in any firewood, and this enabled us to gain an insight into the trade and develop an inspection regime based on risk. These inspections have demonstrated that most of this trade is very safe, as the wood is usually kiln dried before it is exported."

            "text": "More trade with more different countries, as well as the effects of climate change, increases our vulnerability in different ways. Pest behaviour is changing, and we now have a climate in the UK that is more conducive for some things that might previously have found it too cold. Extremes in weather also affect the health of trees, making them more vulnerable to disease. \u00a0Being alert to developing trends in pest behaviour and emerging threats overseas helps us to be prepared and stop them establishing here."
