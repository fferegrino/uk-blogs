This was family life as I knew it. Nowadays, this would be seen as not having much, but my childhood was happy and content."

Was I up to it? The other students seemed so knowledgeable. Should I be here? Looking back now on a career spanning 33 years, I think \u201cwow\u201d, that lad from Newcastle, who barely had the qualifications to enter nursing, has been successful through sheer determination."

Nonetheless, I have been able to achieve my goals without believing I am better or above others. I come from humble beginnings so this gives me an insight into the struggles of others I am more empathetic to provide care and support."

            "text": "I always tell the younger generation of career nurses if I can do it then anyone can. All you need is determination, faith in yourself, no matter what anyone says to you. If someone tries to block you or won\u2019t support you then look for a new route, but don\u2019t ever give up - you will be amazing in the end. Good leaders support anyone with ambition and potential. You may not consider yourself to be academic or a forward thinker, but we all have something to give."

So Mum, thank you for being pushy, clever and so supportive in telling me I could do it. I\u2019m now the cat who got the cream AND the Gold Award!"
