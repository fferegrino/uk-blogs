            "text": "There has been extensive coverage across national and regional media around the high number of crab and lobster deaths that occurred in the North East last year, following the publication of a new study. It has yet to be peer reviewed or analysed by Defra and it agencies. Defra and its agencies carried out a comprehensive investigation into the incident which concluded that a naturally occurring algal bloom was the most likely cause of the crustacean deaths. However, the new study claims a toxic substance called pyridine, which could have been released by dredging, was more likely. It has been covered by BBC News, The Daily Mirror, The Independent, ITV News, Yorkshire Post and the Northern Echo."
