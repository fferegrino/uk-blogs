They choose their own business model and create a bespoke service for their childminders.

More information about what CMAs are responsible for and what they have to do legally is on GOV.UK."

There are no additional costs for registering with Ofsted."

Partnering with an agency typically involves paying a monthly fee or a percentage of your earnings in exchange for this support."
