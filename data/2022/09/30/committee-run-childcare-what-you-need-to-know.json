This is the only way we know about any new committee members, trustees or directors, so it\u2019s important that these forms are submitted to us online as soon as possible. It is a provider\u2019s responsibility to ensure that we have received the information that we need to carry out the required suitability checks to add them to the registration."

If you have not received this letter, it means that we are still determining your suitability. You can log on to your online account at any time to check the progress of your application. We will contact you through your online account if we need more information, so it is important to check it regularly until you receive your suitability letter. You can contact us if you are having trouble accessing your online account."

The early years foundation stage (EYFS) states that all registered early years providers must notify us of any changes to any individuals who are directors, trustees, secretaries or other members of a provider\u2019s governing body, such as committee members. We should be notified of a change within 14 days. This means that new committee members should obtain their DBS certificate and submit their EY2 form as soon as possible."

They are also responsible for making sure that the EYFS requirements are met. Each individual makes up the overall registered provider and is equally responsible and accountable for the provision. For example, if we find a provider is not meeting requirements, we will address any letters that we need to send to the registered provider. This will be the committee, trust or limited company and not an individual person."
