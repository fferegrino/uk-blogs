Diversity of sources for scanning, diversity of experts for seminars and diversity of professions bringing analytical and strategic backgrounds to futures. Secondly, senior buy-in was a jumpstart for the programme but making it clear \u201chow this helps\u201d is key for maintaining momentum. Finally, look beyond your department for support. FIP wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without Go-Science, the Open Innovation Team and our external speakers.\u00a0"

For every event, \u201clife after FIP\u201d was considered, with outputs stored and added to a shared futures hub. Now scaled back, the joint team continues to deliver their long-term vision for how futures could help the department deliver on its priorities. They have tied their quarterly horizon-scan into departmental planning processes and worked with teams across the department to consider implications of cross cutting futures challenges. Other teams are already using the materials developed during FIP and they are building better links with futures teams across government to bring in more external expertise.\u00a0"
