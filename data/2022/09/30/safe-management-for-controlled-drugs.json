In many cases, controlled drugs (CDs) are stolen.\u00a0 Drugs primarily intended for animal use can have significant and serious health effects on humans or can be fatal in the wrong hands; drugs such as ketamine, methadone and diazepam are often the target of these break-ins and can end up being sold on the street."
