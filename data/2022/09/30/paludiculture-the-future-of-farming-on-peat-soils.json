            "text": "Paludiculture, or farming on rewetted peat, is a system of agriculture for the profitable production of wetland crops under conditions that support the competitive advantage of these crops. In the context of lowland peat soils it is most usually achieved through raising of the water table to achieve wetland conditions."

            "text": "Paludiculture offers a potential solution for maintaining the profitable use of lowland peatland whilst significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their current (dryland) agricultural use. In 2020, emissions from drained agricultural peatlands in England were estimated at 8.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents. This is around 3% of England\u2019s emissions."

In wetlands such as the Norfolk Broads, there are deep traditions of managing and harvesting reed to provide thatch for houses. However, did you know that we are currently importing 95% of the thatching reed we use?"

            "text": "The opportunities are exciting and the potential environmental gains to be realised are large. However, the commercial growing of these crops in the UK is at a very early stage. There are many barriers to be overcome on how to sow, grow and harvest these crops as well as a need to develop the market for these products. This is where the PEF comes in. As well as offering grant funding we want to hear from the communities and stakeholders that might be thinking about Paludiculutre. Through workshops and events we will learn about the practicalities of adopting these crops. \u00a0In so doing we want to develop knowledge and understanding around these exciting new opportunities. Watch out for November\u2019s blog with more details on the PEF."
