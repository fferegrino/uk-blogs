To help celebrate Forest Week, Judith Peachey, Forestry Harvesting & Arboricultural Manager at Landmarc, explains Landmarc and DIO\u2019s role in maintaining and protecting the woodlands that play an essential role in supporting military training across the UK."

This includes 20,000 hectares of woodland and more than 22 million trees. These forests and woodlands provide vital training environments for our troops, homes for a wide range of wildlife and a source of key wood products."

            "text": "Working with DIO\u2019s foresters and Landmarc\u2019s regional forestry teams, my primary objective is to provide a safe place for military training and create a woodland environment that troops can use to achieve their training objectives. However, we also have a strong focus on long term forestry management, biosecurity and plant health across the range of woodlands that we manage. With trees increasingly being a method of helping to meet climate goals, the importance of forestry on the training estate is ever increasing."

The scale of work to clear windblown and fallen trees was considerable, covering an area of 6,000 hectares and more than 20,000 windblown trees."

This was set up as a certification standard by the Government through its UK Forestry Standard (UKFS) to ensure woodlands and forests meet specific criteria to ensure sustainability of operations and correct practice. It also provides certification for forest products to prevent the use of material logged through unlawful practices."

Thick rhododendron cloaks large areas of the lower slopes of the site and is now causing issues for access, conservation and biodiversity. In order to comply with UKFS and promote better forestry practices, we have cleared a total of 25 hectares of rhododendron since 2018 through an annual cutting programme, racking arisings and spraying off cut stumps with a top-up spray of the regrowth in the following year."
