As an arms\u2019-length body developing apprenticeships and technical qualification for talented people around England, we want to make sure that we are supporting and providing opportunities to all. At IfATE, we have panels of employers from different industries and apprentices completing an array of apprenticeships, who advise on the development of our quality apprenticeships. A few apprentices on the panel have shared their experience and thoughts on the importance of Black History Month."
