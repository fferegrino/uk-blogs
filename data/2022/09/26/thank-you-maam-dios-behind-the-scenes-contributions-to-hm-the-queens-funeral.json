[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]After the sad news of the death of HM The Queen, the eyes of the nation and the world turned to the ceremonial elements that follow the death of a monarch, culminating in a state funeral. The Armed Forces were central to all of this and I\u2019m proud to say were supported all the way by hard and dedicated work by DIO and our contractors."

There was a huge effort behind-the-scenes to support the thousands of Armed Forces personnel involved. The scale of this work was significant \u2013 for example, 10,969 ceremonial and supporting Service Personnel were fed, watered and accommodated by DIO and our contractors across a number of Defence sites."

As HM The Queen died at her beloved Balmoral in Scotland, DIO provided accommodation, cleaning, catering and tailoring support at Edinburgh Garrison to around 320 military personnel. Similar services were provided at Leuchars Station, as well as at Gordon Barracks in Aberdeen for around 40 Police Scotland personnel, who escorted Her Majesty\u2019s \u00a0coffin on its journey from Balmoral to Edinburgh."

In the South West, DIO\u2019s teams organised additional catering and tailoring for approximately 1,150 sailors at several naval establishments around Portsmouth and Gosport."

In turn this meant DIO staff had to source additional temporary facilities, such as portable toilet and shower cubicles, and increase the WiFi capacity. The timings of military duties and rehearsals in the early hours resulted in personnel often taking their meals at unusual times, arranged by our contractors\u2019 catering staff without complaint."

Additional troops were deployed to Aldershot Garrison in Hampshire and the Defence Geographic Centre at Feltham in London, in case they were required. As the site is due to close, there were no catering facilities available for the nearly 900 personnel temporarily staying there.\u00a0 As a solution, DIO and\u00a0 our contractors ESS contacted the Rugby Football Union, who kindly agreed to the use of their catering facilities at nearby Twickenham Stadium. Meals were then transported by the Army\u2019s 7 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps to a dining hall they had set up at Feltham. A real team effort! Personnel at Feltham supported the Metropolitan Police in securing the route between Wellington Arch and the M25 on the way to Windsor for the funeral procession. Personnel from another site were also deployed to Paddington Station to direct members of the public, after the station had to close due to damage to the overhead lines."

Much of this took place on two training sites, Brunswick Camp and Longmoor Camp. Brunswick Camp was used by around 1000 Service Personnel, with approximately 680 operating from Longmoor. As well as British personnel, representatives from the Armed Forces of Canada, Australia and New Zealand were also welcomed. In addition to needing space to practise their marching and musical activities, the personnel all needed to be fed and have facilities to sleep and wash. The DIO team was also honoured to host the new Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited to meet and thank personnel preparing to take part in funeral."

For obvious reasons I can\u2019t go into detail, but SSG staff created a bespoke security system at Westminster Hall, where HM The Queen lay in state, and managed various other security systems across the Royal Estate and Whitehall, including Buckingham Palace and No 10 Downing Street."

As I\u2019ve already mentioned, a number of MOD sites saw a significant temporary increase in the number of personnel staying there. In turn, this of course leads to an increase in work for our security officers as they manage access. At RAF Northolt, the team had to manage the arrival of the press who were there to witness the landing and onward transit of Her Majesty\u2019s coffin."

[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]The Security officers at Horseguards Parade and Hyde Park Barracks supported early morning rehearsals for ceremonial elements. All of this required flexibility and hard work, with officers taking on longer or extra shifts and additional officers deployed to MOD\u2019s head office in Whitehall from their usual sites. In total, our dedicated MGS staff undertook well over 600 hours of additional work in support of Operation London Bridge."

That spirit of collaboration and problem-solving has been crucial, so a sincere thank you to all involved."
