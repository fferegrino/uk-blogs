The results provide us with an objective measure of how year 11 students in England are performing in these subjects and whether performance has changed compared with previous years. There are no results for individual students or schools."

One of the first tasks is to agree a test date, within the test fortnight, that suits the school. When the tests are taken, an NFER test administrator will bring the test papers, invigilate the test and take the completed scripts away for marking."

The Chief Regulator decided not to ask exam boards to reflect this drop in attainment in GCSE maths grade boundaries. This would have contradicted the policy in 2022 for more generous grading to reflect the disruption caused by the pandemic."
