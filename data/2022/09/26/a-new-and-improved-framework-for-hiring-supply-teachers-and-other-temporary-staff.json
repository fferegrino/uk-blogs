The majority of these savings are over the past year or so as we\u2019ve really started to establish the agreement in the market. The agreement provides a compliant procurement for schools, a standard set of terms and conditions that agencies must adhere to, and transparency of costs.\u00a0"

The tool also lets you search for alternative suppliers using a school postcode. It will list suppliers within a radius set by the school and show their framework pricing clearly. Using the tool offers schools a way to get in touch with suppliers directly, with contact details listed for each supplier, too.\u00a0"
