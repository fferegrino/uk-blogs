At the beginning of my rotation, I was given the objective of organising a showcase for Defra of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who are involved in the Atos Horizons program. The goal was to allow these businesses to demonstrate their decarbonisation capabilities, with the opportunity to build a relationship with Defra."

I was given a tour of their offices in Bury St Edmunds where I was shown the innovative approach they have developed to manage waste from redundant technology using environmentally friendly processes. It was great to be introduced to people within the company and find out about the wide range of roles that go into running an SME such as N2S. I was able to return to work and explain what I had seen to my managers."

As this role was more aligned to my studies at university, I found it fascinating to see how we work with the Defra Digital, Data and Technology team."

It was amazing to be involved with a team who are so passionate about their job and what they can achieve to help Defra. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on the account and am pleased to have secured a role as an Agile Software Technologist Graduate at Atos, following my internship!"
