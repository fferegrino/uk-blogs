Two years ago, I was a healthy 27-year-old, when I began to feel queasy and increasingly ill over a period of weeks, until I was hospitalised. I was informed that my kidneys were irreversibly damaged as a result of a rare auto-immune condition named Goodpasture\u2019s, and I later found out that my heart was also weakened."

I follow a low potassium and low phosphate diet: no tomatoes, cheese, chocolate, coffee (hard for an addict like me!), and I can drink very little fluid. I can\u2019t travel or walk far without feeling breathless."

Each year across the UK, around 1,000 people are living donors, usually to family or a friend, although there is also a growing number of altruistic donors. For those without a compatible living donor, the next option is joining the waiting list for a deceased donor."

            "text": "Unfortunately, the average waiting time for a kidney from a deceased donor is two to three years, with more than 6,000 people currently on the waiting list. For Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic patients, the waiting list is even longer due to a chronic shortage of donors. Sadly, hundreds of people die every year waiting for an organ transplant.\u00a0"

The new legislation means that all adults over 18 will be considered potential organ and tissue donors after death, unless they decide they do not want to be a donor, have nominated a representative to make a decision on their behalf after death, or are in an excluded group."

            "text": "This is a hugely positive change that will enable many more organs from deceased donors to be transplanted. But although the system has changed, families are still consulted before donation goes ahead. For many families, making a decision where the deceased person\u2019s wishes are unclear is deeply distressing. Fewer than half of families agree to organ donation going ahead if they\u2019re unaware of their loved one\u2019s decision to be a donor. This rises to 90% when the decision is known.\u00a0"
