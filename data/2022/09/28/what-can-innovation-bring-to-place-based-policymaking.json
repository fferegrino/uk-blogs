We\u2019ve recently been scanning the horizon to identify the next wave of innovative methods with the potential to improve policymaking, which we\u2019ve shared as a set of Experimental Policy Design Methods cards. As well as this, we\u2019ve been looking at policy contexts where our innovation methods might play a useful role, for example our recent series on climate change. This blog shares emerging thinking about an area which can be a key enabler of cross-sector working and innovation on economic and social policy goals: place-based policymaking."

We looked at what is meant by place-based policy, the types of tools and methods that could be used in designing policies for different places and the potential to work in partnership to innovate in place-based policymaking. Through this visit and other conversations with people across the public sector, we are hearing that there is a need for more tools, blueprints and infrastructure to support new ways of working with, and in, different places.\u00a0"

            "text": "From work on over 170 policy innovation projects across government, Policy Lab has developed tools and methods which can be applied to place-based policy work. Film ethnography, for example, has proved particularly effective at understanding how national policy is experienced at the local level. Approaches such as speculative design and co-design can help bring together diverse groups to imagine or design different policies and futures.\u00a0"

This includes our work to better understand people's experiences of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty for the Landscapes Review. We convened users of the Department for Transport\u2019s Manual for Streets to improve the use of guidance for street design. We supported local authorities to bid for Innovation in Democracy funding to run their own citizen assemblies.\u00a0"
