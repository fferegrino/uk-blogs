This is normally carried out in small lawns, but at RAF St Mawgan the decision was made to undertake No Mow May on an industrial scale."

Although RAF St Mawgan does not have an active airfield, it\u2019s still a fully operational station, so we had to make sure the scheme would not conflict with operational requirements. This meant carefully selecting the right areas in which to introduce our no-mow policy, as well as considering the possibility of allowing these areas to \u2018rewild\u2019 following May itself."

A special thanks to Andrew Tregunna, our VIVO South West Grounds Manager, for putting in a great deal of effort to manage and support the scheme."

The Eden project team reported that they\u2019d never seen an area as abundant with this rare plant! The team returned to site and harvested the seed on the 1st September, to help bolster the Eden Project\u2019s seed collection."

This began in March, with vegetation allowed to recolonise areas that were previously kept bare. This has complemented a programme to release hedgehogs, for which grassland edges provide a vital habitat. In broad numbers, RAF St Mawgan has been spared approximately 25 litres of herbicide to date. Over the course of the year this will be closer to 100 litres."

While a hedge full stinging nettles may not be very appealing to us, to a butterfly it\u2019s the Ritz! Likewise, the success of the No Mow May scheme has highlighted the benefits of adapting grounds maintenance approaches where possible, to allow for the growth of wildflowers and grassy hedges which benefit a host of wildlife."
