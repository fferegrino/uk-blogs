Before starting at the FSA, I worked at the Ministry of Defence, publishing information on GOV.UK, and I learnt a lot about accessibility. I was there during the initial release of the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations so I had to learn all about it in a very short space of time."

            "text": "Whilst there is a legislative requirement for public sector websites to be accessible, it is also important to appreciate that the public have to use these websites for information and services that cannot be found elsewhere. This means it is vital that the services and content on the websites we test can be used and understood by the widest possible audience."

For example, I have colleagues who have moved on to detailed and mobile app testing, whilst others have been busy building a bespoke platform for the monitoring and reporting team. You can read more about our work in our 2020-2021 end of year report - and hopefully we\u2019ll also appear in some future blog posts!"
