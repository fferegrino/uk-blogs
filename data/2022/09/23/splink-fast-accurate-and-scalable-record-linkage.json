            "text": "For example, a match on date of birth lends more evidence in favour of two records being a match than a match on gender. A mismatch on postcode may provide weak evidence against a match because people move house, whereas a mismatch on date of birth may be stronger evidence against the record being a match."
        },
        {
            "text": "This simple idea has a lot of power to build highly nuanced models. Partial match weights can be computed for an arbitrary number of user-defined scenarios, not just a match or non match. For example, a partial match weight can be estimated for a scenario where postcodes do not match, but are within 10 miles of each other."

            "text": "These partial match weights are combined into an overall match score, which represents the weight of evidence that the two records are a match."
