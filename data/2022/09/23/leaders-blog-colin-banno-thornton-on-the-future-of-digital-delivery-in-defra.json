            "text": "Why did we do this, you might be asking yourself? Essentially those moves were a necessary prelude to a piece of work aimed at standardising and simplifying our ways of working, which got underway very recently."

            "text": "But first, a bit about the \u2018back story\u2019. Stick with me, though this bit might be a little dry, it\u2019s necessary to help you understand why we\u2019re doing all of this."

            "text": "We were previously set up to deliver across Defra as three separate portfolios (Group Infrastructure and Operations, Major Projects, and Digital Delivery).

            "text": "The major ones are how this will help create a more joined-up working environment both with our own teams but also with policy and operations teams. Users of Defra services will also benefit from greater join up across those services."

            "text": "These changes will also realise increased value from our supplier partners, reduce governance layers and result in faster and more efficient mobilisation and delivery with unnecessary steps simplified. This will be music to the ears of our delivery partners no doubt."

This will be guided by the government\u2019s CDDO Roadmap and aligned to the customer and user services that Defra provides."

I recognise that colleagues in our teams are taking huge steps to establish these sorts of strong relationship at all levels of the organisation, and it\u2019s reassuring to know that our partnership approach is supported from the top."

These sessions provide an opportunity for colleagues to ask any questions, and to hear how the programme of work is progressing. They will continue in the months ahead as we seek to build our partnership approach, one which is supported at all levels of the organisation, and not simply from the top."

These will be supported by some principles, for example adapting and learning, leveraging best practice, and working as one team."
