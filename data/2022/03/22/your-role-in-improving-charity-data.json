In the past, our thinking has been concentrated narrowly on regulation, so on gathering information that helps us hold trustees to account, notably when something goes wrong. That remains a priority, and improved data will further enhance our ability to detect and tackle wrongdoing."

This is partly about ensuring we provide the best possible service to volunteer trustees, and it also makes \u2018good business sense\u2019. It is more efficient for us to support trustees before harm and disruption occurs than it is to investigate and unravel issues once they\u2019ve happened. In other words \u2013 we\u2019re looking to share the power of the data we hold about charities and trustees with charities and trustees themselves."

We want to use what we know about the drivers of public trust and confidence in charities to inform our approach, making public data about individual charities and the sector more widely available. This should support individuals in making more informed and confident decisions about which charities they wish to support. Improvements in this area should also benefit the wider, collective public good, supporting effective funding of charities and research about the sector."

In future years, we will draw selectively on questions from that \u2018library\u2019 for charities to answer in their annual returns, as circumstances require. Our hope is to make charities\u2019 experience of the AR simpler and more streamlined whilst still collecting valuable data that we need to regulate effectively, and we encourage charities to have their say as part of that consultation."
