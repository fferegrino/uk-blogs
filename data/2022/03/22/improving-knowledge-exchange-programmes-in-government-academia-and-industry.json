How might provision for scientists and engineers need to differ from those in other professions?"

This links to the Government Science and Engineering Profession\u2019s own strategy where interchange is also a key theme. We aim to provide systems which allow scientists and engineers to be better connected and gain broader experiences, across government, academia, and industry."

            "text": "One route for this is through designated knowledge-exchange programmes, such as secondments, fellowships, internships, loans, shadowing, and other types of placements, or through mentoring and/or teach-ins. Participating in these schemes can be extremely beneficial for any individual taking part, but also for the teams and departments they join, and the teams and departments they return to. Ultimately, improving science and engineering advice and expertise in government can be achieved in part by improving knowledge-exchange (or \u2018interchange\u2019) programmes across and between government, academia, and industry."
