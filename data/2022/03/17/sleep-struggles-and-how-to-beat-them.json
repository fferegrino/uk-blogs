If you\u2019ve experienced insomnia recently (for less than three months), it\u2019s known as short-term insomnia. If it lasts three months or longer, it\u2019s called long-term insomnia. It\u2019s a common problem, and around a third of people will experience problems with sleep at some point - so you\u2019re not alone.\u00a0"
