After retracing his footsteps on the continent many years later, he became passionate about ecology, tropical diseases and the natural environment."

Using knowledge gained in the field, our entomologists work with local authorities to monitor and manage risks and put in place strategies to minimise the opportunity for invasive species to become established in our towns and countryside."

As an entomologist at UKHSA, half of the time is dedicated to monitoring ticks which can transmit Lyme disease, now endemic in the UK, and the rest\u00a0 is concerned with mosquitoes and the pathogens they can carry."
