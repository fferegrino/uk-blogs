Location data will also be crucial for the future of mobility and next-generation transport networks with an estimated \u00a32 billion per annum (reference) to be unlocked from the better use of geospatial data in the transport sector."

They have demonstrated air quality improvements by increasing the effectiveness of low emission zones in Brighton and Hove. We asked\u00a0Josh Dalby to tell us more and to see if they will soon be in a town near you!"

It encourages more intelligent use of hybrid electric vehicles, which have limited zero-emissions range, to make sure that they have the lowest possible impact on air quality."

We have developed a smartphone app that communicates with an onboard diagnostics reader installed in the vehicle. We have demonstrated this system\u2019s effectiveness in influencing the driver to use the electric vehicle mode, reducing emissions within the most sensitive areas of the city."

Using post-processing and data analytics we are able to identify the optimum geofence zone for each vehicle, based on its geographical usage and capabilities in electric vehicle mode, to have the lowest possible impact on air quality. The optimum zone is pushed out to the app and it notifies the drivers when they are entering and leaving their zone."
