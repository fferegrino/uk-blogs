That is not correct - the Water Framework Directive is enshrined in UK law. For England, this means achieving Good Ecological Status for 75% of water bodies by 2027.\u00a0 The targets published yesterday work with existing targets to support them and fill any gaps, and are designed to be mutually reinforcing."

Our evidence strongly sets out that the new World Health Organization guideline level (published in autumn 2021 of 5 \u00b5g/m3) is not possible to achieve in many locations in England, due to the level of natural PM2.5 and pollution blown in from outside the country."

We are seeking views on a system of designations that allows for more direct accountability. The existing designation process already involves a level of ministerial involvement. \u00a0We have set out very clearly throughout the green paper our desire to maintain or enhance vital protections, which would support progress to halt nature\u2019s decline."

We are the first country in the world to set such a target for species abundance and are leading the way internationally. Tackling the decline in nature will be a huge challenge and require significant action to tackle impacts on biodiversity, including air and water pollution, invasive species and physical impacts on habitats, as well as proactively enabling recovery by creating more, better and joined up space for nature."

Any planting on farmland will be small comparison to the amount of land available and is likely to be on land of low agricultural value, with minimal impacts on our agricultural output. Through the food security review, we will be able to monitor the targets impact on agricultural output and take action if necessary."
