We put a tremendous amount of effort into learning from our customers, through open and candid discussions of the Industry Forum and other key stakeholder groups, by attending events where customers can feed back to us directly and conducting rolling surveys to gather views on a variety of topics. All of these engagements ensure customer voices are heard when key decisions are being made."

            "text": "On a regular basis, the Customer Insight team, which I head up, asks thousands of customers for feedback on the products and services we offer. Many hundreds of you take the time to respond by filling in our surveys or taking part in discussions, forums or focus groups to let us know how you feel, your opinions and the experience you have had. The feedback we look at comes from a variety of sources, and also includes complaints from customers."

We work to Market Research Society standards to ensure that results are presented in a non-biased, representative way and personal data is protected. Most importantly, the team ensures the customer\u2019s voice is heard and represented throughout every aspect of what HM Land Registry does."

            "text": "In short, no \u2013 the insight we gather from feedback is immensely valuable. As such, we don't just look at summary charts and percentages. A member of the team reads and categorises every single comment our customers make. The percentages give us the rough outline, but it's the words our customers write that provide the colour, painting a picture of how they view our services."
