Levels of damage vary, but mostly occur in cyclical years of population abundance driven by plentiful food. They can attack trees at any time but particularly late winter to spring, typically gnawing bark at the base of the stem. Trees may recover from minor damage but will die if ring-barked."

Unprotected young trees, particularly on the edges of plantations, can have buds and stems browsed. Bark can be stripped in the winter, particularly after snowfall."

            "text": "Deer are our largest wild mammals and can damage young trees by browsing, fraying and occasionally bark stripping. The larger herding species (red, fallow and sika) are more damaging because of their higher reach and greater feeding demand. Deer impacts are proportional to population size. Although trees may recover from minor browsing, more severe damage can stunt growth. Bark fraying and stripping can lead to wind-snap, secondary fungal infections and tree mortality."

Appropriately used, they can deter the smaller mammals and protect young trees from low densities of deer. However, the larger deer species can push shelters over and browse the trees inside. Shrub shelters are shorter and will not prevent deer browsing, but localised use of temporary netting can help until shrubs are established."
