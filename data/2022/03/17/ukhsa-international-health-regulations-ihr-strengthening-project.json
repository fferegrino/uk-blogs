I am a specialist in information and data analysis, and I have used this expertise to support public health research studies, including the evaluation of multiple health and other social sector related indicators and services.\u00a0I am also an experienced teacher, and have led trainings and workshops for public health professionals on bio-statistics, statistical software and research processes."

The event trained over 100 federal and provincial technical experts from across the country. These trainings were then cascaded to nine pilot districts across Pakistan, covering eight diseases. Since then, the training programme has expanded to cover 41 districts, covering 33 diseases. It\u2019s been exciting to be a part of this extensive growth journey over the past few years!"

On a professional level, I have been able to adopt innovative and creative approaches to tackle challenges around health data. Over the last three years, I have put a lot of energy into building strong relationships with government stakeholders and partners to facilitate the smooth running of the core functions of IDSR and sustainable data flow. It\u2019s been especially rewarding to support the roll-out of the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). This web-based data analytics platform allows public health actors to collect, analyse and present real-time health data on infectious diseases."

Over the years, our programme has grown, and we now have over 100 provincial IDSR data focal points across Pakistan. Initially, it was difficult to ensure the focal points regularly collected and submitted their data, which we rely on for accurate mapping and reporting. It was also challenging to engage the focal points in regular coordination calls. Over time, I\u2019ve developed a relationship with stakeholders based on trust and mutual understanding. Focal points now see the value of the data they are collecting firsthand, and they know they can rely on UKHSA for troubleshooting support."

Two years ago, I was in a tough personal situation which was adversely affecting my mental health. At the time, my supervisor prioritised my wellbeing, and sought to make my working environment as supportive as possible. I have lot of respect for UKHSA as an organisation, because it supported me when I needed it the most."
