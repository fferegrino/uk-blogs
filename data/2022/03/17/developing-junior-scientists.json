Hear about the experiences of one such scientist, Taylor Hanford, as he embarked on a PhD project taking him from our headquarters in Surrey to Brittany, France."

Throughout my teens, I kept my passion for animals alive and, in 2016, I graduated from Swansea University with a BSc in Biology. However, once my degree had finished, I was unsure of a career path and found a job at a factory in my hometown."

I quickly realised that I really enjoyed this work, which involved tasks such as culturing and identifying bacteria and measuring the effectiveness of products. It was through this work \u00a0that I recognised that I wanted to do a PhD and specialise in microbiology."

In the first couple of weeks I started planning my work with John Rodgers, my project lead at APHA \u2026 and then the pandemic hit! Prime Minister, Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown, and that people must work from home if they can. So, I packed a bag with two weeks\u2019 worth of clothes and went back to my family home in Wales. That lasted for six months."

I just settled for \u201cBonjour, \u00e7a va?\u201d (in a strong Welsh accent) and smiled and nodded at responses given, completely not understanding what was being said.
