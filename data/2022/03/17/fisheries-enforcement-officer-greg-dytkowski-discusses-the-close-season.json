            "text": "The close season runs from March 15th to June 15th inclusive and is a really important time for fish. Many will be preparing to spawn, spawning, or recovering from spawning, which can be both stressful and exhausting."

            "text": "For some anglers, the close season offers a chance to hang up their rods for a short time and for others, it provides an opportunity to mix up their routine and switch to canal and lake fisheries.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that\u2019s not always well understood with confusion sometimes arising around the dates and where the close season applies.\u00a0 In this blog, I hope to give you some background as to why it\u2019s there and how we enforce it."

This is something I am still passionate about as we want to encourage everyone to give fishing a go and help make fishing a sport that is inclusive and diverse."

            "text": "I\u2019m an angler myself and it\u2019s easy to ask, \u2018will I really impact spawning fish by going fishing\u2019? Yes, is the answer. If they are disturbed, they may well decide to stop. This is not only stressful for the fish but also means they\u2019ve lost their chance, not only this time, but for the whole year! Areas where fish spawn can also be open to damage, with eggs nestling directly in weeds, gravel, tree roots or even in your keepnet. Young fish, known as fry, that emerge from the eggs can be sensitive to silt disturbance, low oxygen and trampling."

            "text": "In fact, protecting spawning fish is so important there is separate legislation under section 2 of the Salmon and Freshwater fisheries act that makes it an offence to disturb spawning fish, or the areas they use."

            "text": "Day-to-day, I spend much of my time ensuring anglers have valid fishing licences and that they are following fisheries law. The service I and the rest of my colleagues provide is primarily funded by fishing licence income. Our work not only protects the sport of but enhances the wider work we deliver to enhance fisheries and promote fishing."

As part of Operation CLAMPDOWN, which is celebrating its 10th year in 2022, Angling Trust volunteers support our officers by being our eyes and ears on riverbanks and reporting incidents to our 24-hour incident hotline 0800 80 70 60."

            "text": "Ensuring rivers are not fished during the close season is a big priority for our teams. It helps protect our beloved coarse fish stocks and ensures spawning fish have the best chance to sustain their populations for the future. Coarse fishing in rivers, streams and drains as well as some canals and stillwaters within specified \u2018sites of special scientific interest\u2019 from 15th March to 15th June is an offence under Environment Agency National Bylaws and may land you with enforcement action and a fine upon conviction by the courts. The maximum fine is \u00a350,000"

        {
            "text": "The close season is chosen in this period to cover as many spawning species as possible to offer the most protection. If you do still want to get out, there are loads of places you can visit while this closure is in place such as many stillwaters and canals, depending on landowner agreement. You could even try your hand at trout fishing, though a valid fishing licence is still required."

            "text": "If you know anyone that\u2019s just started fishing for the first time, we ask that you not only remind them of the close season dates, but also explain why we enforce it. If you see fish spawning why not stop to watch them \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing sight! But please keep your distance and avoid disturbance of any kind. By staying back, you\u2019ll be able to watch their offspring spawning one day too."
