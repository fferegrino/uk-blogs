We used these artefacts to talk about the constraints we encountered and how we will or plan to overcome them. We then focused on the scope of the service, explaining our rationale and how we have worked in the open across government. We did this by hosting open show and tells with GDS and CDDO colleagues, blogging, attending cross-government design meet-ups and speaking to other Export Credit Agencies in New Zealand, Australia, Germany and Denmark to share learnings.\u00a0"

Working closely with UKEF\u2019s legal team, we learnt that the schemes are underpinned by a legal document \u2013 the Master Guarantee Agreement (MGA). It sets out criteria that the exporter must meet and uses specific legal terminology. Through interviews with banks, we found that the language was confusing and they were not sure what additional documents they needed to upload."

The new design gives users a specific list of documents they need to upload depending on what answers they give to the MGA criteria. We prototyped and tested this with users where they found it much easier and simpler to use."

We showed how the prototypes evolved through debtor and debt advice provider research sessions.
