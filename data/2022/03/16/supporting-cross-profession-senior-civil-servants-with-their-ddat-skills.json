I used to ask this question when running GDS Academy courses and we always got a range of answers, but mostly they focused on the technology (a laptop, smartphone etc). And we see many things in the press which talk about the digital skills of people being able to communicate or use internet based services via digital devices. But in the DDaT profession we see technology as the enabler: it really is all about people. First it is about the users who will use the services provided and many of us understand this well, but also it is about the individuals applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to people\u2019s raised expectations (as Tom Loosemore put it in the early days of transformation). And what is at the core of a digital culture? We try things, we take carefully calculated risks, we fail fast and learn so we can innovate."
