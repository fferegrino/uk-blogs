This why we are undertaking a comprehensive review of the SEND system \u2013 due to be published as a Green Paper by the end of March \u2013 alongside the Schools White Paper. I have been working closely with parents, children, teachers, leading experts and parliamentarians ahead of publishing both papers, and I urge you to provide your feedback on the proposals during the consultation period."

Having recently met with Matt Hancock MP to discuss the Private Members\u2019 Bill he introduced and what more we can do to support pupils with dyslexia, I confirmed that I am committed to the early identification of needs, including dyslexia, and ensuring that every young person receives the support they need to flourish. This is key to delivering the Government\u2019s ambitions on levelling up, and I am confident that through the Levelling Up White Paper, the Schools White Paper and the SEND Review, we can and will achieve this."

            "text": "We\u2019re supporting teachers too. It\u2019s important to remember that while we do have specialists, every single teacher in this country is a SEND teacher. We are determined to keep developing teachers\u2019 skills and confidence and promote evidence-based, effective practice within schools and other education settings. The revised Initial Teacher Training Core Content Framework and Early Career Framework, which all new entrants to the profession benefit from, have been designed around how to support all pupils to succeed, including those with SEND. The school workforce also has access to DfE-funded CPD, which provides resources to promote high-quality teaching for pupils with neurodiverse conditions. This has recently included piloting training to increase school staff confidence and capability in using assistive technology which can reduce or remove barriers for SEND learners."

Our SEND Code of Practice is clear that meeting the needs of pupils with dyslexia does not require a diagnostic label or test. Instead, we expect teachers to monitor the progress of all pupils, and put support in place where needed, for instance through statutory assessments that identify where pupils may be struggling with literacy."
