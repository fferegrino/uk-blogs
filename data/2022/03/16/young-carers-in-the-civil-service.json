It can be stressful and it\u2019s important we look after the wellbeing of all our young carers. We should also value the skills and experience which caring gives them. They bring a wealth of experience to the Civil Service and we need to take a pragmatic and empathetic approach to making the best use of their skills, including supporting their development and ongoing career progression."
