Transformation means many different things to different people, and if you work in government, you hear it spoken about a lot. What most organisations mean by transformation is changing how they work to make better use of the opportunities afforded by digital."

        {
            "text": "How this is done depends on the organisation, but it usually includes making services simpler to use and cheaper to run. Transformations in government tend to exist as programmes of work spanning a few years, and they mean a lot of change for everyone involved."

            "text": "The transformation I was part of in Homes England was often described as a \u2018user-centred transformation\u2019. This means that improving our users\u2019 experience of working with us was central to it. The purpose of Homes England is to make the housing market work better for people by making it easier for people to buy a new build home or for developers to develop affordable housing, and our users included actors across the entire housing sector. So, I want to share a few things that I picked up in the two years I worked there."

You should refer to your work in terms of the value it\u2019s adding, like \u2018reducing the risk of building the wrong thing\u2019 or \u2018making sure people use the thing we\u2019re making\u2019. This makes a massive difference in people\u2019s willingness to take your suggestions on board and makes you a better practitioner.\u00a0"

You\u2019re not there to \u201ctake people along on the journey\u201d, because that would imply that you know the destination. You don\u2019t, even if your business case says otherwise. The \u2018I know best\u2019 mentality among new joiners often leads to internal staff resenting transformation programmes."

Staff engagement is critical and co-designing change with colleagues most affected by it is crucial if you want your work to stick. You are unlikely to be a subject matter expert (yet!), so consider how you can include those that are in the design process."

Beyond an obsession with architecture, it\u2019s why I went to work for Homes England: housing is an incredibly complex system with decades-long feedback loops. It takes a long time to see the effect of your interventions and in comparison to other industries, it\u2019s uncharted territory for service design."

It will feel like going back to basics, and it means that skills like relationship management matter more than your ability to plan and facilitate a fantastic workshop every once in a while. It\u2019s about taking 1000 small actions, rather than 10 big ones."

        {
            "text": "This is slow work, and the way you measure success is different from how you would do it in a mature digital organisation. Find your leading indicators, such as a stakeholder talking about their funding stream as a service, and accept that it\u2019s likely to take a while before it\u2019s redesigned and users love it."

            "text": "Humans have a tendency to attribute fault to people and their personalities. In organisations, blame tends to be apportioned up the org chart. This is often right but is just as often unhelpful. When working on a transformation, consider things like political and organisational appetites for change: is the CEO on board? Is everyone going in the same direction? Does the organisation actually want it? Does it help meet any of our priority policies? These things can make or break your transformation and have very little to do with your individual performance. Transformations are complex, and grasping as much of their context as you can is key to staying sane and to recognising what\u2019s feasible."
