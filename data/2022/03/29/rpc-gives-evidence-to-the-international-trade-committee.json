These concerns were subsequently addressed by the department, so that we were happy to rate the final Australian FTA IA as fit for purpose. Our opinions on the FTA IAs are published transparently on our website."

Domestic IAs are intended to inform regulatory decision-making whereas FTA IAs seek to provide a sense of thinking behind negotiations and the potential impacts of the agreement. Because trade deals are complex with many assumptions, it is quite easy either to overwhelm the reader with too much detail or to present an over- simplified picture. We scrutinise these IAs to ensure a balanced picture presenting both benefits and costs of the trade deal objectively and in a way that clarifies the strengths and weaknessses of the evidence and models used."
