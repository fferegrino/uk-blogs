            "text": "The term \u2018neurodiversity\u2019 was coined in the late 1990s to describe brain   differences in areas such as attention, learning and sociability - which are normal, rather than weaknesses. Neurodiversity commonly refers to people with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia and other learning disabilities. Current estimates suggest that around one in seven of us in the UK is neurodivergent."

I\u2019ve always been hardworking, creative and passionate but spent a lifetime feeling chronically overwhelmed, struggling with structure, feeling my mind was on constant overload, and worrying that I wasn\u2019t reaching my full potential. After a year-long NHS process, I eventually got my ADHD diagnosis."

        {
            "text": "The current system is largely reliant on women with ADHD understanding their own traits and seeking a diagnosis. The problem is that the existing diagnostic criteria \u2013 the traits you need to identify \u2013 is still based on research that is biased towards boys and men. Yet girls and women don\u2019t always conform to that clinical picture and are often socialised to assimilate, and are likely to develop coping mechanisms which help mask the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

This is why it is important we have more conversations to create neuro-inclusive organisations."
