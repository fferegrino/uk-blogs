The appetite to adopt electronic signatures is there and growing. Many customers see the future in them, even after the pandemic. We are therefore keen to do what we can to improve and build on our work in 2020 and 2021 to facilitate the use of electronic signatures more widely within the conveyancing process, while also looking forward through 2022 and beyond."

            "text": "We were also really encouraged by the recently published findings of the Ministry of Justice\u2019s (MoJ) industry working group investigations into electronic signatures, in which the group voices support for the wider use of electronic signatures and our approach in issuing practice and guidance on the acceptance of electronic signatures. The report also recognises the potential for Qualified Electronic Signatures when underpinned by an identity verification process as part of a Digital Identity Trust Framework, such as that currently under development by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport."

We now refer to these kinds of signatures as \u2018Conveyancer-Certified Electronic Signatures\u2019. We have developed this name in collaboration with a cross-section of our customers. They tell us it serves as a useful reminder of the requirement to lodge a conveyancer\u2019s certificate confirming the step-by-step requirements have been met in the signing process."

This kind of signature is not currently widely used in the UK and the pilot has indicated that developments are required in the marketplace to make them simpler and more cost effective. For example, the wider use of digital identification to verify the signatory replacing face-to-face identification via a video call."
