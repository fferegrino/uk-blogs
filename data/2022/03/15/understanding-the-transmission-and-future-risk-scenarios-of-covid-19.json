We ensure that we gather the right information at the right time \u2013 and present this information clearly and accurately to inform public health decisions in response to emerging or ongoing threats of disease. This information, which can also be called epidemiological insights, also enables members of the public to make informed choices to help protect their own health and the health of others."

These data come from a range of sources, and provide a clear picture of where the disease may be spreading to inform measures to control it. Before the COVID-19 pandemic Public Health England \u00a0reported weekly flu surveillance data, gathered by multiple surveillance systems and indicating trends in influenza activity in the community, in primary and secondary care and among other settings, before and during the flu season."

Reporting near real-time data on key indicators such as COVID-19 case rates, hospitalisations, deaths and vaccine uptake has made it possible for people to see the impact of the pandemic in their own local area as well as at local authority, region, nation and UK level. The Dashboard also provides demographic metrics including case rates and vaccination uptake by age group at a local level and cases by age and sex."

Whilst the clinical risks were unknown, modelling was undertaken, using data on case numbers and evidence of the very high transmissibility of Omicron, to understand the potential spread of the new variant. This suggested that a rapid spread of Omicron could potentially have severe implications for public health as well as essential infrastructure and public services."
