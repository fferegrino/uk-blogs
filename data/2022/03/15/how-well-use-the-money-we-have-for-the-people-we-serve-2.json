We will use this money to build more new flood defences; to maintain our existing defences; to warn and inform people when flooding threatens; to respond to flood incidents and protect and support communities; and to provide planning advice to reduce flood risk."

We will get a total of \u00a344m capital and \u00a395m resource.\u00a0 While our core environment grant which funds our monitoring of the environment, enforcement of the regulations which protect it and response to pollution incidents will stay more or less the same, we will get a significant amount of new money on top of this. We will use that to step up our efforts to improve water quality, including by increasing the number of inspections we do of farms and sewage works - the two major sources of water pollution; to invest in our water transfer schemes which help reduce drought risk and in running our river navigations like the Thames; to improve air quality and biodiversity; to deliver the new post-Brexit chemicals regulations; to enhance our planning and placemaking work; and to support green finance."

We will use this to fund our regulation of industry which protects the environment and to deliver all the other services for which our customers pay, such as maintaining fisheries for anglers and operating river navigations for boaters. We also expect to receive \u00a3107m from our partners in other forms of funding to support our work to reduce flood risk in FY 22/23."

For example, the cost of maintaining our flood defences is rising sharply as we build more, as older defences come to the end of their design life, and as climate change does more damage to all of them."

            "text": "As far as possible we will address the gap between what we are being asked to do and the money we have to do it through continuous innovation and efficiencies. But like other public sector organisations we are having to make some difficult choices, including to reduce or stop activities for which we are not funded. \u00a0We are not, for example, funded to respond to every one of the 70-100,000 environmental incidents reported to us every year. So we will continue to focus on those which pose a significant risk to people or wildlife, while using the information from all the reports we receive to provide intelligence and inform our regulatory/enforcement activity even when we aren\u2019t able to respond actively to a particular incident."
