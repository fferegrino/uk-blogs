For me composting has always been about garden waste management in largely improvised forms, which happen to produce a great fertiliser - just by nature doing its own thing. But for this post for #CompostWeekUk I thought I\u2019d gather some research to share on the topic, alongside things I\u2019ve seen or tried myself."

These methods save having to move and apply the compost, as it\u2019s just where it needs to be once it\u2019s ready."
