We look at customers\u2019 requests relating to any changes that may be required to their land etc. The requests are processed by my team and some of them will result in mapping change request jobs which are created in LMS. These requests are sent through to our digitisers, as this is not something that is physically done within the Operational Mapping Team."

        {
            "text": "Ideally, my team would be able to ensure any mapping changes are processed, actioned, and resolved straight away, but this is not often the case. Sometimes the details of the submitted change requests are not always clear and we need to contact the customer for further clarification. A typical example could be that the customer sends in a plan with measurements that don\u2019t support the geometry annotated on their sketch map. In these cases, the digitisers are not able to complete the mapping because there are inconsistences with the customer\u2019s suggested mapping change. My team therefore resolves this issue by contacting the customer to determine what action we should take. Once we have received a response from the customer, we would pass this information on to the digitisers so they can make sure the mapping changes are implemented correctly. Once mapping requests have been completed, the changes are then published and can be shared with our other systems and made available to customers in Rural Payments."

Many of the areas I\u2019ve been involved have always had a very strong customer focus. One of my favourite roles was managing the Drop-in Centre (DiC), at the Reading Office for approximate six to eight weeks of the year. I did this duty diligently for about six/seven years. I managed a small group of approximate ten to 12 volunteers from different areas of the RPA who manned the centre. It was always hands-on, and great meeting customers and agents face to face."

It was wonderful to have direct contact with the customers. I met a lot of friendly people during the years of running the DiC and formed good relationships with the customers and agents and some of them have continued to contact me over the years to help them with their enquiries."
