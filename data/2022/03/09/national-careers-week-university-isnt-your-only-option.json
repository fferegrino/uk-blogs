The majority of my class were applying for different universities and attending open days, but I just remember sitting in a classroom and thinking that I\u2019m not sure if I want to do this for at least 3 more years. I wanted to put all the information I had learned during my A-Levels into practice. I didn\u2019t have much work experience so thought an apprenticeship would be a great way to get my foot in the door."

            "text": "I was also struggling with what subject to study at university. I really enjoyed business and law in college but neither subject was one that I could say \u2018I definitely want to do that for my career\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t interested in studying something I wasn\u2019t sure I would use in the future. That\u2019s another reason why I chose an apprenticeship because once you\u2019re in work, there\u2019s so many different departments and roles for you to experience."

            "text": "I was often told that I still needed to apply for university because apprenticeships were difficult to get but I knew I just wanted to start working and building a career. I applied for several different apprenticeships ranging from business apprenticeships, legal apprenticeships and even a few marketing apprenticeships. I had one apprenticeship at the top of my list though, a Civil Service apprenticeship. I remember spending hours preparing for my interview with one of my college tutors as I really wanted to join the Civil Service."

I immediately felt at ease working in the digital centre with such a positive team of people around me. It was tough getting to grips with the work that my team does, but they\u2019ve been really supportive throughout."

        {
            "text": "While completing my apprenticeship, I would typically spend 20% of the working week studying and the rest working. Every 6 weeks I would also have a full-day course for module-based learning, with an essay assignment after. It took me around 18 months to finish my apprenticeship, but it didn\u2019t seem that long really. It was still a relief to finish it though as I wouldn\u2019t need to do anymore 12,000-word essays!"

            "text": "I\u2019ve worked in different areas of the digital team, from arranging service teams assessments to testing new COVID-19 digital services to ensure they are accessible for the public. One of my favourite projects was working on the Accessibility Empathy Hubs. The purpose of the Empathy Hub is to help people understand the barriers that can exist for someone with a disability when using a computer, our digital services and in everyday life. There\u2019s various simulation equipment we have in place so we can better serve customers with a disability or impairment."

            "text": "I led the setup of the Empathy Hub in the Newcastle Delivery Centre for Global Accessibility Awareness Day in 2018. Since then, I have run various sessions with local councils and different communities within HMRC. Seeing the real-life impact of the work my team does has been inspiring, especially as I would have never thought about the accessibility of digital services before joining this team. Looking back now, my decision to do an apprenticeship was the best thing 17-year-old me did. Our team has set up another Hub in London and we\u2019re looking to launch more Hubs around the country, so I can\u2019t wait to get stuck in and develop my skills even further!"
