User-centred designers can connect with those promoting change across the broader system and vice versa. People can learn, connect and network across the public sector. And joining up can help us all deliver better public services and outcomes for citizens.\u00a0"

In the past, we\u2019ve run taster sessions around the different skills used in design, shared learning from work taking place, and promoted accessibility which we want to have as a big focus again this year. Services Week helps us explain to the organisation that digital is about more than technology. It\u2019s great to have the mix of work taking place across the country that you can hear about whilst providing a local focus.\u201d"

We want to understand what the whole journey looks like, identify who\u2019s working on what aspects of it, and highlight places where one team\u2019s work is dependent on information or services being worked on by other teams. We hope the session will help us build our knowledge of the system and make contact with others working on parts of the system relevant to what we\u2019re working on.
