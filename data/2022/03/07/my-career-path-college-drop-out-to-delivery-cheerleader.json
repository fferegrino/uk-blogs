            "text": "Having this insight allowed me to learn about digital professions and that not all roles in digital are necessarily \u2018techy\u2019 roles and in fact, I recognised I had many transferable skills that would map across to something like Product or Delivery and the more I learnt about Delivery Management and spent time shadowing DM\u2019s that just became the natural fit for me.\u00a0"

            "text": "I left school at 16 with a small handful of GCSE\u2019s, tried college but quickly decided it wasn\u2019t for me, and looking back now I realise that a traditional classroom based education has never been a good fit for me. I already had a Saturday job so I took on some extra hours and was placed in the office doing basic admin duties.\u00a0"

            "text": "This grounding then allowed me to start applying for full-time administration roles, at which point my mum, also a Civil Servant with 40 years of service! told me that the Benefits Agency was recruiting Admin Assistants. I worked in the Preston Income Support office for about a year, filing, photocopying and filling in milk tokens before I decided I\u2019d like to try something different. So I applied for an Admin Assistant role with the Prison Service at HMP Wymott but I didn\u2019t get it! The HR manager was not impressed with my F in GCSE Maths, I\u2019m not really sure why a GCSE in Maths was needed for filing prisoner records! But as it turned out the person they did offer the job to turned it down and I was next on the list."

            "text": "So that was the start of my career in the Prison Service and on 5th Jan 1998. I walked into a prison for the first time as an 18-year-old who wasn\u2019t even allowed her own set of keys! I gained a promotion to an Admin Officer and did lots of varied administrative roles before transferring to Prison Service HQ in London in 2000 and then leaving the service for a short time before returning to HMP Garth in 2002 when I moved back to Preston. I took another break from the service where I thought I\u2019d go and try something new with the NHS, but ended up returning to the Prison Service in 2006 back at Garth where I was promoted to Executive Officer and became the IT Manager. After a couple of years at Garth, I transferred to HMP Hindley as the IT Manager and it\u2019s from there that probably one of the first big changes of my career came along."

            "text": "The Prison Service was replacing its aged prisoner database with a system called Prison-NOMIS and they needed a cohort of national trainers to travel to all establishments and spend 6 to 8 weeks on-site delivering all the training modules to staff. I travelled around prisons for just over a year delivering training during the rollout, towards the end of the rollout a national application support team was established to provide 2nd line support to prison staff using NOMIS. I applied for an application support manager role based at HMP Kirkham and was\u00a0successful in gaining promotion to HEO. I remained in this role for 10 years and during that time the MoJ was established along with MoJ Digital in 2016. HMPPS Digital was established as part of MoJ Digital to begin the in-house building of digital services for the Prison and Probation\u00a0Service and alongside that to take on the responsibility for the eventual replacement of Prison-NOMIS."

I very quickly realised that Delivery Management felt like a natural fit for my skills and experience and I applied and was successful in becoming an Associate Delivery Manager in October 2020 before progressing to Delivery Manager in December 2021 and gaining promotion to a Grade 7.\u00a0"

            "text": "Personally, I don't believe you need any qualifications to be a Delivery Manager.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong there are lots of qualifications you can obtain, Certified Scrum Master for example, but these are not essential to ensure success as a DM. Everything you need you can learn on the job by spending time with people experienced in the role, by being an active member of your Community of Practice. Being a DM is about people, working with teams, bringing them together to be successful and to deliver. You need to be able to quickly tune into individuals' personalities so you can build a rapport and provide a team environment where everyone feels valued and safe and can concentrate their energies on delivery outcomes.\u00a0"

You need to be an advocate for your team and be confident in protecting your team from distracting noise from stakeholders or senior management that may\u00a0disrupt the focus on delivery. If there are any qualifications needed, they\u2019re not the ones you\u2019d gain in a classroom or by attending a course. They\u2019re the ones you pick up along the way through experience, by trying things and making mistakes and learning from them, by being a human being."

We\u2019re able to make tired and frustrating processes so much simpler for colleagues in front-line roles, to take away the pain of manual paper processes or wrangling a humongous spreadsheet. Hearing the feedback from users when they see a new digital service for the first time that\u2019s going to make their lives so much easier is the most exciting part."
