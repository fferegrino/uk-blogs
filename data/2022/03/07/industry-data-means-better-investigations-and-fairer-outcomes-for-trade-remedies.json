We are also obliged by law to respect the confidentiality of information.\u00a0 Again, if it were your information you\u2019d expect that too.\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s you, the people, who supply us with information who are in the best position to judge what\u2019s confidential in it and what\u2019s not."
