Inspired by this example, we gave our model the name in honour of the grey parrot. In this blog we are excited to tell you about it."

First, to find creative ways to help early career researchers contribute to reducing current evidence gaps that the civil service has identified using a low-cost, high-risk, high-reward model. Second, to incentivise those who want to generate impactful research by allowing them access to relevant policy questions."

Following this we made an enquiry via the Research Hub, with a director of an MSc programme to explore potential project collaborations and to trial something new- our Grey Parrot Model."

It educates them at an early stage in their careers about the delivery of research for policy. \u00a0The value to academia is that this self-contained model gives early career researchers experience in running a small-scale project that does two things: 1) produces high quality publishable research and 2) translates and communicates the work to policy professionals to identify where it could have impact. The value to the civil service is that the model utilises subject specific expertise to provides outputs that have been peer reviewed by experts."

Our role in setting up the model is to act as \u2018knowledge brokers\u2019 that translate knowledge from STEM to the civil service."
