The following few jobs were fitted around being a mum \u2013 party planning, arts, and crafts, in particular making paper flowers, all of which could be done at home."

I picked up a leaflet for a \u2018Women returners scheme\u2019, applied and was accepted on the course. I gained a computing and electronics qualification. This gave me what I needed to progress onto higher education."

The course included a year in industry where I did a placement in education \u2013 promoting IT across the national curriculum, working with schools and teachers teaching them how to use computers. I then studied for a Design and Technology Education Degree, specialising in resistant materials."

After this I began a one-year appointment working with the 'Women Returners\u2019 College\u2019, this time as a tutor delivering courses for women and young adults looking to gain IT skills. When that role ended, I decided to start contracting and was successful in gaining a software support role with the Royal Mail."

After three extensions to my contract, I became a permanent member of staff, and started the role of Service Team Leader managing the Service Desk call team. Shortly afterwards I gained a place on a management development scheme which included moving around roles on short term basis, something I really enjoyed and thrived on."

Two years later, I was the National Support Manager responsible for IT Service Delivery across nine regions of England and Wales. Not sure how that even happened!"

I once went through a difficult patch with a manager, we just couldn\u2019t get on the same wavelength. That was as much my fault as theirs. So, I sought out someone to talk to. In mentoring \u2013 the ball is in your court. You work with a mentor when you need support, or someone to bounce something off. I\u2019ve never had a mentoring experience that\u2019s not been positive."
