This day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress made towards achieving gender equality around the world. From the development of COVID-19 vaccines to the mitigation of climate change female scientists are making vital contributions to the world we live in. It is important to take this opportunity to celebrate the contributions women make to the science and engineering space and understand ways in which we can do more to support the empowerment of women."
