            "text": "The risk protection arrangement (RPA) was first introduced in 2014 to provide an alternative to commercial insurance for schools and academies. To date around 40% of all eligible schools have joined and are now benefiting from the reduced costs and administrative burden that the RPA provides. In a recent member survey 99.5% of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the service they receive."

            "text": "We constantly look to improve our support and when our members told us that cybercrime was an issue of concern and something they would like to see covered as part of the RPA, we launched a cyber pilot in collaboration with IASME, the National Cyber Security Centre\u2019s Cyber Essentials partner, to test how we could potentially help schools. The 12-month RPA Cyber Risk Pilot began in March 2021 and knowledge and information gathered from the 500 participating networks has been key in shaping the scope of the RPA cyber cover."

            "text": "For the 22/23 RPA membership year cyber cover will include increased cost of working for up to 90 days. The RPA will also be providing an Incident Response Service with a dedicated 24/7/365 Cyber Incident Breach Response hotline and email, as well as restoration, remediation and ongoing monitoring for cyber incidents."

            "text": "It took the school until September to have everything back up and running and the total costs were in the region of \u00a3180k. Without the insurance provided as part of the pilot these costs would have had to be met by the school."

Whilst Cyber Essentials isn\u2019t currently a condition for the RPA Cyber Cover, we are actively encouraging schools to work towards achieving Cyber Essentials as it is an industry baseline for cyber security."

            "text": "So why should you make the move to RPA if you\u2019re not already a member? You will certainly benefit from reduced costs in comparison to commercial insurance. The membership cost for 2022/23 will be \u00a321 per pupil for local authority maintained schools from 1 April 2022 and for academies from 1 September 2022. The cost of the RPA is reviewed annually to ensure breadth of cover and value for money are balanced but the annual membership cost is fixed for all members, regardless of risk and claim history."

        {
            "text": "You will also benefit from the reduced administrative burden of RPA. Joining RPA is simple and takes less than 5 minutes. There are no forms and RPA operates on a no material fact disclosure basis, so we don\u2019t need estate, buildings or contents valuations and we don\u2019t review your schools risk rating. There is also no annual renewal process \u2013 your membership will just roll over to the next year."

            "text": "If the worst happens and you need to make a cyber claim, we have a range of support designed to simplify the claims process for you. You can call the 24-hour 365-day emergency helpline to start the process and you\u2019ll be provided with a named account manager to help you through the claims process, plus access to a dedicated portal for claims handling. Subject to the conditions being met and consequently a valid claim, we will provide expert loss adjusters and legal advisers and the incident response service may determine that on-site support is appropriate."
