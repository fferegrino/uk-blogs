It\u2019s important that I recognise how unconscious biases shape the way I view the world and affect my decision making, as well as the way I perceive and interact with others. This extends to what I can do to overcome my biases to ensure that I don\u2019t create a negative experience for others.\u00a0\u00a0"

And this change needs to start within ourselves. I knew that I had to create my own change and take control of my own career.\u00a0"

Organisation need to step up by mitigating the impacts of unconscious gender bias by doing more to understand the barriers that hold women back and prevent them from progressing and advancing into leadership roles. For example, women returning to their careers after a period of paternity or maternity leave.\u00a0"

For example, the domestic obligations of men are often less compared to women, particularly working mother, this can make it easier for men to be available take roles and be more geographically mobile. Another example is around unconscious bias thinking on the term senior leaders, the perception is that often people automatically think of male leadership.\u00a0"

Having said that, I believe more can be done to identify the barriers that are still holding us back so that we can break the bias. I believe that each of us can make an impact on how things evolve. We can be bolder and facilitate discussion to help unpack the more qualitative issues that matter to women, engage men in the conversation on the issues that women face as well as explore what we can do to foster gender equity at work.\u00a0"

This can create a ripple effect on morale, teamwork, commitment and performance."

I believe a big part of diversity is acknowledging that we are all different. So, in my opinion women must not feel that we must be honorary men. Rather we should be able to succeed and contribute to better workplaces by being ourselves and bringing in the masculine and feminine qualities. Taking in talent with different ideas in the workplace can be a great formula for an innovative environment.\u00a0"
