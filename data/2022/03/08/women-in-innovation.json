It was important to ensure there was diversity across panel members, as each member could bring along their own valuable insights to maximise our chances of success.

            "text": "Diversity and inclusion (D&I) principles are about respecting the unique needs, perspectives and potential of everyone and respecting people\u2019s contributions equally. By incorporating wider perspectives when brainstorming and problem solving, we can avoid the formation of \u2018groupthink\u2019 \u2013 a psychological phenomenon\u00a0that occurs within a\u00a0group of people\u00a0in which cohesiveness and the desire for harmony\u00a0in the group results in a dysfunctional\u00a0decision-making\u00a0outcome. Ultimately, this can lead to a sub-optimal outcome and can affect the type of policies that are delivered to the public. D&I is not only essential for policymaking but can also be a key driver behind innovation."

The Harvard Business Review found from their analysis that diversity unlocked innovation and drove market growth, a finding which they felt should compel efforts to ensure senior ranking officials \u201cembody and embrace the power of differences\u201d. Similarly, McKinsey & Company analysed 1,000+ firms across 12 countries\u00a0and found that executive teams in the top quartile for ethnic and cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform those in the bottom quartile. Finally, Boston Consulting Group (BCG)\u00a0surveyed the innovative potential\u00a0of 1,700 companies in eight countries and found that firms with above-average diversity produced a greater proportion of revenue from innovation (45% in total) than firms with below-average diversity (26%)."

A positive attitude and encouragement are needed in fostering entrepreneurial mindsets and collaborative sprits within the innovation community, so that the cross-pollination of ideas, technologies and experiences from diverse disciplinaries and sectors can thrive in incubating new businesses."

But I\u2019ve found that, irrespective of sector, the questions for technology translation remain the same - what is the market need, the market size, IP position, competition, time and cost to market etc. We should be focusing on technology pull, and not technology push."

            "text": "Catherine Quinn: My own experience of innovation was in no way deliberate or planned, but came about serendipitously through finding myself working at Oxford University in the early 1990s, when the University was just beginning to explore the opportunities to commercialise ideas emerging predominantly from the Sciences and Engineering. It was the days of Oxford's first major spin-out companies, when the process was handled through the office I began to work for in 1991, and long before the University's knowledge transfer firm really got going. It was a dynamic decade at Oxford, when the foundations for IP commercialisation were created, and it provided amazing opportunities for learning how academic knowledge could be translated for practical application and societal benefit. I ended up leading the service I had joined as a novice, and working in partnership with Isis Innovation (as it was back then - now Oxford University Innovation) - one of the most successful academic innovation companies in Europe. I want women to understand that experts in innovation develop through many and various complementary types of experiences.\u00a0There is no single starting point for success. Thirty years later, and having decided to move to a portfolio career, my early experience of working in innovation has translated into some fascinating non-executive opportunities on the Boards of 'BEIS family' organisations such as The Met Office and The National Physical Laboratory; the Copyright Licensing Agency; and, most recently, CPI Ltd - Centre for Process Innovation (part of the Advanced Manufacturing Catapult)."

            "text": "Yupar Myint: It\u2019s important to allow innovators to take risks and be proactive even in small projects \u2013 and to recognise this risk taking. Alongside this, by gaining experience, from both successes and failures, will help as evidence builds of entrepreneurial mindset, energy, ability to both spot opportunities and take tough commercial decisions. It is important that the innovators can access resources (including personal development opportunities) they need in creating new opportunities. From the idea creation followed by the commercialisation process, the heart of success is the innovator and the team. Give innovators the access to training opportunities where they can hone their skills, get them to work directly with entrepreneurs and tech investors who are used to evaluate disruptive innovations. The ability to create ideas which are deeply rooted in customer and market needs, clearly understand IP implications, the ability to articulate a commercial plan with financial and internal resources implications, are key areas of competence for success."

It is better that your mentor is not your direct supervisor or boss but you can find your mentor within or outside your organisation. You can have more than one mentor, someone with domain expertise and someone with personal coaching skills that meet your career ambitions. There are so many people out there willing to make their time to help and share experiences!"

Networking can sometimes be seen in a rather negative light by people who think it may be exploitative, superficial or just not their \u201cthing\u201d.\u00a0 This is missing the point that among the resources needed to implement innovation is the knowledge, experience, expertise, energy, connections that people have in the wider environment. Networking is part of developing your social capital and constantly building relationships. Building your social capital is a subtle process, highly dependent on trust and reciprocity, takes time and is your lifetime asset."
