You will have seen on the news the amazing kindness of women (and families in general) in neighbouring countries like Poland, offering their homes as safe havens to those fleeing the conflict. In these situations, there is no bias, criteria or hidden agenda, just heartfelt expressions of compassion and the recognition of a universal truth: we are all human and we all need help sometimes."

Whatever our gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity or beliefs, what unites us as women \u2013 as human beings \u2013 is our belief in a better world for everyone."
