More needs to be done to create a level playing field, such as ensuring we have true diversity on recruitment panels and visibility of women and ethnically diverse people across all channels.\u00a0"

The early part of my career in the Department for Work and Pensions really shaped my leadership style as you are responsible for quite a lot at a junior grade, but people often forget about the transferrable skills they have at junior grades that would benefit them for a career in project delivery."

Show colleagues who aspire to progress their careers that it can be done while being your authentic self. Authenticity is a very important part of leadership in my view and I actively promote that idea. As soon as you start trying to act in a way that is not natural to you, that is when things go wrong. It's important to be relatable, human and compassionate as well as competent and skilled."
