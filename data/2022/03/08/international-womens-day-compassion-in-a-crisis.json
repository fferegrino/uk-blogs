            "text": "Only the most cynical would say we have made little progress towards a more equal, open and understanding society. While social, economic and ethnic inequalities remain and must continue to be challenged, in our schools, communities and statute books, there is much greater acceptance of the diversity of the human experience \u2013 one not limited by sex, class, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation."

            "text": "For many reasons, not least lingering stereotypical attitudes around \u2018girl and boy jobs\u2019, social care and social work remain female dominated professions (around 80%). Regardless of societal circumstances, recognition of - and just reward for - women\u2019s contribution to the health and social care sector, both as paid workers and unpaid carers, is vital."

            "text": "As we watch the tragedy of the Russian Ukraine war unfold on the borders of Europe, many women are finding themselves cast into these roles, but in ways they could not have anticipated, even a few weeks ago. Mothers, wives, partners, daughters, girlfriends - I salute them, as I do all Ukrainians and good Samaritans in neighbouring countries doing what they can for the distressed, displaced and dispossessed."

            "text": "More than four years ago, I hosted two blogs from Liz Hughes, a qualified social worker, on helping residents survive, process and rebuild after the trauma\u00a0 of the Grenfell Tower blaze. She was working in a London borough as Head of Service for Prevention and Care Management at the time. She wrote at length of her experiences reconnecting with practice skills to help those whose lives had been turned upside down by an event they hadn\u2019t anticipated or had any control over."

            "text": "As we mark International Women\u2019s Day, fairness and justice for women, the upholding of their human rights and their equal inclusion in all aspects of society has never been more essential. The women of Ukraine, indeed of any nation under siege by those who would seek to marginalise, stigmatise and destroy, are an inspiration to us all."
