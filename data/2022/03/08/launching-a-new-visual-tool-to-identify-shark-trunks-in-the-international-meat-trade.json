As well as being available in processed form such as fillets, shark meat is also traded as whole-body trunks, which can be headless, finless or both. Officials tasked with verifying if trunks are a species of shark which is listed on the Convention of the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) voiced concerns about the lack of visual identification guides to support this challenging requirement during the opening phase of our Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund project."

            "text": "This trunk guide is being launched as part of a three-guide series that covers whole animals, shark trunks and dried products such as shark fins and devil ray gill plates. The whole animal and product guides combine decades of previous work and have been developed as part of a global collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other partner and funding organizations (including the CITES Secretariat, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the European Union, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and Shark Conservation Fund). These guides simplify the training process for customs officials by covering all CITES listed species, and the major products in trade in one set of guides."
