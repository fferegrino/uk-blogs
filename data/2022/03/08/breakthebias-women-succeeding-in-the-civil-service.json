I want to support colleagues to reach their potential, particularly women, encouraging them to have the confidence to take up new roles or new challenges.\u00a0 I feel that it is often confidence rather than knowledge or experience that stands in our way as women. We need to give ourselves the permission to succeed, take up opportunities even when they feel a bit scary in the knowledge that we have a community of people behind us rooting for our success."

We take gender equality very seriously and, as senior leaders, we are in a position to create a positive working culture that supports diversity of thought and innovation. Alongside me, Ivana Gordon heads up our digital transformation teams and Lucia Webster heads up the new online service to help people find and apply for grants. We want to support women of all grades at every stage of their career.\u00a0"

This includes flexible working (I work part time) and office locations around the UK to attract local talent and reduce travel times (I\u2019m based in London, Ivana is based in York and Lucia in Glasgow). I\u2019m also focusing on wellbeing to ensure the team has support to achieve the work/life balance they aspire to. We run a monthly staff survey to monitor stress levels and then we discuss how we can prioritise workloads as a team."

I\u2019ve had many years experience chairing meetings, working with directors across government, having difficult conversations and briefing ministers. Preparation is key. Think about the messages you want to land in advance of the meeting and, if it helps, try them out in a safe space with others. Give yourself the permission to own your views. Don't be apologetic. Take your time and simply call people out if they try to take over. You will be amazed at the impact you can have.\u00a0"

I have seen - too often - women are not prepared to step into a new role until they feel they tick all the boxes. This may mean missing out on chances and opportunities. At GGMF we have introduced a mentoring scheme to provide support, so women have a space where they are comfortable to discuss ideas and challenges they face. I have benefited from being mentored by some truly inspiring women, each with very different careers and having made different life choices. They have all helped build my confidence and self belief, provided me with a great sounding board and a safe space to try out new ideas and develop my thinking."
