It has meant that I can manage my condition easily while not missing out at work. The move to digital hubs has also been fantastic. As I'm based in Leeds, it's given me a lot more choice about what work I do and what projects I can be involved in.\u00a0"

However, here I've felt included since the very beginning. Although there aren't as many women as we'd like in some of the more technical teams, I'm never treated as the odd one out and actively encouraged to get more involved and take on more responsibility by those around me. Senior leaders have regularly asked for my feedback, and I've felt comfortable to be honest even when my feedback is negative as I know it will be listened too and acted on.\u00a0"

I've influenced how my teams are structured, what the product manager role looks like, and I am helping to set up the profession in the technical services space. At the beginning of my career, this is an exciting opportunity to challenge myself and build experience."

This ethos helps our colleagues play important societal roles outside work, including caring for children or the elderly. Recent work to enable \u201chybrid working\u201d options have introduced still more flexibility for our workforce."

            "text": "We are committed to developing a more gender-diverse workforce, particularly in STEM roles. Institutional mindsets can be a barrier and are a major reason that we see fewer women in technical roles.\u00a0 It can be all too easy to allow traditional stereotypical gender roles in society to drive assumptions about women at work and as leaders. I believe that to address these imbalances we need to start at the earliest levels of education and further enforce these changes in schools and universities. That said, we are lucky in MoJ to have a number of great female role models in our technical and senior leadership teams.\u00a0\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "There is a perception that working in a government technical team can mean working with outdated tech, with a laid-back approach, in male-dominated teams. That is certainly not the case at MoJ. Our Technology Services are well maintained, we have diverse multidisciplinary teams, and can compete with the best of large enterprises. We are continuously adapting to new ways of working."
