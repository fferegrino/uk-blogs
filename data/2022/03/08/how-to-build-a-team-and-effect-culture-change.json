It\u2019s an exciting time, and we\u2019ve been busy recruiting additional roles to help deliver change. However, this doesn\u2019t come without its challenges. We have to think about how we continue to grow these capabilities locally and embed a user-centred design culture across the organisation."

Time was spent producing business cases and implementing third-party systems with limited user satisfaction. So, inspired by the work that the change agency FutureGov were doing, the mission was set to introduce user-centred design to help improve services, bring creativity, and provide a different way to deal with budget cuts."

Although the ICT function in the council initiated \u2018digital\u2019, I didn\u2019t want technology to be the focus of the change activity."

The service team saw an improvement in customer satisfaction and their relationship with their customers. The other demonstrated our organisation\u2019s challenges, which is about changing culture. It highlighted the need to manage managers\u2019 expectations around discovery outputs and delivering minimum viable products."

As a manager of the new digital design team, the timing was interesting. It meant people were keen to re-skill, and there was a sense of urgency. But it was difficult in terms of the broader digital strategy work to get investment, commitment, and there was uncertainty of the future for people."

There are 30 people in the digital team: business partners, architects, web managers, content designers, service design managers, service designers, service improvement analysts, and user adoption roles. User research is incorporated into content and service design roles, but a dedicated post would be helpful.
