The world of Digital and Technology can be pretty baffling with lots of alienating technical jargon.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been working in the Digital and Technology world for the last four years and love it but have learned that once you manage to crack the code, it turns out that not all of that language is appropriate or acceptable in today's world.\u00a0\u00a0"

With it being International Women\u2019s Day, it has made me reflect on the language we use and the different ways people of different genders interact, such as us rarely commenting on what men wear."

The word \u2018mansplaining\u2019 has entered our vocabulary - where typically a man explains something to a woman in a condescending way.\u00a0 These situations make me feel uncomfortable and if I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t always have the confidence to challenge them.\u00a0"

            "text": "Language that has negative racial connotations must be challenged. Recognition of racism in language is an essential stepping stone to a coherent response in challenging abusive language.\u00a0 An example is the phrase black listing - instead we should use unacceptable listing - which is a much clearer explanation for these lists.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to understand the origin of words to understand why they are no longer acceptable.\u00a0"
