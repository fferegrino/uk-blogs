You could also undertake a disease risk assessment, or get personalised nutritional advice, all from the comfort of your own home. There are even third-party databases where you can upload your raw genomic sequence and receive an analysis of a variety of traits and risks in addition to those provided by the company you initially used."

DTC testing lets the public engage directly with genomics, offering them the excitement of finding out about their genetic make-up. It promises to unlock what your genome might tell you about your identity, disease risk and overall health. However, the rise in DTC genomic testing also comes with some risks."

            "text": "It is fuelling the rapid accumulation of the public\u2019s genomic data by international private companies, raising issues around ownership, privacy, and consent. Also, if your genomic test uncovers a hidden hereditary health condition, or casts doubt on your true parentage, then this has implications for your relatives too - whilst your genome is unique, parts of it are intrinsically shared with your biological family and ancestors. You share 50% of your genome with your parents and siblings, 25% with each grandparent, and 12.5% with a first cousin. Once you have your genetic sequence, you can share it with a third-party database, exposing part of your relatives\u2019 genomic information to further scrutiny, without their knowledge or consent."

For example, in the US, they have used third-party genomic databases to identify criminals by uploading DNA sequences from crime scenes and uncover suspects through distant relatives. In the case of the \u2018Golden State Killer\u2019, investigators identified the perpetrator James DeAngelo via his third cousins, who shared a great great-grandparent and had uploaded their genomes to an online database (2). This approach is now solving many cases per year in the US, and some other countries are adopting similar tactics."

However, the UK\u2019s major health and research databases have stated that they will not allow the police to access the data they hold unless forced to do so by the courts. Should solving crimes trump people\u2019s right to privacy, and control over their genetic information?"

It also explores issued beyond these, and looks at how genomics might impact sectors as diverse as criminal justice, education, and sport, and why people should think about the role that genomics could play in their future."
