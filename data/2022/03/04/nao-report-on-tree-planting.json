            "text": "Today the National Audit Office has published a report on Defra\u2019s tree planting progress and the success of the Nature for Climate Fund (NCF)-funded Tree Programme so far. The NCF Programme was set up to deliver the Government\u2019s landmark England Trees Action Plan in order to achieve its target of at least 7,500 hectares of annual tree-planting by the end of Parliament."

            "text": "The report acknowledges that Defra has made significant progress under challenging circumstances to launch multiple new grant schemes since the launch of the Programme, but also claims Defra is unlikely to meet this years\u2019 tree planting target and raises questions about the long-term planning and monitoring of future planting schemes."

            "text": "Coverage in\u00a0The Times, The Telegraph and the Independent reports on the NAOs\u2019 assessment that progress towards the ambitious planting target is being hampered by reluctance among landowners to commit land for planting, a shortage of foresters, risks of seed and sapling shortages, and delays by the Forestry Commission in approving applications for planting grants."

            "text": "The NAO underplays the amount of tree-planting that will take place from other government-funded schemes this year, in addition to Nature for Climate Fund planting and privately-funded tree-planting. A number of government funded schemes that pre-date the NCF are still planting high volumes of trees this year and we forecast that when all government funded tree-planting is taken into account, between 2,200 and 2,900 ha of government funded tree planting will take place in 21/22, in comparison to 1,800 ha of government funded tree planting in 20/21."

            "text": "Our tree planting pathway is consistent with the Climate Change Committee\u2019s advice on meeting net zero. The target is ambitious but achievable \u2013 over\u00a06000ha/year was planted as recently as the 2000s, and in the England Trees Action Plan we have a more ambitious agenda on trees now than we did then. Our programme plan anticipates a year-on-year increase in tree planting as grant funding proposals are delivered."

The NAO report acknowledges that we have worked at pace in difficult circumstances to rise to this challenge but we are under no illusion that there is more to do.

By taking up grants such as the England Woodland Creation Offer now, farmers and landowners\u202fwill be able to transfer into a future environmental scheme at agreed points without having to repay their current funding."
