            "text": "Alongside our partners, Natural England is involved in a number of initiatives to support the recovery of hen harriers in England, including satellite tracking birds to investigate patterns of dispersal and survival. In this blog, we will share the latest update on tagged birds monitored by Natural England and explain the approach we take when a tag stops transmitting. We will also share as much information as we can on current investigations into confirmed hen harrier deaths."

            "text": "What does it mean when a tag stops transmitting? \nSatellite tags on hen harriers are powered by small solar panels. If a bird dies and the solar panel is no longer exposed to light, tags gradually stop transmitting until the battery drains completely. Natural mortality is high for juvenile hen harriers, especially in winter, and natural causes of death include predation, starvation and disease. However, illegal persecution on land managed for grouse shooting remains the main threat to the recovery of hen harriers, and Natural England research has found high rates of tag failure on grouse moors. Tags can stop transmitting due to malfunction or if they reach the end of their life, but are generally reliable."

            "text": "Therefore, when a bird goes missing, we always consider the possibility that it could have been illegally killed. When a tag stops transmitting, Natural England staff communicate with the police, scrutinise the\u00a0data received from the transmitter, and attempt to retrieve the bird. This is not always straightforward, as the final transmissions from the tags do not always give a precise location. If a dead bird is retrieved, a post-mortem examination is carried out, normally by our partners at the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London (ZSL). It is crucial in taking these steps that we are careful about what information is released, and when, as we do not want to risk compromising any criminal investigation carried out by the police."

As part of this commitment, Natural England is supporting the National Wildlife Crime Unit via the secondment of a full-time staff member working on tackling raptor persecution. When birds die, we aim to publicly share as much information as we can, without compromising any potential criminal investigation."

            "text": "Since the last update in November 2021, tags on six birds have stopped transmitting; at this stage, we don\u2019t know what has happened to them, but the birds are assumed to have died. These include the wild-reared juveniles Val, Percy, Jasmine, Ethel and Amelia, hatched in 2021, and the adult brood-managed bird R2-F1-20, hatched in 2020. The locations of the last satellite tag fixes are given in the update, although accuracy may be low, so the location of the last fix could be many kilometres away from the actual location of the bird. Despite searches, at present we have no further evidence to indicate whether they were lost due to normal over-winter causes of mortality such as starvation or predation, or to illegal killing. The tag data do not indicate that the satellite tags malfunctioned."

Since then, we have received the full results of the post-mortem examinations, and are able to share the following summaries:"

            "text": "We have shared these findings with the police, who have reviewed all the facts, considered the history of the sites where the birds were found, and judged that, based on the information provided and available to them, there was no evidence to suggest any offences had been committed. Our presumption, therefore, is that these birds died due to natural causes. As these individuals were part of the brood management trial, these results will also be reviewed during the brood management evaluation. Four of the seven 2021 brood-managed juveniles are still alive and being tracked as of February 2022."

This is a different bird to the ones sent for post-mortem examination mentioned above. We are aware of public interest in this case, but, at present, Natural England has been asked by the police to not comment publicly. Investigations are led by the police and their timeframes will vary. Our top priority at this time is to ensure this investigation is not compromised, but we commit to sharing the full facts of Natural England\u2019s involvement this case when we are informed that the investigation has reached a stage at which this would be appropriate."

The wording has been corrected upon our request to say that she \u2018could have been shot away from the estate before flying on to it\u2019."
        },
        {
            "text": "We want to clarify that no further information has come to light about this case. At the time, ground-breaking work by ZSL and Natural England confirmed that Betty was shot, using electron microscope techniques to show that metal had been propelled into her leg, and to detect the composition of metallic residues undetected by conventional x-rays. Whilst this proved Betty was shot, the leg injury was not thought to have been immediately fatal. It is thought that Betty could have flown to her last known location, and the location where she was shot is still unknown."

            "text": "Looking to the future \nWe are grateful to all the groups and individuals we work with for helping us gather the best information we can on what happens to tagged birds. It\u2019s always hard to hear about the deaths of individual hen harriers, but as with all wild birds it is expected that some will not survive, and it is vital that our future conservation work is based on sound evidence. We welcome the promising increase in breeding hen harriers in northern England, and are hoping to see a further increase in breeding numbers in 2022."
