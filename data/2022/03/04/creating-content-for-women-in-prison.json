The 'Your profile' area gives prisoners visibility over their timetable, visits, incentive level and money. Research has shown repeatedly how important some 'agency' over these things is."

As a result, women are often many miles from home. And often many miles from their children. Women make up around 5% of the prison population. Women are more likely to serve shorter sentences than men, and trauma can often play a big role in their lives."

They take people\u2019s trauma into account to avoid triggering reactions or re-traumatising them, and they adjust the behaviour of staff to support a person\u2019s coping capacity.

We worked on the idea of self-serve content: tiles that could be clicked on to access content. This is the kind of information that could be googled on the outside, but not in prison. Women might feel embarrassed or want to explore periods, breast-checking, sexual health and the menopause, on their own. In prison, they can't do this."

The nurse shared questions women ask about the procedure, and we created content shaped by this which worked well, when tested."

They\u2019ve shared their experiences around these topics, so that other women can learn from them. This will be specific audio content on the Hub from women who have valuable experiences to share about how they\u2019ve coped in prison."
