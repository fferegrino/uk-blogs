Not only does it seek to create a seamless, integrated system with people\u2019s needs at its heart, it will also empower NHS colleagues and their social care counterparts to make the most of new and existing career paths."

For example, through more learning experiences in social care, including health undergraduate degree programmes, apprenticeships, or the potential introduction of integrated skills passports, allowing you to transfer skills and knowledge between the NHS, public health and social care."

A major step forward will be the use of care records, shared across health and social care, for every person, and digital tools that allow individuals to book appointments, order prescriptions and communicate more easily with those providing their care. This will provide the foundations for more joined up direct care, planning and population health."
