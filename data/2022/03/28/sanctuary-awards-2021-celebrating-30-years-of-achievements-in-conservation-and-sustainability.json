Since 2006, Nigel has led a team of volunteers on \u2018Project Ubique\u2019, helping to balance military training requirements with public access on Salisbury Plain Training Area. Nigel\u2019s efforts continue to make a real difference to those who visit and train on Salisbury Plain, and it was a special moment to see him presented with this well-deserved award in recognition."

[Copyright British Army]I was also delighted to see Op CORDED win this year\u2019s Sustainable Business Award. Funded by Defra, the operation has helped to tackle the illegal wildlife trade in Malawi, Sierra Leone, Gabon, and Zambia. It was inspiring to learn how personnel from 1st Battalion, Irish Guards and the Military Intelligence Corps have shared their knowledge and skills to help deliver economic development and empower local communities in Sub-Saharan Africa."
