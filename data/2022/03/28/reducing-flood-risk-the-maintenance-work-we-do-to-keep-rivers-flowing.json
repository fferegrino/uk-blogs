We are not responsible for clearing of general debris from rivers, however, we can act where it could pose a flood risk."

We cleared urban debris from one screen that could have caused a serious blockage. At the same time we could confirm our other screens were clear and didn\u2019t require attendance, which reduces our carbon footprint from driving between sites and allows our team to concentrate on maintaining and operating our key assets."
