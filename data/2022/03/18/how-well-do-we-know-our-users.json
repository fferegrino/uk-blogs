This week we heard from a Service Owner in the Office of the Public Guardian who is working hand in glove with digital colleagues to transform the way in which his services are delivered."

Which reminded me of a weeknote that I wrote the last time I visited a prison, which I\u2019d like to share (some of) with you."

The governor and team are really enthusiastic about Digital and Technology, understand the change we can help them drive, and are complementary about working with us. But despite all of this, as we were walking around the prison and speaking to people, I began to wonder how much we really understand our users."

That there might be 8 prison officers using the same desktop device on a wing so nobody really feels responsible for the kit? That offenders might walk into the office and see what\u2019s on that device? That a prison officer is more likely to swap their desktop with someone else\u2019s if it stops working rather than call the service desk to save time (including carting it all the way across a prison through locked doors)?"
