            "text": "However, the air flow within a thunderstorm system is thought to be important. Thunderstorms form when warm wetter air on the earth\u2019s surface is beneath much cooler air higher in the atmosphere. The warm air rises quickly (known as up-draft) which causes the cool air to flow down towards the ground (known as down-draft). As the warm air rises, it cools and the moisture condenses into clouds and water molecules."
        },
        {
            "text": "As the cold air (down-draft) falls to the ground, increasing pressure generates a strong cross wind on the surface. This surface wind blows across grass and plants, picking up pollen grains and fungal spores (tiny biological particles by which fungi reproduce), which are carried on air currents. This is thought to be the reason why more pollen is in the atmosphere during a thunderstorm than you might expect."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is then hypothesised that the pollen and/or spores are caught in the up-draft and get pulled up into the clouds and storm system. The excess moisture in the clouds enter into the pollen grains and fungal spores causing them to break apart into smaller granules and/or other particles. Rain then brings the tiny micro-particles down from the clouds to ground level where the micro-particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing breathing problems."

Allergy UK suggest that 10-30% of adults and as much as 40% of children suffer from allergic hay-fever in the UK.\u00a0 There is therefore a significant susceptible population of otherwise potentially healthy individuals who may be affected by thunderstorm asthma."

        {
            "text": "Climate change may also increase the likelihood of such events. While there is limited evidence that changes to the climate will bring about more intense and frequent thunderstorms, there is good evidence that earlier and longer growing seasons may lead to higher concentrations of aeroallergens such as grass pollen.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t stop there, however; increased CO2 concentrations have been linked to an increased spore count of allergenic fungi (Alternaria alternata) and increased atmospheric pollen."
        },
        {
            "text": "Therefore, a combination of increased growing periods with favourable weather conditions, plus higher levels of CO2 from human activities is likely to increase the risk of thunderstorm asthma events in the future. In addition, there is evidence that interactions of pollen and air pollution can potentially increase the potency of the allergic reaction of susceptible individuals."
