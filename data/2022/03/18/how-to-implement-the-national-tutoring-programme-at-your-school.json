For this academic year, we chose to provide tuition for our year 10 and 11 students, with the aim to support them in preparing for their summer exams. We then outlined the selection requirement and sent these details to the subject teams. I recommend that you take the time to ensure groups are set up appropriately in tutoring sessions based on level, gaps, and topic need.\u00a0"

The difference in student engagement when parents and carers have been involved and engaged has been huge. For example, we sent an ePostcard which included key information, to parents and carers prior to their child starting tuition. We then reinforced their involvement up to and during the programme. \u00a0"

We regularly update all staff via the school bulletin, and this enables links and conversations across subject areas. Those little moments, where a form tutor or a history teacher takes an interest in a student\u2019s science tuition, are a real game changer.\u00a0"

            "text": "To maximise student engagement with the NTP, put as much support in place as possible to remove any barriers. For example, previously we would share lots of information with students' before they started tuition. This often led to them missing vital aspects, not reading it because it was too much or giving up part way through. So, we developed a small, carefully selected \u2018hit\u2019 of information, which has worked better. The barriers might be so simple, you had not thought about it, but for your students it can make all the difference. So, I would suggest that you speak with them and turn their barriers into opportunities to be successful.\u00a0"
