            "text": "Hen Harriers are still exceptionally rare breeding birds in England, and Natural England continues to work alongside partners to support their recovery. One approach is licensing \u2018diversionary feeding\u2019 of nesting Hen Harriers on or near grouse moors. Illegal persecution on land managed for grouse shooting is the main threat to the recovery of Hen Harriers, and is often underpinned by the fact that nesting harriers are known to predate Red Grouse chicks.\u00a0Extensive work carried out under the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project showed that providing substitute food to nesting harriers, such as dead poultry chicks or rats,\u00a0can substantially reduce the number of Red Grouse taken by the parent harriers to feed to their chicks. Licences for diversionary feeding are offered as a legal method of enabling sustainable grouse shooting to co-exist alongside thriving Hen Harrier populations. \u00a0"

            "text": "While the purpose of diversionary feeding is to support the conservation of Hen Harriers, the act of approaching a nest poses a potential risk to birds. As for all birds, too much disturbance risks the parent birds abandoning their nests, leading to the failure of the eggs or death of the chicks. As a general rule, birds are most likely to abandon their nests if disturbed early in the nesting attempt, and least likely to abandon if disturbed later on, after the chicks have hatched. "

            "text": "Hen Harriers are specially protected, such that intentionally disturbing nesting Hen Harriers is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Approaching to within several hundred metres of a Hen Harrier nest has the potential to cause disturbance, therefore a licence from Natural England to provide diversionary food is required in order for this activity to be legal and to ensure risks are minimised.\u00a0Risks to the nest may also arise through the diversionary food attracting other predators or scavengers.\u00a0"

            "text": "A key action under the 2016 Hen Harrier Action Plan is to increase uptake of diversionary feeding as a management technique. The updated Diversionary Feeding Class Licence (CL25) is available to landowners and land managers \u2013 gamekeepers and conservationists alike \u2013 in grouse shooting areas of northern England. The licence allows land managers to establish and maintain feeding stations near to active harrier nests. It is designed to ensure that the potential risks of nest disturbance are minimised, while the benefits \u2013 effectively diverting Hen Harriers from taking Red Grouse \u2013 are maximised. It should be noted that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that diversionary feeding has ever led to any Hen Harriers abandoning their nests. In addition, there is some evidence that diversionary feeding has led to greater Hen Harrier fledging success.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

However, following a number of issues related to diversionary feeding, and further feedback, a broader review was carried out over autumn/winter 2021. To inform this review, we spoke to people who had previously fed Hen Harriers under licence, both in England and in Scotland, Hen Harrier experts, and other key stakeholders. The aim of this review was to learn from all relevant experience, to discuss best practice techniques to reduce risks and maximise benefits, and also to make administrative improvements to registration and reporting. A summary of these changes is shown below:\u00a0"
