He initially presented with focal impaired awareness seizures, although the tests suggested he had generalised seizures with photosensitivity. When Stephen reached adolescence, he started to experience tonic clonic seizures, previously known as a \u2018grand mal\u2019. It\u2019s what most people think of as a typical epileptic fit and usually combines a loss of consciousness with a jerking of limbs and sometimes difficulty breathing. The seizure normally stops after a few minutes, but some last longer.\n\nSettled down"

I hadn\u2019t realised until then that there\u2019s a link between epilepsy and autism, with around 30% of people with autism also having epilepsy and vice versa. Having autism makes Stephen\u2019s epilepsy a bit harder to manage, as he perceives risk differently to most. This continues to present challenges to his neurologist to balance his medication in order to reduce seizure frequency."

He\u2019s a strapping six foot tall man, and if he falls at the start of a tonic clonic seizure, it\u2019s a long way down to the ground, and he has injured himself several times."
