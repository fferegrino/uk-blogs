We\u2019re the pathfinders for our multidisciplinary teams: knowing when to build, when to learn, and when we can only learn by building. This means helping our teams weigh up the value of different problem spaces, understanding the insight we already have, and balancing the risks of the unknowns within different approaches. We keep our teams motivated and on track from sprint to sprint and quarter to quarter, setting out the commitments we want to make.\u00a0\u00a0"

That might be around thinking through a potential solution, or sketching ways to get the data and evidence we need for a key decision.\u00a0"

We now have the space to run more product experiments, building confidence that the services we develop can give the UK a competitive edge, increasing the reach of our exporters, and making sure we\u2019re a destination for overseas businesses wanting to expand.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "We believe successful product development and delivery is all about sizing up the bets you might make. We frame desirable outcomes as product hypotheses that we can quickly prove or disprove. We start small, test ideas quickly, and learn from those tests all to establish whether to invest further in an idea and make a bigger bet. A large part of this process is about partnering with our colleagues across DIT so that we collectively learn about the value of new initiatives. We work with an agile mindset by default, bringing together the latest digital thinking and our insight from the coalface of developing services, then finding ways to meet business objectives through meeting user needs.\u00a0"

This means many of the foundational elements have already been tackled, and we can focus on developing our best ideas, knowing that we\u2019re building in the right way.\u00a0\u00a0"

We continue to invest in our platforms, actively manage our technical debt, and keep our systems secure. Our ambition is to build high-performing, sustainable teams and technology, that are flexible and able to pivot quickly as our environment changes or as we learn more.

Everyone involved learned lots about how to decide on our priorities, and how to compare disparate ideas.\u00a0"

We\u2019re focused on coaching our individual teams around strategic thinking and assessing value of all kinds.\u00a0 By doing this, we can do better and better at sizing up the bets we\u2019re going to make, to discover and solve the problems we think are most valuable. We\u2019re looking to fund teams, not projects, so that we have that flexibility to pivot by bringing new problems into multidisciplinary groups that are already high-performing. We\u2019re also prioritising getting better at sharing what we already know about our users and insight into what\u2019s working, so that teams don\u2019t have to duplicate work.\u00a0"

We can only do this by building great teams, giving them the context and skills they need to create amazing services that deliver business outcomes by delighting our users."
