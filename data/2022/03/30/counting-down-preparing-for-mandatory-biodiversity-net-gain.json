It offers a great introductory resource, whether you\u2019re new to net gain yourself or starting the conversation with others."

            "text": "The brochure introduces the concept of net gain, highlighting the benefits it can deliver for nature, people and the economy. It also draws attention to resources that can be accessed now, with further information, guidance and advice on the approach as it develops."

            "text": "Firstly, read the brochure and the consultation. Both set out information that can help you get ready for the implementation of mandatory BNG. Whilst some of the details of how BNG will work in practice are still unknown, there\u2019s plenty that can be done now to help get ready for when it becomes mandatory in November 2023."

            "text": "The transition period over the next 20 months or so, is an opportunity to get ready for BNG as a requirement on most Town and Country Planning Act developments. The more all of us consider how to implement BNG from our differing perspectives, the better the detailed guidance and outcomes will be.\nEarly consideration of BNG in your plans and projects is just one way in which you can start thinking, but here\u2019s a few other things you can start doing now:"

            "text": "There are also actions that we can all take, for example getting familiar with processes and tools like the Biodiversity Metric - The Biodiversity Metric 3 training for Planners hosted by the Planning Advisory Service is a good place to start."

            "text": "Finally, there are a number of ways to get involved with the work Defra and Natural England are undertaking to feed back and help develop the detail of how BNG will be implemented. For example, Natural England is eager to speak to users and future users, including developers, so that we are able to develop services which meet their BNG needs."
