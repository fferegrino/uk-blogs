Understanding how public perceptions vary over time will help to facilitate responsible data-driven innovation that improves citizens\u2019 lives and drives growth.\u00a0"

            "text": "Public trust is crucial if we are to unlock the benefits associated with the use of data and AI. Without it, organisations lack the confidence needed to invest in data-driven solutions, while citizens are wary of opting-in to data sharing schemes and adopting data-driven technologies. In order to gain public support, data and data-driven technologies must be used in a way that addresses the public's concerns. This is why all of our work at the CDEI is underpinned by public engagement. The survey we\u2019re launching today - which is the first globally to track how attitudes towards data and AI vary over time - provides novel insights about the way the UK public perceive and interact with data and AI. The findings will inform our hands-on work with partners, in the public sector and beyond, to develop data and AI governance mechanisms that support responsible innovation, and incorporate the elements of governance that are most important to building a trustworthy environment.\u00a0"

It was sent digitally to a nationally representative sample of 4,000 individuals, as well as to 200 individuals without access to the internet via telephone. We incorporated advanced analytics, including a conjoint experiment, to understand the factors that influence decisions about data sharing. These insights will inform our ongoing work to support Mission 1 of the National Data Strategy; to unlock the value of data across the economy. Additionally, we conducted an attitudinal segmentation, as well as an analysis of media coverage about the use of data and AI in the 6 months preceding fieldwork."

For example, respondents reported feeling concerned about the safety and security of data; we are currently collaborating with the US on a prize challenge to accelerate the development of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), which can enable sensitive personal or commercial data to be analysed at scale, while protecting privacy and confidentiality. A significant portion of respondents also felt that organisations could be more transparent and accountable when using data and data-driven technologies; we have been working with the Cabinet Office\u2019s Central Digital and Data Office to develop and pilot one of the world's first standards for algorithmic transparency, which will help public sector organisations to be meaningfully transparent about how data-driven tools are being used to support decisions."

They could also prove valuable to those in industry seeking to design data-driven products and services in a way that is trustworthy.\u00a0"
