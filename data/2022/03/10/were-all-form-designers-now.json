This means if we\u2019re serious about improving the justice system we\u2019ve got to get really serious about doing these better.\u201d"

To build this product successfully, we need to understand the broad spectrum of needs and working practices of our digital professionals. Whilst MoJ Forms is no new kid on the block and is currently in Private Beta, the department is in a very different shape to where it was just 18 months ago. We have grown substantially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and have had to adapt to different ways of working. This summer we, therefore decided to step back and run an MoJ D&T-wide survey to learn more about people\u2019s attitudes towards, and experiences of, form design. The findings are illuminating.\u00a0"

            "text": "The 80% of those surveyed told us they have had form design experience at MoJ. Roughly 50% are working on a project with a citizen data submission component to it right now. Levels of experience and familiarity with form design typically reflect an individual\u2019s role and length of time in government, highlighting how common form design is in the public sector. The vast majority of respondents expect to work on a form design project in the future. New joiners with less than 6 months experience were the exception, perhaps indicating that this is an under-appreciated part of government design work."

However, 28% were willing to admit openly to levels of uncertainty and the need for more guidance. Our survey also highlighted that individuals in all professions can have widely different levels of knowledge about the GOV.UK Design System and Service Standard. When asked to rate that knowledge, the average score was 6 and 7 out of 10 respectively but was as low as 1 for new joiners from outside government. This indicates the scale of the adjustment challenge even for very experienced hires and the importance of the induction period.\u00a0"

Whilst complexity is subjective, it is clear that most interaction patterns people are designing for now are advanced. Some of the core features respondents told us they needed to deliver their projects included complex branching, save and return, and integration with other systems. Whilst a multitude of simpler forms do exist out there in the justice system, this is not the type of work we\u2019re taking on in D&T right now.\u00a0"

This means that day-to-day design decisions are often made by those without the official job title. Whilst we are undoubtedly a talented bunch, this finding has highlighted the potential need for MoJ Forms to provide guidance on patterns and sign-post form creation best practices as part of the product experience which we\u2019ll be building into future plans."
