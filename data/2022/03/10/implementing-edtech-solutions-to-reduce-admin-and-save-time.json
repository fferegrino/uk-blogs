It took a member of the administrative team an estimated 45-60 minutes daily to sift through emails and forward the important ones on to relevant staff members. Occasionally important messages were missed."

It included a drop-down menu with a list of categories and when the form was submitted, it would trigger a script that would email the message directly to the relevant member of staff."

This sent an automatic email to the Head of School responsible for that member of staff. They could then view the request and decide to agree/deny it from within a spreadsheet. The staff member would then be emailed automatically with the decision and any comments."
