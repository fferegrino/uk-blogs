            "text": "I applied for this role with no previous experience, but instead with a passion and drive for learning. From my careers research over the years I saw the Civil Service as the place I wanted to be, and I can confidently say that choosing an apprenticeship as an entry route was the reason I\u2019ve been able to realise this ambition."

            "text": "I didn\u2019t finish my A Levels, and was faced with the enormous question: what do I do now? I knew university wasn\u2019t for me, despite the potential outdated stigma and drawbacks surrounding people who haven\u2019t gone to university. I had also always known that I had a dream of working for the Civil Service and an interest in working with data."

            "text": "A couple of years passed, and with fewer hairs on my head and several job rejections later, I was given an interview for a Level 4 Data Analyst apprentice position in the Cabinet office. It came as a shock, but has really turned out to be life changing. As I now know, my fellow apprentices come from all age groups, backgrounds and with different experiences, but with the common quality of wanting to learn and expand their skills and knowledge. The beauty of an apprenticeship is that there isn't a specific \u2018type\u2019 of person you must be, rather it is a route accessible to all, including people like me. It\u2019s a way to gain experience and a qualification, all while earning a salary. It\u2019s win win!"

Ultimately we are all working towards a common goal: achieving the same qualification, but understanding how we apply our learning to our different roles can give insights on how to solve common problems that you might not have thought of.\u00a0"

Here in the Civil Service no day is ever the same, which adds great variety. Working as a data professional means I get to work on a range of projects that support the operating of the Civil Service, which in turn supports the general public to use vital online government services."

It has been a wonderful journey: starting out as a beginner and growing my knowledge, skills and behaviours, some might even say becoming somewhat of a master at it! It\u2019s great to get acknowledgement from your colleagues.\u00a0"

Managing my time is something I never really got to grips with (just ask my mother!) until I started this apprenticeship. Despite the worries I had about whether I could do this, I\u2019ve learnt you are capable of doing extraordinary things when you put your mind to it. I\u2019ve also been surrounded by incredibly supportive colleagues and peers which has been transformative."

I\u2019m sure many of us think of the headaches and potential obstacles when applying for a role, however it is incredibly easy. Apply for a range of roles, not only those you think you are good at, but roles that you are keen to explore or have an interest in. Many skills are transferable, so you won\u2019t ever feel stuck on doing one particular thing. The Civil Service is enormous and the demands of different departments and services are endless!"

            "text": "In my opinion, the Civil Service should continue to modernise and adapt to changing labour markets and workforce needs by continuing to invest heavily in apprenticeships. Apprenticeships give thousands of people opportunities which they may never have had before, and are an effective mechanism for growing talent across all sectors to drive transformation. It\u2019s also a proven way to increase diversity in the workforce and to develop future leaders across the spectrum. What\u2019s not to like?\u00a0"
