Alongside our ITE inspection framework that we published last year, the ECF and NPQ inspection process will provide assurance and insight nationally into the development of high-quality teachers and leaders at all stages of their careers."

Harnessing that motivation, providing opportunities to deepen expertise and keeping teachers excited about teaching are essential to making it an attractive, rewarding career. As we all know, schools are only as good as the teachers who work in them."

            "text": "This must begin with the right foundations. We need to ensure that recently qualified teachers in the critical first years of their career get the right support. The ECF introduces a funded entitlement to a structured 2-year package of professional development for early career teachers (ECTs). This has the potential to transform the early support that teachers receive, bringing it into line with that enjoyed by other top professionals."

The reformed suite of NPQs has 3 courses in specialist areas and 3 leadership courses. It builds on the foundation the ECF provides, with clear career pathways and access to further professional development."
