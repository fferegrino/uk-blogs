Where improvements do not go to plan is when this full spectrum of issues is not sufficiently considered. Too many times I have seen technology being employed as a data improvement solution when the fundamental issue is about organisational responsibilities."

Prior to working at the Geospatial Commission, I worked with the London School of Economics to develop a data value framework for geospatial data to change data improvement from a discrete programme of work to \u2018something we just do\u2019."

Whilst there is an appetite to do more, fundamentally, our Partner Bodies are different organisations with different data and different remits. The result is that FAIR is not delivered in a consistent way across the entire geospatial data system - and that is what matters to users."

This is because the quality of the data itself underpins what is an appropriate FAIR improvement. By quality, we mean the basic \u2018fitness of purpose\u2019. If your data is fundamentally of limited value to users, then investing in FAIR improvements are unlikely to reap rewards.\u00a0"
