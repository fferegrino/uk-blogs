But what if that was paired with a universal basic income that allows the poorest in society to heat their homes in winter, and free bus fares to reduce congestion and lower pollution in our communities. What about building safe bike paths for the commute to work or opening more green areas in our cities to create the physical and mental space we need in our days. And we can go further. Imagine if schools could only feed our children locally grown food, not only improving the community\u2019s economy, but giving our young people a great start in life with nutritious food without the carbon footprint."

It isn\u2019t just about policies either, it\u2019s a spot where people meet for integrated, collaborative work from diverse backgrounds and schools of thought. One of my favourite examples is our National Museum working with local health boards to utilise our rich culture and history in Wales for the well-being of our communities and prevent mental health issues and loneliness."

Each public body listed in the Act, which includes bodies such as local health boards and arts & sports councils, have a legal duty to improve the economic, social, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales.

We also have a new transport strategy focussed on public transport and active travel, putting the car at the bottom of the travel hierarchy, and a new future-focussed curriculum for our children framed around well-being. I am especially looking forward to the Welsh Government\u2019s Universal Basic Income pilot, which if implemented fully, could reduce poverty by 50%. These are all examples that politics can, and should, be done differently. They show that putting health before wealth and planet before profit is possible."

Yet, although we are a small and mighty nation, if we are going to make global change, we need other nations to come on board with our vision and implement well-being frameworks of their own. In 2021, the UN announced its commitment to the Future Generation vision with support for the establishment of a UN Special Envoy for Future Generations, a Futures Summit in 2023 and a UN Declaration for Future Generations. Inspired by the Welsh model, the UN\u2019s futures vision will shape how nations around the world make decisions today for a better tomorrow. Yet, until this becomes a priority for every nation, we will continue to live in a world that allows the poor to get poorer, our planet to get hotter, and our communities to be separated by hate."

There is a global growing interest and care about the limits of our planet and the needs of future generations, and I am calling on countries to establish governance mechanisms for future generations, building on the leadership in Wales and at the UN. Speaking with young people across the globe, they are quite rightly concerned that political leaders and systems are only paying \u2018lip service\u2019 to their interests, only sharing their campaigns for the re-tweets, and passing legislation to appease but barely touch the surface of the issue. We must highlight the importance of placing future generations at the centre of decisions and ensure that they have a voice at the policy level. I have found that the members of my Future Generations Leadership Academy have inspired my work and guided my journey as a commissioner."
