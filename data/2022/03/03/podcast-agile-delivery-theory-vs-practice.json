So now I'm a civil servant. And that was in July. So I've been part of altogether DWP and BPDTS for nearly three years now. Before that, I worked in private sector and information security. And before that, I basically had a long history of working, doing projects, initially kind of working in humanitarian aid, and moved over to IT and tech guess about 10 years ago now."

Being a scrum master myself on the ground, and then going into a space now where I lead multiple teams is a very interesting space. And I've had the joys of having teams and work with other people in different capacities that are either very understanding of how agile is a tool and a framework in which we used to deliver. And also those that are zealots and they they pray to the God of agile. And so it's a very complicated space. And in government, we have all the fun of trying to implement agile in an effective way that's meaningful and honest and effective. But also with constraints that are well outside of our hands at most, that most agile delivery managers are Scrum Masters we never had to deal with."
        },
        {
            "text": "So it's a very complicated space. And I think that difference between theory and practicality, is something that becomes obvious. And I think we're at an interesting space. And I don't know, I can\u2019t remember Barry and Hannah\u2019s background, I think equally, you've got team agile teams, and agile delivery managers that have never done waterfall. They've gone to university, they've studied agile delivery, and they've come out of university, work with us, and they only ever know agile delivery. So you now have the complexity of a waterfall process delivery being completely foreign to them, working in a waterfall and agile delivery space."
        },
        {
            "text": "So that practicality of understanding that all the work that we do whether you are a diehard waterfall fan, or whether you're a diehard for the agile frameworks, the reality is that when you come and work for government and anywhere else to be very honest, there's a practical limitation of that. And we're no different, right?"
        },
        {
            "text": "And so the exciting part is that it's what we talked about earlier being able to develop a culture that is meaningful for us, we we\u2019re able to integrate all those into one where you can take that theory and keep us honest, right? Because some of us have become old heads in that process that have just either been battered down, because we've been sucked to do a certain way to deliver and that\u2019s the best we could do it or not. It allows us to keep honest when we have those purists who understand and keep us honest, as well as mixing that with those that have been here for a while, have worked in different spaces and had that wisdom to help us effectively do it. It's that combination and what we keep talking about, that kind of that place for community, that place for understanding and engagement across a team, that sharing of knowledge, it\u2019s how we do it, right."
        },
        {
            "text": "So when we pull those two together, we do amazing. Bu we are in the state, we have definitely that space, we have that split between the zealots. And we have the those on the far side that have said, \u201cI know what I'm doing, leave me alone to do it\u201d, and those in the middle. So we cover all three camps very well in government. We work them to our success and to our own challenges depending on what's going on."

And I think it's important, but I think in the real world, it doesn't necessarily work out that way. And that's not just true of agile delivery, that could be true of any profession, you know, like you can read things in a medical textbook, but actually performing an operation yourself doesn't necessarily always go by the book. And I don't think it's any different in this space."

And but maybe what we should become more open to doing is sharing the ways in which people are actually implementing it, sharing what has worked, sharing what hasn't, and being very open about the fact of how we do things. And because otherwise, I think maybe new people that join us may think that oh, well, we're all like you say evangelists of the scrum guide. And I don't think that's necessarily true in the trenches, as it were."

It's interesting about those agile evangelists versus pragmatists. And I guess I'm like you, I'm somewhere in the middle. I worry sometimes that when we say, \u201cYou don't have to be exactly an agile zealot, you don't have to follow everything to the letter\u201d, that people aren't using it pragmatically, using most of those really reasoned sensible principles. But they use that as an excuse to not do any of it. And just to do a little bit of superficial window dressing on old fashioned waterfall processes. And I've certainly seen a lot of that over time."

Should I be promoting much more of that pragmatism? Is it my inherent distrust that does that? And should I be a more open person to avoid those people that want to just window dress up superficial agile? We'll need to reflect on that about how things are actually done."

I mean, I don't think we're suggesting that you take the scrum guide and you use it like pick a mix, and you pick and choose which bits you want. I think the pragmatist part of me, sort of sees it as it's window dressing, if you don't, if you don't get it. You have to understand it know how to be pragmatic about it. And I think some of the window dressing sometimes happens where there is a misunderstanding about what people should be doing, and what's right, and you\u2019re window dressing because you're just picking the things that people have mentioned. So maybe you're deciding, \u201cOh, well, I'm going to do ceremonies or I'm just going to do a stand up,\u201d because I've heard that's what we do. Knowing why you're choosing not to do something or why you're choosing to do something I think is where potentially that bit\u2019s missing from that from that setup."

Remember using Shu-Ha-Ri as a model, so you've totally brought me back. But I agree with both you I think there's this kind of, I think we want to be as much of the middle as we can with this. There's no doubt about it."

It's all cool.\u201d You know? Like, that's, that's kind of how I think of how we see it. But I think you have the other side is that danger of like you said, where it's all good theory and you've got the most beautiful, agil- ish team, but they're actually not delivering anything. And that's seen as okay, and I think it's coming to that middle space that we\u2019re all trying to drive towards, that we see agile as a framework and a tool, as you said, Barry, like I said to deliver."

Obviously, as am agile delivery manager we have that inherent space, we want to also be judged that we're also effectively creating a space that's conducive for an agile delivery. So I get that, but I think it's a balance. And it\u2019s exactly like you said, going back to the beauty of the Shu-Ha-Ri, being in that level of maturity in your agile development to know what's right, what's wrong, and what you're comfortable compromising on and what you're not."

Like if you are still in that initial phase, it's not going to happen overnight. It's not a quick fix. And I think sometimes that is a danger as well. You have to get to that point where it's mature. And your understanding is mature that you're able to do that."

            "text": "Really good question. I think one of the common things that we're seeing, I guess, that kind of experience of coming from private sector and coming into government, what we're seeing now is an evolution of agile. So 10, I guess 10-12 years ago, most of us were trying to teach people the basics of what agile was. Now we're at a space where organisations are creating their own culture of what agile delivery is. And we're seeing some really good and horrendous examples of how that's going."

        {
            "text": "Each area and that's the interesting part about agile is that each organisation as its evolving in its kind of agile development, is finding some really interesting things along the way, both in organisational structure, financing, people, morale. So each organisation is handling it quite differently. And I think what we're seeing, both in DWP, from the people that are coming into DWP, as well as trying to keep people captivated in that space, is sometimes that divide between what people see as purists in the agile world. That kind of, you know, \u201cI work in my strap line,\u201d which most people are probably sick of is, you know, \u201cI talked to my delivery manager and remind them you don't work in Google's R&D department for agile delivery.\u201d So there are some basics and some expectations on how it works for each organisation and organisation-specific like DWP have its own constraints that have to be accommodated and understood. But I think what we're seeing across industry, both private and public sector is creating a culture of agile that is meaningful and works for the organisations that are there."

            "text": "I think when you when you look at an organisation as a whole problem, it's when you get sort of like pockets of the organisation that embrace agility. But you can't just have pockets of teams embracing it. So, for example, agility for me, isn't just about a team sprinting, adopting ceremonies, or even just releasing on a regular cadence. And then having leaders sort of claim that their teams are agile, and their companies are agile because of it. I think agile needs to be embraced across the very core of the organisation for it to work."
        },

            "text": "So I think for us, a common problem that I've certainly experienced is where you have delivery teams who are pushing up against sort of very rigid legacy processes. And like the examples of those, are there for very good reason, you know, they're there to protect the citizens such as policies and governance. And but quite often, I do sometimes question if the amount of it is still fit for purpose as it exists now."

            "text": "So in DWP I think some of the most successful projects we've had are where we've been able to have cross functional teams. So we're all used to multidisciplinary teams, where you've got all the different roles in one team, like the engineers and the testers and the designers. But having cross functional teams, where you perhaps got people from policy involved, where you've got your business stakeholders embedded in the team. That is something that worked really well. And those projects tend to work better. Because you're not then building something where you have to go and present it out to some external body and say, \u201cIs this what you wanted? Is it right?\u201d They\u2019re there making decisions with you at the time. We do still have ones where that's harder, because sometimes our stakeholders don't want to do that, they don't understand agile processes, they come from a waterfall business. If they're not working in software delivery, then some of the things they need to coordinate like big operational changes, opening a contact centre, for example, those things have to work on a more fixed deadline. And so they struggle. And really, what we need are people who can push back and educate our stakeholders and build those cross functional teams."

I think, years ago, starting off that kind of process of just teaching it and now seeing evolve, there's been some interesting behaviours that I mentioned, and both of you touched on things that I thought were really whether it was the GDS, you know, tip toe that you put your toe into Hannah. The cross functional teams, I think there's an interesting space and some missing spaces as well, where I don't think we've actually matched up all of our legacy processes and ways which in we deliver projects with the new way of doing it.

And it doesn't answer all, all the all problems, you know, sometimes they don't have the answers, and they have to go back into that into that world. But it's definitely very good for getting very quick feedback. We do it at the moment with operations where we're looking for very, very quick instant feedback on things that we're doing to make sure that we don't get a nasty surprise further down the line, which would essentially be like a big bang to operations, \u201cTada, here's the thing, now it's your problem.\u201d And so having them involved is invaluable to us."

I think some of our teams, the things that they deliver, are best delivered in a waterfall fashion. You know, if you're going to roll out a new PC to 700 jobcentres, that is probably a waterfall task. And it's that maturity to know which methodology\u2019s appropriate way. That's the thing I think we don't always have. So sometimes we're still muddling along with some of those waterfall processes that we've had in place on teams and people don't see they should adapt.

And there there's an inability at the moment, I think, to really separate what's necessary for effective agile delivery from processes that protect us as an organisation and protect the citizen at the end of the day. I think there's still that separation."

I've lived that world, I ran that world. It's not an easy process trying to get that space.

And I think there is definitely something in what you're saying they're like, there's no reason why a team who maybe is working in a more waterfall fashion can't have retros, or we can't have retros with our operational colleagues, because we definitely do that, because there's benefit in having those conversations.

So all the things you can imagine that exist in DWP, and also highly regulated by the government because they\u2019re an insurance company, it's not the same thing. One of the differences I think was there that stood out quite significantly coming into DWP is that the same issues existed. I think what private sector I think does a better job of doing as they also got to the point where enough was enough. And that came really hard and fast. And that was a bit surprising I think for lots of people involved. For instance, they went years back and forth about how to implement agile, they created their own department specifically for agile, to kind of test and try it out to kind of get the culture there. They had all versions of it and then eventually got to a point that said we are a digital organisation, we are going to go this specific direction. If you like it, either like it or lump it, here are options, you will need to apply for your job, you will need to get certified in areas and they took a no holds barred approach to getting it done.

But also they did take a very hard line at points. And it wasn't at all that it was lost in negotiation and complexity politics, with big Ps and little Ps, that they had to work through to get that done. But there did become a point that said our cost value is actually we get more of a benefit of doing X over Y. And I think I saw a lot more of that in private sector of sometimes slowly getting there. But eventually getting there and looking at the actual return on investment to understand what was the ROI for making decision X over Y, and sometimes making very difficult decisions, even in moving the culture quite rapidly towards what needed to go. I think that has a huge impact on the world in which we operate."

That was something I had to get my head around coming into public as GDS doesn't exist as a thing out in private sector. Some organisations are adopting it, some don't.

So whereas in the private sector, there are lots of opportunities to make changes very quickly, and you know, a big process can change and you can implement it within weeks, that just isn't possible on a large scale within DWP. So I think that can sort of be very frustrating and knowing that it can't change overnight. And we have, I would say, much more stricter processes and hierarchy to manage that culture change. So I think like Barry said previously, it's a cultural shift that we're trying to we're trying to do here. So change is a lot slower, but it's worthwhile."

And although that was a big operational hit, in digital it's almost like we didn't blink. \u00a0I'm sure loads of people were scrambling around doing tonnes of work to add on 50% of their customer base over the course of week. But we've designed for that. And I think we've designed for being very flexible. We moved to remote working very easily. We can stand up services. When Ministers get a new idea or you get a change of government or change of minister and they come in with some new ideas, we're really good at standing things up quick.

I think the teams are very good about understanding the landscape in which we operate in, the dangers and pitfalls in being able to effectively deliver and quite complex spaces that we're not in control of. And that ability to be adaptable to those changes, like you said, when you look at those kinds of things that come through, they're not something you necessarily get in private sector.

I think the only consistent thing that there should be is that we're delivering value and we're doing it for a reasonable cost. What we believe in in DWP throughout the many hundreds of teams that we've got working on all sorts of different products and services, is that the teams are empowered to determine their own ways of working, that they're held accountable once they've been empowered for solving a problem. And that that accountability is about delivery of value. And the value is measured by what do our stakeholders want and what do our users want."

And although I think that might sort of be true if you're looking at specific frameworks, there's obviously be standards for those. I think it's different if you just think about agile delivery and our teams. So like, when I speak to my colleagues, you sort of realise that sort every team is unique. And being a delivery manager and DWP is about being able to adapt your approach to get the best out of those individuals and the unique way in which those people work together. And I think if the last two years of being in the Civil Service has taught me anything is that we're nothing without our people and sort of building a strong team that can collaborate effectively and with respect should be the priority for all of us, because I think it builds resilience against most of the things that we come up against when trying to deliver."

I think of my specific role, coordinating multiple teams, having teams and you've got a mixture of agile delivery, whether it be the many frameworks they might be delivering, whether it be waterfall to any of the various agile ones. The complexity of that, plus having empowered teams plus being accountable to government and ministers.

And one of the complexities of most organisations is trying to figure out how do you fund agile teams. We're no different than anybody else, we're exactly in the right evolutionary space. Sure, we'd all like it to be better but it is where the industry is at the moment, and in the IT industry trying to figure out how you balance these teams."

But also there is a need to lay out a bit of a path on how we do that. And that's not through, I think the current governance structures that existed pre agile implementation, it is looking at a new way which we operate. And I think that still deserves its own space to really understand. I think we've got lots of teams that are doing some amazing stuff. And they're using a mixture of all the various skills that we've all known in delivering projects, whether they be your waterfall, agile, new ways of doing agile, evolved agile ways of thinking. And I think it goes with that commitment that we get from a goal standard for me, if we were to use that term, and actually consider that would be that we effectively are able to deliver any product and any service and that's understood and supported from the top down. That our executives down to every member of the team knows and feels confident that they can deliver in a space where they feel safe, where they are productive, where what they're doing is meaningful, and that they're consistently getting stuff out the door.

And that requires a degree of coordination that we haven't really practised before. And it's only in the last two years - ironically, during the pandemic, the hardest time to coordinate - that we've had to really start focusing on that. And it's a skill gap I think that we have. And it\u2019s somewhere that we need people to step up and provide some of those things, scaling frameworks there's lots of them. If anything, there's too much choice. And obviously, some of them we all know, lean to that over dictation of how people work. And so we're still learning as an organisation how do we evolve, we can keep that team autonomy, and yet do the big stuff that requires many teams and some of our teams might have 20 teams working on a single area.

But in the same sense, what I think sometimes we lack if we've got lots of teams who are working on the same thing, is a real solid understanding of the why, as in are we all moving in the same direction? Are we all moving to the same thing? And being super clear about what part each team is playing on that, so you don't start to get a convergence of things. Like you said, Barry, we spend a lot of time in the user research space, which is great. But are we all trying to do the same thing? Are we all looking for the same answers?

I think there is that increased emphasis on leadership. And that we shouldn't be saying how things work. We all bring a role. In a multidisciplinary team, you know, the, you don't tell the tester how they should test, you don't tell the engineer how they should write code. Equally, the delivery manager brings their expertise in ways of working, and we should be prepared to say, \u201cHere's some really good ways of working. Everything we do we do as a team, but you know, I'm advancing my theory.\u201d And I think that translates into the organisation as well. We probably all need to step up a bit more. And when we see that gap, fill the gap. You know, we often say they won't let us do this, they made this rule. And it dawned on me one day that the they that's us. We're the people that make the rules, we all make the rules together. You know, and in delivery in particular, we're often setting rules, aren't we? We're focused on how things work, while the people who are actually doing the work, get on and do it. We're worried about those sorts of things like governance and stuff. We make the rules, so we should be able to step up. And those rules should be faced, based around our beliefs and our ways of working, that we should be empowering teams, but providing that direction, those North Stars."

I think there's also a bit of a creep of people that everybody believes they can do delivery and we don't always get the respect that people understand that delivery itself is the functional skill set. They know our role. They know our titles, but I think people forget that we're not just here to be the people who do the fun, get togethers or these conversations that seem to be quite unique."

We're trying to change learning and development that the practice and the community also own from being just learning to being teaching, as well.

It's inherent in everything we do. And we don't just pay lip service to that. And we prove that we don't just pay lip service to that, by having people who are dedicated to running it, by having time is dedicated to putting into it. And a budget for that stuff as well.

I think there's another element as well, that within a directorate as a lead, I'm also building communities there. Delivery managers, we've got multiple ones that are responsible for delivering. And what I try to do in that same space is to replicate we're also doing the broader group and the space but also get down to some of the nitty gritty things that might be that probably more flexibility in that group, because it's a much more intimate setting of having discussions about what are some of the major concerns, whether kind of at the directorate level or at the team level, to kind of help provide support. So I think there's another element as well that exists within DWP Digital, that it's quite a common space for besides having the large community of practice."

It's a smaller group of people to have that conversation and to share those concerns. And it's almost like a supportive bubble and a wrapper around that delivery community.

And they're all working on similar to you. So they've got similar concerns and they know about that difficult stakeholder that you all have. And they're absolutely fantastic.

What I'd like to see as far as strong, and I guess maybe that goes to the process, is making sure that if we want to see sustainable agile delivery, we have to make sure that we have teams that are able to function as autonomous teams, with the feedback, support mechanisms and guidance needed to effectively deliver.

The team are responsible for their own problems. Delivery is a team sport. And so are you as delivery manager putting in place all those mechanisms that help the team solve their problems, and celebrate the successes as well? So do you have regular retros? Are you introducing them to concepts like team health checks? Are they happy in what they're doing? Have you ensured that they have autonomy? Have you got an environment where they can call out when they don't have that, when they don't feel that they're able to communicate or they're not able to raise issues? Have you ensured that your team is sufficiently diverse, that you're getting all different perspectives to feed into those feedback loops that are going to help your team learn really quickly?

I think sometimes it you end up concentrating more on the delivery than you do on the people. And that's quite a dangerous place to be. And I think when you're building strong, sustainable, agile teams, it's to focus on those people, make sure that communication is happening, make sure that people are comfortable, that it's respectful, and that people are working together in the best way possible that suits them. And that's how we're going to build that resilience going forward."
