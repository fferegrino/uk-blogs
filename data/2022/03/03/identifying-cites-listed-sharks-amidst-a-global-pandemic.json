Before the pandemic, training events and scientific collaboration took place in person, and training of staff managing trade of shark and ray products, such as fins, involved seeing, holding, and feeling the very products that need to be identified. \u00a0For Andhika, who had just landed back in the UK armed with nearly 600 samples to extract DNA from, his entire lab work schedule went up in the air as the university\u2019s laboratory closed."

Instead, he focused his attention on publishing the first chapter of his PhD in which analysed shark and ray trade in and out of Indonesia, mapping the flow of trade and identifying mismatches in declared exports and what other countries report they import. Andhika also grabbed the chance to join his lab colleagues for virtual training sessions on bioinformatics \u2013 the computational science of biological data; then he could analyse the DNA from his shark and ray tissue samples once he was able to get his samples processed. He also produced articles, a poster and footage about his research."

The two-day training event was divided into two parts: classroom training on identification methodology on the first day, and identification practice on the second day. The training was a great success due to the full support from the MMAF Directorate of Conservation, BPSPL Denpasar, and a shark exporting company in Bali who provided facilities and shark and ray specimens for practical identification training."

We also had two trainees from this shark exporting company on board.

Some even received a perfect post-test score! We hope that this training model can be replicated in other parts of Indonesia, although the challenge is to ensure we can provide specimens for training practice. This year we will conduct a third training for stakeholders in Central Java, one of the hotspots of shark and ray fisheries in Indonesia."

The visit will include seminars at Cefas on our fisheries data-collection and stock assessment process, data-limited assessments, shark and ray research, and the\u00a0Fish Health Inspectorate. This will be followed by visits to Border Force\u2019s CITES team based at Heathrow airport to see how they deal with illegal wildlife trade head-on, and Defra, to meet the team supporting this initiative and representing the UK within the CITES community.
