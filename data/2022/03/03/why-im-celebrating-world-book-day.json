            "text": "This year my son Walt wants to dress up as Bilbo Baggins \u2013 is that an improvement on Captain Underpants, or worse? It\u2019s certainly not as easy as Tintin. But if dressing up helps kids get enthusiastic about books and reading, I really don\u2019t mind."

            "text": "Evidence from the OECD in 2002 found that reading for pleasure is more important for children\u2019s educational success than their family circumstances, their parents\u2019 educational background or their socio-economic status. Getting a costume together for World Book Day might be a pain, but if it helps develop a life-long habit of reading for pleasure that improves my child\u2019s life chances, bring it on!"

When he was a toddler, we\u2019d spend a good hour sitting in the book corner of local playgroups reading the same books we had at home.\nNow he can read, the first thing he does on getting home from school is pick up a book. He reads in the car (though he knows it\u2019ll make him sick), in the bath and long into the night. World Book Day for him is preaching to the converted."

The Defra library, like all libraries, has the needs of the customer at its heart, so first and foremost a librarian needs to be a people person. If you\u2019re not, you\u2019re unlikely to enjoy your job or give your users the responsive and reliable service they need."

            "text": "2022 is also the 25th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book being published. It\u2019s amazing to think it\u2019s 25 years since that first book appeared. I cringe when I remember that I wouldn\u2019t read the books when they were published because I was an adult, and they were written for children. In 1997, a teacher friend enthusiastically told me how great the first book was and how much his class of generally unruly and disinterested 11-year-olds loved it, but I still wouldn\u2019t read it."

            "text": "Twenty years later, when I read it to my son and then, eagerly, the rest of the series, I was awed by their creativity and the skill of the writing, I had to admit I\u2019d been wrong to have waited so long. Most school librarians will tell you the key to getting children reading is to find the book that lights the spark. If they live, breathe and sleep football, let them read about it. Not everyone loves fantasy, so let the child choose the book that\u2019s right for them."

Perhaps when we\u2019ve quickly supplied documents that someone was after, or when we\u2019ve helped with a literature search or advised them on copyright issues. Their appreciation matters and when they tell us they\u2019re grateful, it makes us feel good."

After all, to do your job well you need to keep up to date with news and developments in your sector. A colleague told me recently that after a period on temporary promotion they hadn\u2019t applied for the permanent post because it wouldn\u2019t give them enough time to read. A job like that would be right up my son\u2019s street!"
