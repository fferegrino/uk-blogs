Rose is showing a new generation of deaf children just what is achievable. There were endless online platitudes splashed across social media, hailing Rose\u2019s courage and how wonderful she is, letting everyone know they voted for her. However, why has it taken such a long time for societal attitudes to really \u2018see\u2019 these amazing people and great achievements?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

She has significant communication barriers and did it with the help and support of people around her, working together to help break down these barriers. Rose\u2019s dance partner Giovanni recognised that the way she hears music and feels the beat is different, and worked with that to create their routines. The BBC provided BSL interpreters at all times. Cynthia Erivo, a guest judge for musicals week, used BSL to communicate with Rose when giving her feedback."
