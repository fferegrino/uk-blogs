At Outwood, a specialist residential service in West Yorkshire, we support individuals with learning disabilities and autism who rely heavily on familiar routines and structures, which their families and external carer givers are very much a part of."

            "text": "The role of an essential care giver was introduced in the government guidance on visiting in care homes in midst of the pandemic so that residents can have support and companionship from a relative/friend even during periods of lockdown. It refers to individuals who may provide companionship or emotional support and carry out personal care tasks with service users."

            "text": "At the height of the lockdown, Cygnet Health Care gave tablet devices to every service and installed all the necessary virtual communication tools, including Zoom and Skype so that residents could stay in touch with family and friends who might normally have visited in person. Those tools actually enabled some families to be more involved than before, because it meant they could join us at regular meetings which otherwise might have been a struggle in-person."

For us, family and external carers are part of the small community we have at Outwood. In this spirit, we make adjustments to make sure our service users, their families and external carers are all well supported when the unexpected happens, including the ongoing pandemic."
