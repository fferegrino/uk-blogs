We published our 2020-25 strategy 18 months ago which clearly sets out our vision to be the most innovative, open and trusted registry in the world, and we\u2019ve always known that we needed legislative reform to help us to achieve this. One of our 6 strategic goals is to \u2018combat economic crime through active use of analysis and intelligence\u2019 which demonstrates the strategic importance of this work for Companies House."

We\u2019ve been working hard on delivering our transformation programme, making sure we\u2019ll be ready to move quickly once the legislation is introduced. This work has included quickly delivering digital solutions to support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming our systems and services to improve existing customer journeys, and scoping technological solutions for current and future challenges. Thanks to our brilliant people, we\u2019re in a positive position as we approach the next milestone."

However, up until now, we haven\u2019t had the tools to go further and to prevent the misuse of corporate entities. We\u2019ve been very keen to play a greater role and to go that step further, and these large-scale reforms will give us the powers to do that."

The Register of Overseas Entities will apply retrospectively to property bought by overseas owners up to 20 years ago in England and Wales and since December 2014 in Scotland. The new register will be held by Companies House, with support from the UK\u2019s Land Registries."

Entities who do not declare their \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 will face restrictions over selling their property, and those who break the rules could face up to 5 years in prison. The new register will support a new whole-system approach to tackling economic crime and we\u2019re proud to be at the forefront of this landmark change."
