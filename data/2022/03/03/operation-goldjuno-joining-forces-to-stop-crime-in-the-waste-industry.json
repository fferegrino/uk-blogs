But we weren\u2019t stopping there! Our next move was to coordinate a multi-agency operation, code named, Operation Goldjuno, to tackle not just catalytic converter theft, but also the illegal waste sites treating or buying them and to target permitted sites committing offences."
        },
        {
            "text": "While rates of offending have continued to be significantly lower than previous years, Operation Goldjuno seeks to keep offending levels down. The thefts are driven by the increase in the price of metals found within catalytic converters, namely Rhodium and Palladium but these are classed as hazardous waste by the Environment Agency meaning they require careful handling to prevent harm to peoples\u2019 health and our environment. Through raising the profile of catalytic converter crime, infrastructure crime and cash-based money laundering happening within the waste industry, Operation Goldjuno worked to mobilise a proportionate response to assist in intelligence gathering to identify suspected crime."

            "text": "Catalytic converter thefts peaked in March 2021, with 3,245 recorded in the UK that month alone. A surge in the price of precious metals saw theft of catalytic converters become a national issue, and Police across the UK joined forces to combat the trend with the JUWC. Theft of catalytic converters continues to be a priority crime for Police forces across the country with the source sites linked to waste metal sites."
