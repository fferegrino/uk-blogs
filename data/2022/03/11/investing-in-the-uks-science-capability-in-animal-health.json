As I started, the government funding for the transformation of APHA\u2019s Weybridge facility and the construction of a new Science Hub on the site was secured. This started a long-term programme to future-proof the UK\u2019s science capability in animal health (the Science Capability in Animal Health (SCAH) programme)."

            "text": "Substantial investment in the UK\u2019s science capability in animal heath feels particularly timely. The threat from zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans) is growing, as recently recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In fact, COVID-19 made the links between animal and human health clearer to us all. It highlighted the need for modern, future-proofed facilities that can support efforts to continue to strengthen our understanding of these diseases to safeguard both animal and public health and hopefully limit future outbreaks."

APHA\u2019s science is world-renowned, and we collaborate with national and international partners from government, academia and industry on a wide range of scientific projects."

The agency is also a national reference laboratory for 49 animal specialisms. This highlights the breadth and depth of knowledge and expertise of our scientists on a range of One Health disease threats (including new and emerging threats) impacting on animals, plants and the environment."

APHA plays a vital role in the development of surveillance techniques, diagnostics and treatments for diseases such as bovine tuberculosis, rabies and brucella as well as facilitating rapid responses to animal disease outbreaks."

            "text": "APHA and partners can respond effectively because of year-round international and UK surveillance, rapid confirmation of the causes of bird mortality, as well as testing and sequencing of samples to identify the AI strain involved. All of this informs outbreak control measures and, alongside wider testing, allows the poultry industry and others to continue to operate despite the outbreak."

            "text": "Investment in animal health science capability will not only be beneficial for animal and human health but also have positive consequences for the economy. A strong animal health science capability will help to limit costly outbreaks (for example foot and mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis) as well as underpinning the UK\u2019s ability to export \u00a34.2bn of livestock, meat, dairy and animal by-products every year."

            "text": "As we look to the future, to support APHA\u2019s globally important work, we need to attract, train and develop the next generation of UK animal health scientists the SCAH investment at Weybridge supports us to do this by signalling the importance of APHA\u2019s work to current and future generations."
