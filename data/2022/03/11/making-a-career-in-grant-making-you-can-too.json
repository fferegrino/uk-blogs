For many, we are not sure what we want to do and typically change jobs an average of 12 times during our career as we find out what we are good at, what interests us and what helps us pay the bills! A few even make dramatic career changes, proving that you can always change course."

Did you know that the grants spend from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 was almost \u00a3118 billion?\u00a0That\u2019s about 13% of all government spending. Grants is a pacy, innovative and high-profile policy area to work in and make a difference to social and economic wellbeing.\u00a0"

I\u2019m an analyst, tracking how our grants experts are helping departments deliver value for money grant schemes. It\u2019s exciting being able to support government departments working on such important issues to the country. I\u2019ve had a fantastic experience as a new starter to the Civil Service and GGMF. There is a really welcoming culture where everyone is very understanding and helpful to new joiners. I have also found that there is a great sense of community between people in the Civil Service, with great opportunities to connect with people working in other areas and share experiences. My advice to school leavers is be proactive. Graduate job vacancies fill up fast. So don\u2019t wait around for something to come up. Instead, make the effort to go online and start applying for things that interest you early.\u00a0"

I work on the Grants Applicant Programme, designing an online service for applicants to access and apply for government grants all in one place; supporting the Levelling Up agenda, increasing transparency and reducing fraud. This role exemplifies the importance of the Civil Service and the positive improvements it can achieve for the public. Also, I love working amongst the GGMF team as it is full of truly kind, hardworking and welcoming people. My advice to school leavers, or indeed anyone, would be to go with your gut. As cheesy as it sounds - go after opportunities that you find interesting and give things a go. Any experience is good experience. And the Civil Service is such a supportive environment for development and progression with plenty of opportunities for you!"

I\u2019m working on the publication of the official grant spend statistic later this month, holding government to account for how much money is spent on grants and who it\u2019s going to. I love my role working across government, reporting on government objectives to ministers and (for all the nerds out there) I get to solve all sorts of interesting data-related problems. For me, knowing that your work has an impact and helps improve the lives of the public is hugely motivating. I love hearing about the impact of a grant and thinking \u2018we helped with that!\u2019 My advice to school leavers - it may seem that everyone else knows \u2018the secret\u2019 and has it all figured out. But in reality we\u2019re all in the same boat with the same uncertainties so don\u2019t be put off applying for that role or promotion.\u00a0\u00a0"
