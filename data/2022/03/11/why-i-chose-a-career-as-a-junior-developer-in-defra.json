            "text": "Hi, my name is Holly. I joined Defra\u2019s Digital data and technology function in December 2021, but my career in the Civil Service began at the Disclosure and Barring Service in October 2016. I took a role there as a part-time caseworker (at AO grade, the most junior grade), working on the evening shift, to fit around my university studies. The work involved sifting through physical utility bills and official documents to prove someone\u2019s residence."
        },
        {
            "text": "Following my degree, I became a full-time caseworker at EO level, the next grade up, a role I stayed in for a further two years. By the time I left the department, last year, I had moved into a temporary role at HEO level, another grade up again. I was also acting as co-chair and communications lead for the Home Office Gender Equality Network. Busy times!"

            "text": "Starved of variety, I found myself enjoying casual learning, and, without noticing, I arrived at a 365-day streak, primarily focusing on Dutch, even though I only intended to learn French. This led me to find Mimo, essentially Duolingo that teaches coding languages."

            "text": "After a few months on Mimo, I saw an advert on Civil Service Jobs for a junior software developer. According to Gov.uk a junior developer learns on the job by delivering software components. After reading this brief job description, I applied for the position, even though I had never actually written a line of code. I made this clear in my application, which I submitted as a long shot."

Therefore, I\u2019d get the time and resources to learn and grow at my own pace. That was such a powerful message to hear, it gave me reassurance and confidence. That said, never in a million years did I expect to be hired. But I was, and so here I am."

The amount of time that we are afforded to learn and collaborate is so refreshing. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d experienced before taking on this role. I feel blessed to work in such a positive environment, where I am well supported, in addition to providing positive services to the public."
