            "text": "The case study focuses on a project by NHS Digital\u2019s API team, which aimed to \u201cmake integration easier\u201d for developers looking to connect to NHS Digital services. It explores how the team used an API management platform to centralise authorisation, documentation and support. The team also took the opportunity to modernise and improve some of these specific areas as well. For example, they published documentation online for the first time to make it easier to access and manage. Additionally, the team rolled out 24-hour support, since many of the APIs on the platform support critical healthcare services.\u00a0"

            "text": "The case study also outlines the team\u2019s work to redevelop the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) API as an exemplar to showcase the management platform\u2019s capabilities. They built the new PDS API as a RESTful API, and also introduced other modernisations such as serving the API over the open internet and using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for healthcare technology."
