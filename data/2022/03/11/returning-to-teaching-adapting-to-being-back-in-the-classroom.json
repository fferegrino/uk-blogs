I grew up in a poor, working-class family and I believe those teachers changed the course of my life. If I could make a positive impact on just one pupil, as my teachers did for me, I could potentially change the course of their life too. That is the reason I became a teacher."

Working in different schools around the country, I gained experience in both state and independent sectors. I have always been passionate about helping lower-ability pupils, so I also set up intervention groups for \u00a0GCSE pupils studying History."

            "text": "When I heard the government was urging teachers to return to the classroom, I thought about the reasons why I wanted to become a teacher in the first place and knew those reasons remained. Is there a child somewhere that needs support? Would I be the right person to help them at the right time? I still felt like I had something to contribute and that\u2019s why I registered to work on a supply basis."

You get \u2018rusty\u2019, so I wanted to ease myself back in and supply was the best route for this. I secured my first teaching placement and although I hadn\u2019t taught in more than a year, I wasn\u2019t nervous. I didn\u2019t have butterflies in my stomach. I was ready to teach."

As I\u2019ve gotten more familiar with classes, I can be confident they will get back to work afterwards. Returning to teaching has been a learning curve, but one I am relishing."
