This year\u2019s theme is \u2018growth\u2019 and in Defence, we are highlighting the ways in which science and innovation are being harnessed to grow our capabilities while reducing carbon emissions."

Working with our partners Landmarc Support Services and modular construction specialist Reds10, we are delivering the award-winning Net-Zero Carbon Accommodation Programme (NetCAP), which has recently introduced the DTE\u2019s first double-storey carbon negative buildings featuring rainwater harvesting capabilities."

The programme is set to deliver over 70 carbon efficient buildings, which will mean more than 3,900 new bed spaces, across the DTE. The accommodation provides beds, showers and drying rooms all in one modern complex, removing the need for troops to move around different buildings."

            "text": "NetCAP has delivered continuous improvements on the accommodation design, thanks to data from SMART technology and lessons learned being fed directly back into the programme. So far, the programme has delivered the DTE\u2019s first carbon negative accommodation with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of -5, followed by further blocks achieving EPC ratings of -7,-9 and -10. This means the buildings are capable of generating power for the site, reducing electricity costs."

The modular construction process, where large parts of the buildings are assembled off site, has also enabled considerable savings in time spent on manufacture and installation \u2013 from 15 weeks for the programme prototype to less than 13 weeks for subsequent buildings."

            "text": "A key aim of NetCAP has been to boost environmental performance not only in construction, but for the ongoing lifecycle of the buildings. A variety of innovative green approaches have been used to ensure long-term sustainability as well as operational efficiency. These include rooftop solar panels, air source heat pumps and a heat recovery system in the buildings\u2019 showers and drying rooms."

        {
            "text": "The most recent development in this area is the implementation of a rainwater harvesting system, whereby rainwater is captured from the roof using the guttering system, before being filtered and directed into a rainwater harvesting tank that pumps the water back into the building for use. This greatly reduces water consumption within the buildings and uses the wet British weather to our advantage."

The first NetCAP buildings to include this additional feature are at Brunswick Training Camp in Surrey. These buildings, which were completed in February, are both carbon negative and the first double-storey accommodation facilities to be delivered by the programme. The two new facilities provide 104 bed spaces each and join three existing single-storey buildings on site already."

            "text": "The programme is currently set to deliver more of the latest double-storey facilities at several locations. In addition, continuing the trend of innovation and improvement that has been central throughout NetCAP, we are looking forward to installing the DTE\u2019s first carbon negative Combined Joint Operations Centre (CJOC) at Wretham Camp in Suffolk at the end of March."
