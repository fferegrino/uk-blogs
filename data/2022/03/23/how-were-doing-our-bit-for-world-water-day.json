Essentially, this is water that we get out of places like wells and boreholes, as opposed to surface water, which comes from places like rivers and lakes."

            "text": "Water is our most precious of resources. Around a third of England\u2019s public water supply comes from groundwater sources. Some areas, such as Cambridge, derives almost 100% of its public water supply from groundwater."

            "text": "The Water Resources Licensing Service (WRLS) is a service that allows abstraction licence holders to manage their licences online. They can view their licences, delegate access to their account and submit information about how much water they have taken."

            "text": "WRLS is replacing a legacy Environment Agency (EA) system, which is no longer fully supported, to help manage England\u2019s water resources. In June 2021, for the first time, the WRLS was used to bill abstractors, a huge step forward!"

            "text": "The creation of this service for water abstractors has been a collaborative effort between the EA and colleagues from Defra\u2019s Digital Data and Technology function. The teams have been working on it, together, for the last four years."

This is going to enable us to fire off rapid email alerts to licence holders when their respective monitoring station has changed level or flow, helping us improve access to water when it is available and better protect the environment when it is not. We\u2019re just scratching the surface at the moment and will continue to create more and more digital records over the coming months."

The new alerts include more detailed information about the licence condition, and they have been specifically designed and tested to be easy to understand. Our aim is to make it easier for abstractors to comply."

            "text": "In the meantime, there\u2019s still a huge amount of work to be done. Although WRLS came to life in 2018, the service is still growing. The team is passionate about continuing to bring more self-service to water resource licence holders, and about working with the EA on figuring out how we can best manage and protect water through building a better back-office application."
