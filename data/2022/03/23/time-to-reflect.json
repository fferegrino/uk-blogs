It was launched last year on the anniversary of the UK\u2019s first lockdown as a landmark day to remember family, friends, neighbours and colleagues we've lost, and to support people bereaved during the pandemic. Millions took part in a minute\u2019s commemorative silence.\u00a0"

It also allows us,\u00a0 given the passage of time, to take an opportunity to be grateful for our lives shared together. Reflection and remembrance can be a unifying and comforting experience.\u00a0"

That year, Matt and I, along with colleagues at the Competition and Markets Authority, held a Walk to Remember. We wanted to commemorate our loved ones, raise funds for charities tackling the causes of their deaths and share our loss with our wonderful colleagues and friends who supported us through such a difficult period."

I found the walks were a moving and cathartic experience, as they allowed me to take time to remember Eloise, with a tapestry of happy, loving family memories. This helped me with my own grieving process, as well as providing the opportunity to support colleagues through their own experience of loss."
