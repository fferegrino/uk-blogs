But we learned very early on that some communities felt the consequences of COVID-19 harder than others, and although the picture has improved, that\u2019s still as true today as it was two years ago."

The vaccine has been given all over the world and here in England, is estimated to have prevented around 157,300 people requiring hospital treatment. But it offers the best protection to those who have taken it and completed their vaccination course \u2013 first, second, third if required, and booster doses, and not all Londoners have yet done so."

The highest proportion of unvaccinated Londoners were Black Caribbean (43.5%), followed by Black African (32%) and Mixed ethnicity (31.8%) Londoners.
