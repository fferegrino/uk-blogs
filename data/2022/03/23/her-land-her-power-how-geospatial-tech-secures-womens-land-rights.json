And what role can geospatial technology play?"

Women increase their decision-making power, agricultural productivity, income, health and education spending, and investments in climate-resilient land practices. Conversely, land ownership insecurity limits women\u2019s economic and social status and makes them and their families more vulnerable to poverty, eviction, conflict, land grabs, hunger and climate change.\u00a0\u00a0"

For 38 years, she lived in this informal community with no secure title to her home or land. Through a partnership with Tata Trusts and the state\u2019s Jaga Mission, named the \u201cworld\u2019s largest slum land settlement programme\u201dand a winner of UN habitat award, her dream of owning her own place became a reality. \u201cI now have the document that proves that this is my home and my business,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel more secure and am hopeful that this will help my business grow.\u201d"
