To achieve that, multiple organisations, programmes and professions have to come together and collaborate. The work on GOV.UK and its handy step by step navigation for end to end services illustrates that complexity and hides it from the user at the same time. The service of employing someone involves 5 different departments. The activity of starting a business cuts across more than 10 different departments. To bring the different organisations together, you need to understand what\u2019s happening today in a given service area."

The first workshop was used to capture the high-level journey, the second workshop was used to specify the names of transactions and guidance, and the final workshop refined the service landscape map and ordered it in the correct timeline."
