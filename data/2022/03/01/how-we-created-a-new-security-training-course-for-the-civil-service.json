            "text": "The work began two years ago as a project, driven by our team alongside Defra HR learning and development colleagues. The initial scope was to identify improvements to the previous \u2018Responsible for Information (RFI)\u2019 training package, a mandatory piece of learning that everyone in the Civil Service, including contractors and temporary workers, must complete."
        },
        {
            "text": "The favoured solution from very early on was to develop a brand new, bespoke Defra digital training product. However, we also felt that our new product could potentially have wider use across government as it used a behavioural science approach, coupled with more relevant and engaging material."

            "text": "The new training is designed for a generalist audience (relevant to everyone whether they work in an office developing policy, or in the field delivering services), with content that reflects current issues and ways of working.\nThat content has been designed to be reflective of diversity within the Civil Service too. We reached out to several specialist groups across Defra offering them the opportunity to provide feedback or to take part in the testing phases. This engagement enabled us to identify and address potential issues around diversity and inclusion. The new training is also shorter, and it\u2019s more engaging, utilising a variety of technologies and delivery methods."

            "text": "A key benefit of this training is that it reminds us of our responsibilities in the control and handling of information. It\u2019s the only specific security training undertaken by the whole of Defra group on a regular basis. It explains an individual\u2019s responsibilities, what the risks are, what we can do to minimise those, and what we should do if something goes wrong."

This is a Civil Service Learning (CSL) requirement. For those with hearing issues all video and audio components are accompanied by a transcript."

This testing involved not just the project team, but a range of other stakeholders and specialist groups within Defra too. We used the Defra internal comms network to trawl for volunteers. Those volunteers were sifted to ensure they were representative of the diverse Defra workforce."

That strategy, which aligns with the National Cyber Security Strategy, sets out the government\u2019s approach to building a cyber resilient public sector. It will help make core government functions \u2013 from the delivery of essential public services to the operation of our National Security apparatus and critical national infrastructure \u2013 more resilient to cyber-attack."
