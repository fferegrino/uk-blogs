However, field research done by the University of East Anglia and others shows that agricultural products are still finding their way into fresh water, posing health threats for people and wildlife."

            "text": "Nitrogen (N) and Phosphate (P) fertilisers and organic manure are essential to sustain agricultural yields. The timing of the application of fertilisers can help to avoid N and P loss due to rainfall, but inevitably large amounts of agricultural applications can, and still are, leaching into watercourses."

            "text": "In a nutshell, planting a new woodland across slopes or beside a river can help to intercept run-off and greatly reduce pollution from entering nearby waterways. The N and P in overland water flows, and seepage through the soil is slowed, captured and used by trees."

        {
            "text": "Woodland shelterbelts can also act as a physical barrier to spray drift, reducing the amount of pesticide entering watercourses. A shelterbelt is typically located on the upwind edge of a field, although if you want to tackle ammonia pollution from the air, it\u2019s best to plant downwind from a livestock or poultry unit."

            "text": "Strips of woodland along the riverside can also provide an effective buffer zone, by reducing, and in most cases, preventing pollutants from adjacent fields from entering nearby watercourses. You might hear this being referred to as riparian planting and it can help to prevent flooding, by slowing flood flows, reducing sediment and bankside erosion, and increasing underground water storage."
        },
        {
            "text": "Tree roots and the roughness of a woodland floor also hold back soil \u2013 preventing erosion and sedimentation of ditches, which in turn reduces expensive ditch maintenance costs. Ditches are then able to cope with storm events and can alleviate local flooding \u2013 often responsible for ruining crops."

        {
            "text": "A woodland\u2019s soils, leaf litter, and tree roots all improve soil structure and rainfall infiltration \u2013 further contributing to natural flood management. Woodland will act like a sponge by soaking up, storing, and intercepting water, helping to slow storm water in a flood and reducing a river\u2019s peak flow. If created with careful planning, new woodland can help to minimise flood damage in smaller catchments for downstream communities."

            "text": "Planting blocks of trees, known as windbreaks, can also help with drought management \u2013 moisture levels in soil are retained by limiting surface runoff, and the wind shadow will also reduce the amount of water that evaporates."

Woodland creation in the right place can benefit your land, the local community, biodiversity and the wider environment. Planting trees can help manage soil \u2013 keeping more of it in your fields and allowing less of it to get into rivers. This could lead to more sustainable yields, provide shelter for livestock, and create vital wildlife corridors."

Planted at a reasonable scale they can provide you with an income from timber and woodfuel, which can also be achieved through active woodland management in the woods you already have.
