We\u2019ve invested heavily in recruitment processes to improve representation at entry level to our apprenticeship and graduate schemes.

Many come from outside the Civil Service and have had non-security careers previously. Membership is large, but participation is deliberately agile and fluid."

An axe blow to groupthink, it\u2019s intended that security teams can bring work to the Challenge Forum in its early stages, throughout development and beyond, to ensure that the work has considered all aspects of equality, diversity and inclusion, so it meets the needs of all of us across government.\u00a0"

Owners may come away with some tweaks to their proposals, some guided actions on how to better land their proposals with the workforce, or a major rewrite having picked proposals apart with their new knowledge from Challenge Forum members."

They\u2019ve also been consulted on the development of new vetting guidance, bringing their diverse experiences to the table when sharing what needs to be included. This helps ensure the process doesn\u2019t deter those from underrepresented groups from applying for roles in the Civil Service."
