I feel more positive about myself and am enjoying meeting new people and learning new skills I am happy that someone has believed in me and saw that I was a nice person and that I could do the job.\u00a0 Having my own money means that I can pay my own bills and save for holidays and treats like everyone else. We should be given the same right to work as everyone else\u00a0because we are capable and just need the right support and opportunities."

I think that people need to be patient and explain things clearly, as understanding certain things may take some time to pick up. People with Down\u2019s syndrome take longer to learn things in general. I think it\u2019s really good to have been given the opportunity to work in a busy workplace and do the same work as everyone else in my team and to be treated normally!"
