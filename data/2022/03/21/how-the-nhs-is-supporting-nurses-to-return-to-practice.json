My Department has been working with colleagues across the NHS to deliver on this commitment and make sure you are supported by the best and brightest talent. Because it\u2019s only with the right staff in place that we can address the most pressing healthcare challenges that this country faces, including recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling the elective backlog."

Led by Health Education England, this programme provides a route for bringing valuable nursing and midwifery expertise back into the profession. Since its launch in 2014, nearly 8,000 nurses have returned to the NHS and 25 universities across England now offer RTP nursing and midwifery courses."

Others follow the non-employed route which is supported by HEE, with a stipend of \u00a31,000 to the returner to help with costs related to undertaking the course."
