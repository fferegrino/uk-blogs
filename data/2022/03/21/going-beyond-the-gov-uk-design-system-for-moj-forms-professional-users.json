            "text": "The GOV.UK Design System is fantastic. But as most of its components and patterns are made for public-facing services, they focus on simplicity and effectiveness \u2013 so that anyone can use them \u2013 over efficiency \u2013 how fast they are to use.\n\nMoJ Forms target users are different: they are professionals, likely to be more digital savvy and they will use our product more frequently as part of their jobs.\u00a0"

        {

        {
            "text": "MoJ Forms is a web application, not a website. While the underlying technology is the same, the level of interactivity required is not, and the experience needs to be closer to a typical computer application than a series of pages to browse through. So it is no surprise that some of the components we have added are classics of software design: inline editing, contextual menus and modal dialogues."

            "text": "When we decided to modernise our legacy Form Builder application, we realised it followed some of the GOV.UK design principles too strictly. For example, it took \u2018one thing per page\u2019 too literally, and made you navigate to another page (and back) every time you wanted to edit anything in your form. While it was using the simplest of design patterns (a link to a new page), the interaction was slow and disorientating."

            "text": "We\u2019ve used a simple native HTML attribute (\u2018contenteditable\u2019) to allow the copy in each part of the form to be edited, simply by clicking it.\u00a0"

            "text": "These menus allow the user to quickly pick an option in lists and sublists, without needing to reorient themselves. So when adding a new page, it\u2019s easy to click on the \u2018add page\u2019 button and pick \u2018single question page\u2019 in the menu, then \u2018radio buttons\u2019 in the submenu. This is much faster and easier than having to navigate to a full new page to see each level of options."

            "text": "In some cases what we need isn\u2019t just picking an option from a list, but answering one or several questions using a very short form. Modal dialogues allow us to do that quickly. They\u2019re great at capturing a short amount of information without losing your place."

So we added a focus on the first field when you open each page to make this editing capacity visible. Following that update, we haven\u2019t seen any more confusion."

        {
            "text": "For the contextual menu and the modal dialogue, we got the feedback we were hoping for\u2026 which was absolutely none at all. No participant noticed anything unusual, and they used the new parts without a second thought.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "While this could be seen as anticlimactic, that\u2019s the goal of our design: to be usable, and unremarkable. Eventually, our participants had no issues using edit in place, menu and modal dialogues. These patterns have been in place for decades, just not on government sites."

These often involve case management systems and can be anything from managing the transfer of people between prisons to reviewing power of attorney applications. Just like MoJ Forms, these systems need to be used by professionals, repeatedly and for long periods of time, so they also need to go beyond the GOV.UK Design System."
