CP supervisors play a key part in supporting people on probation to do unpaid work to improve local communities and get their lives back on track. It\u2019s varied, meaningful work with job security, a great pension and employee benefits. If you're a people person and looking for a rewarding career, find out more and take a look at our latest vacancies."

I was used to dealing with people from all walks of life \u2013 including some exhibiting difficult behaviours \u2013 so I thought my experiences would give me a bit of a head start.\u201d"

But, at interview, I did ask what was in place to ensure my safety if anything should go wrong. And I was reassured that I\u2019d get a GPS enabled device to call for help if needed.\u201d"

We work with people who\u2019ve committed offences, so know they\u2019ve done bad things. But they\u2019re not necessarily bad people. Many have troubled backgrounds, mental health issues, or struggle to express themselves and get easily frustrated. So, sometimes their conversations can get a bit \u2018heated\u2019. But, as supervisors, we get training to help us deal with a range of challenging behaviours. And 9 times out of 10, you can calm people down simply by taking them to one side and talking to them.\u201d"

Often, people on my groups have never done a particular task or even worked before, and I love to see them learn new skills and grow in confidence. It could be as simple as learning how to use a hedge trimmer or wood working skills. It\u2019s massively rewarding when people tell me how they\u2019ve used what I\u2019ve taught them in their private lives or gone on to find paid work as a result.\u201d"

And I\u2019m passionate about the impact CP can have on people turning their lives around, and the communities we work in.\u201d"
