There was a slight fall in October to December of 2020-21, which reflected the impact of the pandemic on\u00a0 DVSA employees and industry. It is testament both to the dedication of our employees in continuing to do their jobs in difficult circumstances, as well as industry for co-operating with our enforcement checks."
