It hasn't dramatically changed what the team's been doing, though it reassures us that we're building our product in the right way. The live assessment has been a great opportunity to have a panel of experts in their fields, our peers, review our work as it's difficult to see the whole picture when you're working in the thick of it. It also gives us an opportunity to reflect on how we've developed the GOV.UK Design System."

The assessment panel told us we did not meet the criteria in the Service Standard to 'Define what success looks like and publish performance data'. In particular, they identified gaps in how our team measured website usage, used data to complement qualitative research and improved our knowledge of the wider potential market."

We also received helpful recommendations from the panel to make further improvements to the GOV.UK Design System. We're already working on improving some of these issues."

This was exemplified during the start of the pandemic where 52 services were built within weeks, not months, to respond to changing information and policy to help the government provide essential services to citizens. The \"Get coronavirus support as an extremely vulnerable person\" service was built from concept to live service in fewer than 4 days \u2014 it\u2019s estimated this saved the government \u00a310.4m."

In turn, we've also recognised the need to nurture and maintain our community. Last year we hired a community manager specifically to help us do this. We've started hosting co-design workshops with the community to progress some tricky components and patterns that hadn't been contributed yet."
