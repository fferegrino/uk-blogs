            "text": "There were around 60 of us when I started, and we\u2019re aiming for around 100 by April. We\u2019ve had lots of great candidates from both inside and outside government apply for roles, encouraged by our Lead Content Designer Jeni Street in a blogpost last June."

            "text": "The breadth of talent I\u2019ve seen so far at Defra has been amazing. Both in terms of content design skills and experience, but also with things like leadership and how people adapt and develop through content projects and experiences. I feel like I'm involved in something big and important."

I wasn\u2019t used to it, so at times I wasn\u2019t quite sure where I fitted in. This made me think\u00a0hard about my abilities as a content designer and then, more widely, what makes a good content designer?"

We ask questions about who the content is for \u2013 who are the \u2018users\u2019? Why do they need this content? Is it available elsewhere? What\u2019s the best way to deliver it to them? We need answers before we can create successful user journeys."

That might be through observing user research, listening to feedback or hanging out on social media. We are good at listening to the words of our users and designing content that uses their language."

Paul Cannon, a student from Content Design London\u2019s Academy, refers to \u201cContent Design as a form of digital ethnography\u201d. I\u2019m not saying all content designers need a social science degree like me (although, best 3 years of my life, no doubt!). We do need to be able to consider how a person\u2019s interactions online are affected by their lifestyle, beliefs and situations. By understanding users, and the subject matter experts who help us craft our content, we can put the right content in the right place at the right time."

            "text": "Content designers need to be the class nerds. If we don\u2019t know what something means, our users probably don\u2019t either. So we need to be brave and stick up our hands. We ask those, often difficult, questions to make sure we get the content right."

We need to accept feedback from other content designers and user-centred design professionals, stakeholders, our grandmothers (well, maybe not them!) Good content is not created in a vacuum."

I remember being heartbroken in my early career when a stakeholder ignored all my hard work to publish just what they wanted. It\u2019s not an easy job - we need to be able to bounce back and move on."
