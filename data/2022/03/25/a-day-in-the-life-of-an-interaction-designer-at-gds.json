In this blog, you hear from 3 interaction designers, all in different stages of their career as interaction designers."

Reflecting on the difference in confidence from when I first joined and now, it\u2019s clear that I have been able to learn a lot from working closely with other designers. Also, the wider GDS design community provides support and knowledge sharing in the form of design coaches, training courses and talks."

        {
            "text": "Another tool we often use as interaction designers is the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. This is a set of HTML pages and design components that allow people with little knowledge of coding to publish interactive pages to the web. These prototypes are then used to test ideas with users and colleagues."

            "text": "The other side of being an interaction designer is more strategic. It can be hard to nail down the skills required for this area, but I think it\u2019s largely about understanding context: who your designs will be used by and how, as well as what work has already been done in the area."

Remember that it\u2019s fine to ask questions!"
        },
        {
            "text": "One of the best parts of being an interaction designer at GDS is the collaboration with other disciplines. We often pair with content designers, working on the end-to-end journey of a service to help users complete their goal. The user researcher takes these designs and tests them with real users, afterwards the whole team can watch and reflect on which parts were successful and which need to be iterated on. It can be a very satisfying process with lots of opportunities to learn from other disciplines."

This has entailed more of the strategic side of the work; trying to understand what the problems are with the current state, and defining what the future state process could look like."

        {
            "text": "It is worth saying that the work of a senior interaction designer and a service designer are related to each other. The main difference is that an interaction designer is closer to the \u2018making\u2019 side of the design process, so the focus is more on the details of a service."
