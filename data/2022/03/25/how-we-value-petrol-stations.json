FMT is the trade which a reasonably efficient operator would expect to achieve at the site in question, bearing in mind factors like location and local competition. \u00a0"

        {
            "text": "We consider the individual pricing policy of each site, which is up to the operator. They must decide whether to price high but sell a lower volume, or to price low but achieve a higher volume of trade. Those who sell the most fuel in the UK are typically superstore operators, adopting a low price and low margin approach.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Valuation of the forecourt shop is also based on an FMT approach, keeping turnover in mind, and can range significantly from site to site. Recognised brand names will often increase how much customers spend, however these can come with extra costs for the operator, such as franchise fees. Valeting is usually either an automated wash or a jet wash and the same FMT approach applies here.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Once a reasonable FMT has been determined, the valuer will then determine the gross profit, a percentage of which is then taken as rateable value. These percentages are based on the analysis of rents paid by petrol station operators.
