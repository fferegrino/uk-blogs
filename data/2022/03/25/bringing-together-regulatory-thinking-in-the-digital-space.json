            "text": "One of the most profound benefits of the internet has been the democratisation of knowledge. The ability for anyone with a device and internet connectivity to have instant access to the vast array of scientific, technical, or cultural information that exists today has helped individuals find new communities, helped spur entrepreneurship and is helping the effort to solve our largest global challenges, such as climate change."

            "text": "Yet, alongside the advantages generated by the internet, there are of course disadvantages, which range in intent and severity. The original Utopian vision for the internet, as a free-spirited golden era of self-regulation, has receded and been replaced by widespread recognition of the need for digital regulation to ensure that individuals, society, and economies can reap the benefits whilst being protected from harm."

To support consistency between these regimes, the ICO, CMA, and Ofcom \u2013 joined since by the FCA \u2013 came together in July 2020 to create the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF). Having joined as their inaugural Chief Executive in November 2021, I describe the mission of the Forum using 3 C\u2019s:"

But to understand where we can really add value, we need to know what has already been done. We need to be able to spot gaps and see synergies. To do this well means first having full awareness of the knowledge of our own organisations and those we partner with."
