We promote trade internationally, grow UK prosperity and have competitive global advantage through digital, data, user-centered design and technology. In this special edition blog for International Trade Week, we will be focusing on Data Workspace and Investment Atlas on great.gov.uk. We will explore how DDaT\u2019s services and products enable DIT and businesses to promote green trade and investment in the UK and abroad."

These were distributed as PDF documents via email and archived on SharePoint.\u00a0There were almost 100 of these reports, each around 8 pages long. That is almost 1,000 pages of information! In order to search through the reports, each document had to be opened individually and it was difficult for the user to find the information that mattered to them.\u00a0\u00a0This meant the core value of the data was essentially hidden."

Firstly, our data engineers built a pipeline to automatically extract reports from SharePoint into a structured table. This table automatically refreshes every day so that new reports are fed into the table as soon as they are produced. Next, they are handed over to our data analysts who built a dashboard which will allow anyone in the department to search all the information by date or a search term. Finally, our data scientists applied a topic model to the information, which allows users to easily draw out all the data on a particular theme, such as green trade.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
