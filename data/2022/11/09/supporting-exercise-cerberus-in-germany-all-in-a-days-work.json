[MOD Crown Copyright 2022]Exercise Cerberus 22 was the Army\u2019s largest and most ambitious Field Army exercise in Europe for a decade. With 3,500 soldiers and 800 vehicles involved the exercise provided the opportunity to test the five different Brigade Headquarters within the Warfighting Division to validate them and ensure they are ready to play their part in any warfighting operations."

During the preparation phase there was a significant residual Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) risk which we needed to deal with. Working closely with 35 Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal [EOD] and Search unit) personnel \u2013 who deployed their specialists to conduct specific area clearance \u2013 and a civilian EOD contractor we were able to make the area safe for the exercise."

We also conducted regular perimeter patrols to prevent potential incursions by the public which could have potentially disrupted the exercise. We provided logistic and medical advice and guidance throughout too and acted as the liaison with the emergency services in the event of an incident."

[MOD Crown Copyright 2022]During the exercise there were two critical situations which Range Control assisted with. First was the discovery of two WW1 77mm chemical shells! Together with the German Government (who sent their specialist chemical EOD staff to the site to conduct the assessment) we worked to dispose of the shells which thankfully prevented the exercise from being cancelled. The other situation was dealing with a medical emergency that involved coordinating civilian emergency services access onto the area to collect the casualty."
