On a daily basis the staff are building, supporting and maintaining systems and services on a multitude of platforms. We host services in both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, we have core IBM infrastructure in our secure data centres and we also use hosted software from various multinational vendors as a service solution."

            "text": "Opportunities to develop by working in different teams and technical areas are also encouraged. I started off as a network engineer with limited knowledge on IP addresses and subnetting \u2013 I developed into an engineer competent in routing protocols and firewall configurations. But what was great was that I was able to develop relationships with others, learning from those people to become a rounded engineer. Eighteen months ago, an opportunity arose to lead our Azure Platform Team and I saw this as a great time to move across into an exciting new technology. This team was born out of the pandemic but now the organisation has committed to a virtual desktop future, meaning investment in people and technology."

Outside of that we work together to deliver better services to our customers whether internal or external \u2013 they all matter."
