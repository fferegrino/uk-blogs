Led by Thalia Baldwin and David Henderson, the UK delegation included representation from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Ordnance Survey, Office of National Statistics, British Geological Survey, UK Hydrographic Office and the Geospatial Commission. The UK\u2019s representation was further supported by a range of private sector colleagues from across the geospatial ecosystem."

There was significant international interest in the role of the Geospatial Commission itself and how we set direction through the UK\u2019s Geospatial Strategy, uniting various aspects of the UK ecosystem together. We presented our work on the policy aims of the Q-FAIR (quality, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) framework, the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR), location data ethics and measuring the value of location data."

This index ranks the countries based on Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (IGIF) adoption, foundation data, partnerships and collaboration, industry leadership, application and user adoption of data, and finally data access, capability building and digital readiness. The index places the UK as number two in the world, behind the USA."

As a result, others are looking to the UK for leadership and guidance as they build and develop their own geospatial capabilities."

I would therefore like to propose that once you get to the end of this blog you make a cup of tea (other beverages are available) and take a moment to just reflect with a degree of pride on the current state of the UK ecosystem and your contribution to the UK\u2019s geospatial capability and global standing. Thank you!"

            "text": "However, time waits for no one, and like a good cup of tea if you do not pay attention before you know it has gone cold and ceases to be appealing any longer. This leads me onto my second take away and that is we cannot be complacent. From the range of talks and exhibitions at UNWGIC, it is clear how rapidly other countries are developing their capabilities aided by new technologies and uninhibited by legacy systems. This means they are able to make huge jumps in terms of the data and insights that they are able to realise, which is in turn having a profound impact on their decision-making and their abilities to leverage their respective global competitive advantage."
