Our users provide a range of services, from passport applications to children\u2019s services, fishing licences to business continuity. To help us do this, we changed the way we run our annual user satisfaction survey."

            "text": "When we designed the survey in 2020, we would only send one per team, to the person who first set up the service. While this approach has benefits and made sense at the time, it also meant we weren\u2019t always getting the full picture."

        {
            "text": "We know that people who set up a service on Notify are more likely to be decision-makers. They may not be the people who use Notify on a day-to-day basis. It therefore feels risky for us to assume that these individuals can tell us about the experiences and needs of their whole team."

            "text": "So in 2022, the third year of the satisfaction survey, we changed our methodology. We sent the survey to everyone who has signed in to Notify at least once in the past year, even if this meant collecting more than one response per service."

            "text": "It also means we had enough responses to be able to break the results down by categories such as type of organisation, job role and access needs. This makes it possible for us to identify whose needs we could be doing a better job of meeting."

It\u2019s possible this reduction is down to the change in our methodology. If we get a lower score with a larger (and more diverse) group of users, it shows that we\u2019re not meeting everyone\u2019s needs."

Others said that Notify\u2019s model of creating reusable templates rather than one-off messages does not fit their use case. We also identified a need for more data and better reporting once messages have been sent."
