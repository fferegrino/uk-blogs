Some are complex, requiring the installation of additional software, or the hiding of malicious code masquerading as a something legitimate, like an aptly named Trojan Horse. Others can be the product of a supply chain breach and the delivery of hostile modified hardware. And some simply rely on the goodwill of its victim, like social engineering techniques requiring just the click of a button for all havoc to break loose on one\u2019s device. The latest \u2018Cyber Insider\u2019 article will focus on the idea of \u2018one click\u2019 threats by discussing what they are, how they work and how we can best protect ourselves from the dangers they present."

Who hasn\u2019t asked a friend, family member or colleague for help in times of need? However, in the world of cyber, this predictability leaves us vulnerable to threats, in particular, social engineering."

            "text": "Social engineering is a manipulation technique that banks on these most common of human characteristics. It is the backbone for a number of the cyber threats we regularly face including phishing, social networking, and telephone scams. And whether it be an email, text or tweet, this technique often prompts the user to carry out a specific action, such as the click of a link or the downloading of an attachment, unleashing malicious software in the process. You can learn more by watching the recently released Cyber Confident Social Engineering video."

Time is precious, and in the fast-moving world of Defence, where emails come and go in regular fashion, we\u2019re spending less time checking and more time doing. As a result, we\u2019re becoming increasingly vulnerable to the threat of phishing."

            "text": "Much like the name suggests, phishing involves hunting. Unlike the popular past time however, this type of hunting relies less on fish and more on the collection of our personal data and information. Most common in the form of emails, social engineers will construct carefully worded correspondence masquerading as trustworthy sources, luring us into clicking a URL link, PDF file or a similar attachment. And as the title of this article suggests, one click is all it takes. Once clicked, these expertly designed traps are able to free malicious malware onto our devices."

The obvious answer here would be not to click on questionable links, download unrecognized attachments, or respond to strange messages. However, these social engineering techniques are designed to be convincing, and manipulative, and their creators are banking on your inquisition and goodwill to lure you into a \u2018one click\u2019 cyber trap.
