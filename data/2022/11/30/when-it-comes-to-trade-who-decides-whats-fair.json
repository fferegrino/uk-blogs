In recent years environmental concerns over land use in the production of biodiesel have made it less attractive as a solution to many countries\u2019 energy woes."

            "text": "Argentina is among the world\u2019s largest producers of biodiesel, and due to changing market conditions, found itself with an over-supply of the fuel. Low-priced exports of biodiesel from Argentina triggered anti-dumping allegations from the EU and the US, resulting in import tariffs which drove Argentinian producers away."

            "text": "While Argentina managed to successfully challenge some of the anti-dumping duties levied against it through the World Trade Organization (WTO), other complaints have since materialized regarding Argentina\u2019s biodiesel exports, most recently from Peru, which has also accused Argentina of subsidizing their biodiesel industry, enabling their producers to undercut global prices."

        {
            "text": "Earlier this month Argentina initiated a request for consultations with Peru through the WTO, objecting to Peru\u2019s anti-dumping tariffs on their biodiesel exports. The complaint focuses on the calculations Peru undertook to set their anti-dumping duties which Argentina says were either lacking in information or inaccurate. Argentina also asserts that Peru failed to establish causation between the low-priced biodiesel and ensuing injuries to the Peruvian biodiesel market."

        {
            "text": "Since Peru failed to conduct an objective, informed examination, Argentina claims that Peru\u2019s anti-dumping tariffs and countervailing (anti-subsidy) duties were illegal. Should the consultations fail, Argentina will likely instigate a full complaint through the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, requesting the establishment of a panel."

This is a highly technical, complex and time-consuming process which requires careful assessment of all available data, much of which will be drawn from foreign countries."
