The presence of Ranunculus is usually a benefit, rarely a nuisance. But the history of river management has not been kind to water crowfoot, to use Ranunculus\u2019 common name."

            "text": "Found in gin-clear chalk streams, Ranunculus springs from a sturdy root network that clings to the gravel on the riverbed. Long, narrow, tassel-like segments that grow underwater become vast raft-like structures that flow gracefully with the current."

In June, the long, slender stems carry white flowers that are held above the water level, that are around 2\u20133 cm across."

If one bank is owned, then riparian ownership is usually up to the centre line of the watercourse.
