From the beginning of my time at Companies House, I\u2019ve felt it\u2019s a place that works hard to build an inclusive and welcoming culture. The diversity and inclusion priorities and agenda are not just for show \u2013 they\u2019re part of daily working life."

My body couldn\u2019t fight it off and instead went into a sort of shutdown state, leaving me battling chronic pain and fatigue. After being unable to work for several months, I was ready to take tentative steps back into the workplace. The challenge was finding an employer who would understand my situation and be flexible to the adjustments I needed."

            "text": "The people-led networks have been particularly helpful to me. They\u2019re created by colleagues to support each other and raise awareness of the issues that matter to them. Our networks include the mental health network, the ability network and the carers network, among others. They organise training sessions, awareness sessions and colleague catch-ups so that members feel included and heard. For example, the mental health network provides mental health advocates and first aiders for anyone who needs support in the workplace. The networks also hold events across the organisation, which highlights just how much Companies House cares about wellbeing and inclusion."

It has become synonymous with the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD), held annually on 3 December. #PurpleLightUp calls on people to drive social change within their organisations, help develop workplace policies for disabled employees, and spark conversations about disability inclusion worldwide."

Last year we invited our CEO Louise Smyth to join us in a podcast to discuss the importance of celebrating the economic contribution of employees with disabilities and why disability networks are such a powerful vehicle for cultural change."

We highlight the potential barriers that people with disabilities might face, both as an employee or as a Companies House customer. We improve guidance around how to answer questions on health conditions and disabilities, and encourage senior leaders and colleagues to think differently about disability and take action where needed."
