Dynamic Dunescape is an ambitious conservation project aiming to restore 7,000 hectares of sand dunes in England and Wales."

In a previously damaged area that is now suffering from lower plant biodiversity than the surrounding dunes, diggers were used to strip away the top layer of turf to expose patches of bare sand. This will create better conditions for sand dune wildlife."

The clearance work successfully reduced the cover of thick blackthorn scrub and Great mullein has been one of the first plants to colonise the area adding a splash of bright yellow to the area. The site has also seen Common restharrow appearing. Exmoor ponies have enjoyed rolling in the bare sand patches too, and both the ponies and cattle have been grazing the regrowth in the area helping to keep the area open and prevent scrub regrowing. I hope our work this year reaps the same success next year."

It\u2019s been fantastic to do something unique and linked to the environment in Cornwall and a great way to finish my Reserve Service. I would really encourage others to volunteer for and support exercises like this."
