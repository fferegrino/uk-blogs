We are part of the export growth mission in the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team at the Department for International Trade (DIT). Research shows that many UK businesses need guidance to export their products and services. DDaT have collaborated across DIT, and across government, to develop a range of services and products to help exporters along their export journey. In this special edition blog for International Trade Week, we\u2019ll be showcasing how DDaT enable DIT and businesses to trade through our external and internal-facing services and products. Focusing on Learn to Export, great.gov.uk, Check How to Export Goods (CHEG) and Data Hub, this blog will cover how UK businesses are able to find their markets through our specialist technical support.\u00a0"

This was not just in areas such as renewable energy, but also from banking to retail to the automotive sectors. By tracking the proportion of wins that are green in Data Hub, we can understand which sectors are contributing most to green wins. Where there is growth potential we can use this to calibrate our business plans and strategies.\u00a0\u00a0"

For example, encouraging colleagues to \u2018tag\u2019 wins requires behavioural change and an explanation of the value of data to better shape our plans for the future. There is still a lot of work to do, but as teams' priorities are increasingly turning green, the UK is in a strong position with compelling offer for China, and Chinese companies have a recognised Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for green trade. Data Hub is a great way to both track our work and showcase the range and value add of our work to the UK\u2019s green trade and investment priorities.\u00a0"
