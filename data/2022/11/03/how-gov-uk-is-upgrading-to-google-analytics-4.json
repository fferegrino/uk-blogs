Google intends to replace the current version of GA (Universal Analytics or UA) with a new version in the near future. This means we need to upgrade to the new version or we\u2019ll lose a valuable way of understanding GOV.UK users."

            "text": "We wanted to implement GA4 using Google Tag Manager (GTM). Whilst we did consider alternatives, GTM came out as our best option. It allows for easier sharing of data collection methodologies, provides a preview and testing mode, and is already widely used across government."

We want to test everything is working, compare the data and understand any discrepancies, and to give users and departments time to migrate. If we just flipped from UA to GA4 we'd run the real risk of not discovering any issues until it was too late."

Disabling enhanced measurement - a feature we\u2019re not using - slightly decreased the size. By contrast, we were able to increase the size significantly by adding custom HTML tags. This was achieved by adding deliberately bloated code that would never be added in reality, but suggests what could happen over time without care."

        {
            "text": "The best size that we could achieve was around 99 KB, which was nearly 5 times the size of the JavaScript needed for UA. This was concerning, but didn\u2019t provide information about the real impact for users, since JavaScript can be loaded separately while the rest of the page is loading."

            "text": "We discussed the potential performance impact of dual-running with a range of people across GOV.UK, including developers, analysts and senior management. We had to communicate clearly what this meant, and have plans in place if the performance wasn\u2019t acceptable."

We would measure the performance of the site but be ready to go with an alternative to GTM if it wasn\u2019t acceptable. Our alternative was the Google tag, which has a slightly smaller JavaScript size and works in a similar way to GTM, but lacks many of its features."

            "text": "Some metrics increased as expected, such as the overall JavaScript size and the total time for the page to load. The good news was that, although these metrics increased, it had little to no impact on how fast the pages appeared to load (perceived performance) for users or how soon they were able to interact with them."
        },

            "text": "Interaction time and perceived performance are important as they let the user know that the page is now in a usable state. Even a 50 millisecond difference in the performance of a page can make a page feel slow to a user, especially on low specification devices, which will likely feel the impact a lot more than faster devices."

The blocklist only stops these things from executing - they are still downloaded as part of the GTM JavaScript. This means the size could still get out of hand if not monitored properly."
