            "text": "We often fail to test the things we\u2019re uncertain about and instead spend a disproportionate amount of time on the things that are givens. This leads to long explorations, without conclusive evidence to make good, timely investments. We can avoid this by prioritising our assumptions by their risk, then testing them. If you are working in a big problem space, doing this will focus your service team on learning the things with the most value."

We\u2019re left in perpetual exploration, like me digging for records in a shop basement, but less fun. This can happen when we mistakenly spend all of our time according to what is most valuable for the user. Value for users is incredibly important, but there\u2019s a nuance to it."

This will help form a good backlog for a discovery or alpha. This method can also help in other situations when you're working in big problem spaces with lots of uncertainty, and don\u2019t know where to start."
