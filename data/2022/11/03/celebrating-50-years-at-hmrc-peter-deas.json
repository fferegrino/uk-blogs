I\u2019ve spent time working in the Estates team in London, which looked after a set of buildings and estates in north London, and I really enjoyed my role because every day was different."

            "text": "I now work in Nottingham, because a relocation package was offered in the early 1990s, and when I first moved here, I worked on pension schemes for about 4 years. I moved back to HR in 2001 and I\u2019ve worked in HR ever since because I really enjoy it. I have moved around roles in that time ranging from general HR recruitment to HR talent. Another job I really enjoyed was on the Ascend programme. It's a talent development programme for Grade 6 and 7s, and I made so many friends across the organisation and we\u2019re still in contact even now. There are so many faces across HMRC, and I know lots of people who will always come up to me to say \u2018hi\u2019. I worked on Ascend for about 5-6 years and now I\u2019m leading on the Movement to Work programme."

There was a marquee at my house and everyone from work came. I was amazed it was kept a secret and everyone came to it, including my colleagues from London. My family from London also came up, so that was a career highlight because it was directly due to me having been at HMRC for 40 years. I have fond memories of the celebrations."

My parents had a big influence on this because I actually applied for three jobs all in central London. The first was the London Fire Brigade, which I got accepted for. The second was the Metropolitan Police, which I got accepted for. The third was HMRC. I was very close to accepting the Fire Brigade because that's something I always wanted to do, but my parents stepped in and said both of those careers are very dangerous, and they encouraged me to work at HMRC because it was office based."

In my career development conversations, they've always helped me along and helped me to go into jobs where I want to be. I\u2019ve found the Movement to Work role to be different to anything I\u2019ve done before but it was a positive step and I\u2019m grateful that all my managers have helped me in my career."
