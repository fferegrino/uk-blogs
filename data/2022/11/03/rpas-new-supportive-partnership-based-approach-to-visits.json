        },
        {
            "text": "To reflect this change, inspections are now referred to as visits, a broad term covering inspection, monitoring and environmental outcome visits. Inspectors are now referred to as Field Officers and the Inspectorate is known as the Regulatory and Advice Service."

            "text": "We will continue to carry out visits for control purposes because we\u2019re giving out public funds, but with the aim of supporting farmers by offering greater levels of advice, guidance and signposting to help improve compliance with standards and scheme requirements, and achieve better outcomes."

            "text": "The RPA Field Officer\u2019s role is to visit farm premises to ensure farmers and claimants are complying with UK and legacy EU legislation, scheme rules, and agreement options.\u00a0 We undertake more than 6,500 visits each year, supporting the farming, food production and food trader sectors across England. Our Field Officers are a source of advice and guidance on holdings as well as remotely, supporting farmers, livestock and landowners with their applications and compliance. Going forwards, our advice and guidance activity will increase as we work with farmers and land managers to help them secure the outcomes of their agreements, prior to checking compliance with scheme controls."
        },
        {
            "text": "As part of this supportive approach, we have introduced a new visit record checklist. This will help inform farmers of their responsibilities, and you can also expect a summary of the visit on Cross Compliance and CS Domestic visits, including any advice and guidance given, as well as what is going well in the agreement. \u00a0We want to use this insight, in combination with other data sources, to help all our scheme participants meet their obligations."

Our aim is to improve your experience further through:"

We\u2019ll continue to support farmers and land managers through the agricultural transition, seeking to place profitable and sustainable farming and food production at the forefront of environmental good practice. \u00a0We share your passion for high quality food production and a flourishing environment and will continue to seek ways to help you meet scheme obligations in a way that reflects your commitment and our duties in managing public funds."
