With the government's target to reach net zero emissions by 2050, building greener, more sustainable infrastructure will be a fundamental way in which we achieve this ambition and deliver a cleaner future for the UK. To meet this goal we are investing in carbon friendly solutions, factoring biodiversity into infrastructure build and increasing carbon removal to protect against the impacts of climate change."

Announced in 2020, the programme is committed to rebuilding or refurbishing 500 schools over the next decade. All of those built under the programme are designed to be net zero carbon in operation and have low energy use. Both sites we visited have living roofs (roofs that are partially or completely covered with plants and vegetation) and enough photovoltaic panels (panels that are installed for the conversion of thermal energy into electricity) to power the schools. This is one of a number of projects that are implementing greener methods to help create the future we want to see."

Crossrail used BIM during project management, construction and design to save time and money. This includes the pioneering build of a \u2018digital twin\u2019 - a realistic digital version of the physical railway line, providing more accuracy over how it is designed and constructed.\u00a0"

This includes subsequent rail projects such as HS2, which also used a \u2018digital twin\u2019. The representation will be created and managed using digital engineering tools, providing capability to review and assure the railway as it is designed and constructed."

They demonstrated Advanced Work Packaging in action and how every aspect of the project is now using a common data platform from engineering design and quality assurance/quality control, through to construction and commissioning."

Of course, we can\u2019t do this without a mutual vision between government, industry, academia and others. We need to get to a place where all of us can better challenge people and projects to adopt the TIP, by sharing best practice, spotting and managing risks from the start and monitoring metrics more closely.\u00a0"
