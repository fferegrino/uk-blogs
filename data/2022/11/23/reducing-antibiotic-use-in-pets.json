Numerous studies have shown that bacteria, including antimicrobial resistant bacteria, can spread between pets and their owners. Despite this, until recently there has been limited focus on the use of antibiotics in companion animals, compared to the significant amount of work conducted to reduce use in humans and livestock."

Also part of VetTeamAMR is the existing RCVS Knowledge Farm Vet Champions project. This provides farm vets with free CPD on AMS as well as access to a SMART goals tool, to help them improve their antimicrobial use."
