Ten young birds have recently been transported to England from France to found the breeding programme."

Despite recolonising naturally from the northern isles, they have remained rare due to ongoing illegal persecution and have failed to recolonise the lowland habitats that were used before their original decline."

The reintroduction is being led by Natural England and, if successful, will support wider efforts to restore the hen harrier\u2019s historic breeding range in England."

We plan to source birds for release through captive breeding of rescued and orphaned individuals, the progeny of which will be released into the wild. The first ten birds that will found the conservation breeding programme have recently arrived in the UK from France and have completed 30 days in statutory quarantine. Veterinary checks have confirmed that they are free of disease and their health is being regularly monitored as they settle into their new home. They are not suitable for release back to the wild, but we hope they will be capable of leading long and healthy lives in captivity, and of breeding successfully to produce young birds for release."

The conservation breeding programme is being hosted by the ICBP, world renowned experts in breeding birds of prey in captivity, and we are also working with rescue centres in continental Europe, with support from staff involved in other successful reintroductions."

            "text": "While hen harriers breeding elsewhere in Britain favour upland moorland, those in continental Europe show a strong preference for breeding in lowland arable crops. Establishing a lowland population of hen harriers in the UK would help to support a stable, self-sufficient population with the potential to expand in range. A detailed feasibility study by the University of Exeter confirmed the suitability of mixed farmland in southern England for a possible reintroduction. The Salisbury Plain and West Wiltshire Downs were identified as a prime location for releasing hen harriers, as this area contains a large expanse of high quality semi-natural grassland amongst arable habitats, a landscape that provides the birds with suitable roosting sites and an abundance of prey. It also has consistently good numbers of wintering hen harriers, which could be important for future genetics and behavioural interactions with released birds."

If this phase is successful, we hope to move on to releasing captive-bred birds over a number of years, perhaps even as soon as 2023. Over the course of the project, we aim to release around 100 birds, a number that would have a good chance of achieving a sustainable breeding population, according to the feasibility study and research into population viability."

            "text": "As with all reintroduction projects, we have considered the risks faced by birds once they are released into the wild, and we have carefully planned the release site and future work in order to mitigate and manage these risks. All released birds will be fitted with satellite tags so we can monitor their progress and survival, locate the nest sites of any that breed, and attempt to identify the causes of any deaths. Persecution remains a concern, but we are prepared for this, and will follow up any disappearances of tagged birds as assiduously as we do under our northern hen harrier tracking programme."

We plan to share more details and updates as we move into this new captive breeding phase, including more on the project background and aims, and insights into the progress of the conservation breeding and the fascinating lives of the released birds."
