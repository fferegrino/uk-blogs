            "text": "Seaweed wash ups are more likely to happen, and be more visible, when the plant is large after a long growing season and starts to break down. This means they tend to be seen more in the autumn and winter months."

            "text": "Marine life such as whole invertebrates (like starfish), crabs and other crustaceans can be vulnerable to wash ups as they tend to live in or migrate to shallow water, which means they are more likely to be swept on to beaches. This could happen all year round but is more common in the autumn and winter months."

We will also work with other organisations such as the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) or the relevant Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authority so they can investigate if we don\u2019t believe pollution is the cause."
