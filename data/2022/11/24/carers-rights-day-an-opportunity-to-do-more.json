It\u2019s prompting a rethink of the way we identify carers because of the vast numbers of people assuming this role every day. Although an average of 4 million cease caring every year, many people find themselves becoming carers or returning to caring responsibilities, sometimes at short notice."

Whilst the number of unpaid carers in the workplace is around one in seven, this ratio is far higher in the NHS at one in three staff and there are suggestions this could be similar in social care."
