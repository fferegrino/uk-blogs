Cefas, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) jointly hold the UK Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Reference Centre, which exemplifies how the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) science agencies work collectively to tackle this major challenge using a true One Health approach."
