            "text": "It\u2019s been around 18 months since the Department for Transport (DfT) published its review of heavy vehicle testing in Great Britain. And, since then we\u2019ve been making progress towards implementing the review\u2019s findings."
        },
        {
            "text": "You\u2019ll remember that the review concluded the current model of testing is fit for purpose, but that vehicle operators and Authorised Testing Facilities (ATFs) needed more flexibility with test bookings. We agreed to implement the review\u2019s findings and have been steadily working towards delivering these since last year."
        },
        {
            "text": "Improving what we do is important to us. We want customers to receive the best possible service from DVSA. We have already allowed more ATFs to open and ran some focus groups with ATFs and vehicle operators to look at how we can bring some of the review\u2019s other recommended actions forward. I\u2019d like to talk to you about these in more detail."

            "text": "I mentioned some of the focus groups we held in my last blog post, but I thought it would be useful to share the thinking we\u2019ve been doing as a result of the feedback from industry. For me, they were key to understanding how people use our services and what they need from them."
        },
        {
            "text": "You might remember that we heard two clear messages from customers \u2013 they want certainty and flexibility. The current process of booking testing capacity and booking tests can be stressful and bureaucratic. I believe there\u2019s a lot we can do to move away from what currently feels like a bartering process for testing capacity."
        },
        {
            "text": "This has helped us understand that to provide the service vehicle users need, a move away from the current quarterly scheduling process with ATFs would be helpful."

        {
            "text": "Our current thinking is to move to a model where we agree normal levels of testing hours/days with an ATF \u2013 and then they stay that way until changed, rather than \u201cbidding\u201d every quarter."
        },
        {
            "text": "An ATF would be able to request changes to that profile \u2013 for example, if they are growing their business \u2013 and we could agree to a permanent change to that level. Or an ATF could request temporary changes \u2013 for example, if there is a peak in local demand. ATFs would still be able to cancel days if they are not required, with charges applying if this is done at short notice."

            "text": "By taking this approach, we hope to give certainty of what is available (so operators can book ahead with ATFs) but also ensure there is short term flexibility too."
        },
        {
            "text": "To implement these changes we would also need update the technology we use for ATFs to be able to manage this, and for us to schedule testing time, as well as review the contracts we have with ATFs."
        },
        {
            "text": "The good news is that we\u2019ll be able to build on the work we\u2019re doing to introduce the Manage Your Vehicle Testing (MYVT) service for ATFs \u2013 which some sites are already piloting for us."
        },
        {
            "text": "Because of the way this is being designed, we\u2019ll be able to extend it in the future from providing account information, to enabling ATFs to request when they want testing time/days and change what they have scheduled."
        },
        {
            "text": "Making that whole approach more efficient should make it easier for ATFs to deliver the service that vehicle operators and other users need."

            "text": "This will not happen overnight \u2013 but rest assured that we want to reform the booking process next year and implement changes needed to get there."
