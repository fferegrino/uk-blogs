I\u2019m a business analyst. I work on an award-winning project. I can represent my employers and showcase what great business analysts the department has\u2026 can\u2019t I?\u00a0 With gusto, I submitted my application, detailing how I would bring the learning I\u2019d gained from the conference to my peers. Imagine my surprise when I was selected to go!"

Prior to the conference, we all met with each other to look at the agenda and decide what sessions we\u2019d like to attend. There was so much on offer and the agenda was jam-packed. The morning of the conference I had a few nerves: would I know what everyone was talking about? Could I hold my own in a business-related conversation?"

As the day progressed, I began to realise a few things: I was actually enjoying myself! I had valid contributions to make. DWP Digital is a great place to work."

We have a strong community of practice who strive for excellence within the organisation."

I\u2019m a big advocate of bringing people on a journey with me when I\u2019m trying to influence, and the session gave some excellent, practical tips on how to do that. I even went on to watch some TED talks on the subject."

It helped me realise that I love being a business analyst and I value the work that I do in helping our most vulnerable citizens, and I value the organisation I work in. DWP Digital has invested in me, and it has helped me to invest in me - and I\u2019m proud of that."
