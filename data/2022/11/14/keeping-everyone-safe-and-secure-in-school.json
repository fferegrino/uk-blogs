We identify where investments in mitigation measures could be made to reduce the potential impact of losses where the highest risks exist. Over time, investing in resilience will effectively reduce the risk profile of the RPA and therefore losses to schools who are members."

That could be something as simple as some repairs to a playground to fitting security windows or new fire doors."

        {
            "text": "The second approach involves looking at RPA member schools across England with a particularly high-risk profile, be that based of their geographical location or type of school. For example, schools that are in areas where crime rates are high or schools which offer residential accommodation, which have a different risk profile to non-residential schools as they have people on the premises 24/7."

We will then make recommendations and aim to secure funding for that school from the RPA. Each case is judged on its merits, including the overall benefit to the school and the long-term return on investment."
