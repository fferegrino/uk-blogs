This results in a situation where a company needs to be authorised by both MHRA and the Home Office. This leads to a conundrum because:"

You need to comply with Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) which is an unlicensed activity. If you are performing any further processing steps (including drying and trimming) we need to know what is happening where. This also includes steps AFTER you have sold your product, because the subsequent activities carried out can change what type of licence you need."

The point at which a material becomes an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or a medicine can differ depending upon what further processing steps there are. For example, cannabis flower/flos/bud could be a starting material, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or a finished product (i.e. a medicine) so your position in the manufacturing process is dependent on what happens next and not just what you do. This is because the regulatory framework sits around the product, not the process - so it is important that you understand where you, your activities, and your product fit relative to the finished medicine that the patient will receive."
