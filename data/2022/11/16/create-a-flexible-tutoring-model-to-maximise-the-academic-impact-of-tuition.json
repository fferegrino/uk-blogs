This has allowed us to reach a greater number of pupils and to match the right tutors with pupils, responding to their specific needs. Having a high level of flexibility and choice allows us to maximise the academic impact of tutoring and fully utilise available funding.\u00a0\u00a0"

We\u2019re able to use our academic mentor or external tutors to run sessions outside of formal school hours, at times that are more suitable to pupils and their families. We also take the learning preferences of our pupils into account. Some children prefer learning on a Saturday morning, rather than after school. We cater for this through a Saturday school. This maximises pupil engagement during the tutoring sessions. It also benefits those pupils who only have online access at the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Matching pupils with the right tutors maximises the positive impact of tutoring on attainment. Some pupils prefer working with a new member of staff, such as an academic mentor or an external tutor. This gives them the opportunity to start afresh, if they have felt stagnated for a long period of time. Whereas pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) may prefer working with a tutor who is someone they already know and trust. So having the option of using current staff who they already have an existing relationship with, through the school-led tutoring route, is hugely beneficial for these pupils.\u00a0"

Whilst our focus is on core subjects such as English and Maths, we don\u2019t want to neglect those pupils who need support in other subjects, such as humanities. At secondary level, tutoring is delivered in a range of GCSE subjects. We\u2019re able to access a pool of tutors with specialist knowledge through our tuition partners. The organisations we work with are based locally, so they know the community and understand the challenges we face. Another real benefit of working with tuition partners, is that they create a plan to respond to the specific needs of your school.\u00a0"

We\u2019ve had an overwhelmingly positive experience and are recruiting more academic mentors, to reach more pupils. They can hit the ground running and need very little support, so quickly become part of school life. We have the flexibility and choice to direct them into different spaces, including in the classroom, working alongside teachers, without taking children out of their classes and out of their routine. They can also work outside of formal school hours, including during holiday periods. For example, if an academic mentor works on a Saturday morning, they can have the Monday morning off in lieu.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

I would encourage schools to make the most of funding whilst it\u2019s available and to think outside the box. You have the flexibility to make the NTP work for you. Be creative and think beyond the guidance, this will make it work for your institution.\u00a0"
