Normally, detections of bird flu decrease during the spring and summer months, however, \u00a0the epidemic has continued, particularly in ducks, geese or other large swimming birds and sea birds. As we head into winter 2022-3, there have been further increases in detections recently, both in wild and captive bird flocks, leading the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u00a0(DEFRA) \u00a0to put in place an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone in the UK."

            "text": "The winter migration of wild birds is likely to further increase transmission of bird flu as infected wild swimming birds can infect local and \u00a0wild bird species who do not migrate, poultry or other captive birds resulting in local transmission either directly between birds or indirectly by birds encountering environmental contamination, including faeces and feathers from infected birds."

Currently, in Great Britain, the public are encouraged to report findings of a single dead bird of prey (including owls), three or more dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or gulls, or five or more dead birds of any species."

If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds, you must report it immediately by calling in England the DEFRA Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local\u00a0Field Services Office."

Your symptoms can be checked over the phone. It is also important to report any recent international travel, as bird flu is a disease that occurs globally, and some countries present an increased risk."

Currently the influenza A subtypes that infect people are H1N1 (which is related to the pandemic of 2009) and H3N2. Bird flu virus infections which cause disease in humans are very rare, but unfortunately when they do, they can cause serious disease and deaths. Bird flu infections in \u00a0people from birds usually requires very close contact with an infected bird so the risk to humans is currently considered very low."

Although none of these strains easily infect people and they aren't usually spread from person to person, small numbers of people have been infected around the world, leading to a small number of deaths."

This \u2018Eurasian\u2019 H5N1 strain of bird flu causes high levels of disease in poultry and other birds, but the risk to human health from it is considered very low. This strain can be clearly distinguished from the previous \u2018Asian\u2019 H5N1 strains because it belongs to a different subgroup (clade)."

While previous cases were confirmed as the H7 strain, January 2022 was the first time H5 had been detected in a human in the UK when a single asymptomatic H5N1 infection was identified. This person who acquired the infection in the UK had very close, regular contact with many infected birds over a prolonged period. Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person."

Consequently, as part of the response to avian influenza incidents, the UKHSA has put measures in place to monitor individuals who have had concerning exposures to confirmed and suspected cases of avian influenza in birds to monitor their health and give preventative antiviral drugs to reduce the chances of them becoming unwell."

Exposed people may also be offered anti-viral treatment after recent exposure to the virus."
