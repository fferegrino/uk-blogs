This movement may be via natural pathways such as through watercourses, wildlife migration, or wind dispersal, but more frequently it is a result of human activity. It is not always possible to see tree pests and diseases and they spread easily in soil or organic material carried on footwear, clothing, and bike tyres. Some tree diseases need water to disperse, so the risk of these being spread increases when conditions are wet."

At this time of year, as autumn turns to winter, there is more mud and leaf litter on the ground that can collect on your boots and tyres. By taking some very simple routine actions you can help keep trees healthy."

Explain to others what you are doing and why. My friends and family are all aware of why I\u2019m cleaning my boots and kit at the end of a walk in the woods, and I\u2019m happy to let any curious people in the car park know what I\u2019m up to too. It\u2019s all part of encouraging the cultural and behavioural change we need to help save our trees from damaging pests and disease so future generations can enjoy them. We want biosecurity to become the norm in the UK the way it has in countries like Australia or New Zealand."
