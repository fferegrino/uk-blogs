They are now being made in two instalments each year for the remainder of the agricultural transition period to help farmers with their cashflow. Around 50% of the overall payment, amounting to over \u00a3679m was issued in the summer, with the remaining balance to be paid from December 2022."

These are open to farmers who claim BPS only, or those who claim BPS but have land in Countryside Stewardship or Environmental Stewardship. BPS farmers with common land should contact the RPA who will help with their application. The SFI is easy to apply for online, and gives farmers an ongoing payment that will reward sustainable practices which support food production and benefit the environment. Further one-off grants are also available, including the Farming Investment Fund, Farming Innovation Programme and the Future Farming Resilience Fund."
