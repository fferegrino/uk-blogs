We are excited to be able to share a powerful story from the perspective of one of our colleagues, Fatema, who has worked in HMRC for over 30 years. She takes us on a journey of self-discovery, faith and HMRC's positive response to diversity."

Colleagues were not always aware of Islamic beliefs, traditions and were naturally curious. There were no prayer rooms, and little was known of what my needs were. Those colleagues who knew me in my younger days will recall I didn't wear a hijab."

            "text": "This all changed in 2003 when I went to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage. Muslim women wear headscarves as a symbol of their faith and commitment to the Almighty. As part of the dress code, I\u2019m expected to cover up and despite the stifling heat, I found it relatively easy to do. My faith and conviction increased during those blessed days so did my attachment to the headscarf."

            "text": "Not only did it cover bad hair days, (that is a blessing seen as the locks are no longer what they once were!) but my whole attitude to my faith changed. For the first time ever, I felt proud to be who I was and amongst the throng of women - I found my real self as a Muslim woman."

I noticed that there were no mirrors and several ladies had commented about this lack of provision. Anyone who wears a headscarf will testify, its near impossible to arrange the intricate folds without looking in a mirror. The solution was simple, I contacted the Estates teams in Leeds and requested a mirror, coat hooks and hand dryer to be added to the facilities."
