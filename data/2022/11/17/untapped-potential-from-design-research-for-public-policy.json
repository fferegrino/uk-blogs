This was the premiss of a lively meeting held on 3rd October and attended in a hybrid format by around 60 participants from all across the UK and beyond (including from Finland, Luxembourg, Sweden and Switzerland)."

This meeting followed a successful inaugural meeting in June. The aim of the network is to gather civil servants, policymakers and public servants together with designers and design scholars across multiple relevant contexts. Structured around three provocations, this session included three speakers spanning design, policymaking and political science, which then opened-up through multiple discussions in small groups and a culminating plenary discussion."

            "text": "Dr Carl DiSalvo (Georgia Institute of Technology, US) started the session by drawing our attention to some important distinctions between the work of designers and policymakers. He argued that design can do things that policy cannot, and that this can benefit policymaking. Specifically, he proposed a role for design in keeping democracy \u201cvibrant\u201d through its capacity to act within particular places and with people that may be beyond the direct reach or scope of policymaking."

            "text": "A case in point is the design work that Carl has been doing with colleagues for 15 years in Atlanta (see DiSalvo, Design as Democratic Inquiry, MIT Press, 2022). That work is community and place-based. In his words, \u201con-the-ground, in-the-streets\u201d, in which participatory design and data-driven methods are means through which stakeholders gather and articulate their particular issues of concern. Issues relevant for example to housing policy may include community residents\u2019 experience of inequitable provision, property mismanagement and code violations. In addition to a capacity to act within such particular places, Carl argued for the capacity of design to make \u2013 for example, maps, data collections and visualisations. Thus, design can not only \u2018witness\u2019 but make concrete, enduring evidence of citizen experiences in ways that are directly relevant to policy. For stakeholders, the materiality of design can empower them within agonistic and advocacy processes, thus contributing to democratic policymaking."

He spoke from his extensive experience as a public servant and from the UK Policy Design Community, a community of practitioners across about 60 local and central administrations across the UK. He started by pointing out a common but outdated view of policymaking: a slow, linear and top-down process in which a decision-maker has a brilliant idea, which is then handed over to policymakers, then to others to implement, and finally to an evaluator. In contrast to this, he proposed five improvements within contemporary policy design."

            "text": "Andrew pointed, firstly, to a design-led approach premised on experiments. As a means for gathering evidence and testing policies early on, experiments can reduce risks and assessing \u201cpublic value\u201d before full roll-out. Secondly, he articulated a particular design capability that is holistic and systematic, a \u201cwhole systems\u201d approach that can support those in government to navigate the complexity of increasingly complex challenges such as the pandemic and climate change. Next, he argued that design can provide governments with a \u201cmultidisciplinary nervous system,\u201d ways of working that are collaborative and constructive across silos and professions. Fourthly, by pointing to design in industry, he explained that design for or in government can improve productivity. Lastly, he concluded that design contributes to building \u201cpublic trust\u201d in government through approaches that are responsive to communities and citizens."

Provocatively, she pointed out that the turn to design may reveal some limits of policy \u2013 for example, limits to policymaking that is primarily technocratic and dominated by party politics. Our contemporary context is characterised by, in her words, \u201cradical uncertainty,\u201d in which there are high stakes and an urgency to act in relation to issues such as the pandemic and climate change. In this context, it\u2019s difficult to anticipate events, to predict how they will unfold, and to handle the plurality of legitimate views on how to proceed. The turn to design can be a way to bring \u201cthe political\u201d to policymaking, to disrupt some of the ontological assumptions and entrenched practices that limit policy today."

            "text": "Catherine continued by outlining three different potentials of design for policy in terms of \u201cthe political.\u201d Firstly, by visualising and materialising issues that are complex, ambiguous and contested. Catherine argued that design can identify opportunities and enable \u201canticipation\u201d of future policies. Secondly, design methods can open policy practices to different forms of expertise and to citizen\u2019s experiences. This more instrumental potential may, on one hand, simply add to the set of tools available to policymakers or, on the other, catalyse systemic transformation. Lastly, she articulated a \u201cpragmatic\u201d use of design, in which experiments and innovations are means to learn incrementally in ways that are more quick, cheap and collaborative within inherently messy policy processes."

Places (and power) inside and outside of the \u201cmachine room\u201d of government were discussed. Resonating with both Andrew and Catherine\u2019s contributions, some explored the issue of continuity versus change in current policymaking practices, and implications in terms of failure, risk, legitimacy and democracy. Resonant in one participant\u2019s phrase: \u201cthe speed of trust,\u201d there was a concern for learning and reflection in policymaking."
