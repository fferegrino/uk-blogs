The information from the Hive Count is vital for planning and preparation for outbreaks of disease and exotic pest incursions. The survey runs until 31 December 2022."

This work is central to the role of the NBU under the Healthy Bees Plan 2030, which aims to keep honeybee pests, diseases and other hazards to the lowest achievable levels and enhance effective biosecurity."

The locations of apiaries local to confirmed sightings of Asian hornets - as identified on \u00a0 - continue to inform the placement of traps and the deployment of Bee Inspectors to facilitate the swift location of hornet nests and their destruction, which is carried out by the National Wildlife Managements Centre team."

            "text": "Finally, the National Hive Count offers a useful indication of changes in UK honeybee colony populations, which gives us the opportunity to identify trends in terms of the popularity and prosperity of beekeeping in the UK. For instance, there were 191,000 colonies counted in 1986, which decreased dramatically to just under 80,000 colonies by 2008. Colony numbers recovered to 126,000 colonies in 2013 and this further increased to 272,631 in 2021. (Several assumptions form part of the calculations used to get these numbers, so it\u2019s classed as an \u2018experimental statistic\u2019.)"

            "text": "As registration of honeybee colonies and apiaries is not mandatory in the UK it is essential that the NBU takes every opportunity to encourage beekeepers to keep their records up-to-date and clearly explain the benefits of registration."
