Working in social care gives me the opportunity to do something different every day and build relationships with incredible people, from colleagues to residents and their families. I\u2019d like to share with you my experience of working in social care and why I believe it can be an aspirational career for many people."

Since moving to Vida Healthcare, I work closely with the nurses and house managers who form a key part of Vida\u2019s 500-strong team. I\u2019m heavily involved in making sure effective care is provided for each resident through a range of initiatives and interventions. Our ultimate goal is to transform the care available to people living with dementia and provide the best possible care for our residents."

I think for people who don\u2019t work with vulnerable people it can be easy to think that Covid-19 has disappeared, but this is not the case."

We are actively promoting the vaccine rollout with our staff, and working hand in hand with our pharmacy supplier to deliver bespoke clinics to enable our staff to access the vaccines."

I provide support for staff where requested, for example taking bloods from residents where required, or caring for wounds. I also attend regular meetings with our clinical lead to prioritise training, care and equipment and take part in GP rounds."

            "text": "It\u2019s not just about resident care, however. Educating our staff to become dementia ambassadors and provide the right care for residents is crucial. From phlebotomy (the taking of bloods), to catheterisation and the simulation of real life scenarios, this prepares our staff for any situation which might arise."

            "text": "There are, of course, numerous challenges I experience on a daily basis, but end of life care can be a particularly difficult time for everyone involved. As a resident approaches this point, difficult decisions have to be made. This is of course extremely hard for family members and friends, but can also be upsetting for staff who\u2019ve formed particularly close bonds with individuals. I play a crucial role in working closely with key people to talk about what\u2019s happening and why these decisions must be made, and make sure residents receive the best possible care until the very end."
