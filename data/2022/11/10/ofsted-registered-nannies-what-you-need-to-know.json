This is because parents need to use a registered service in order to claim support towards the cost of childcare. If you\u2019re a parent reading this and you are thinking of employing a nanny, the Childcare Choices website\u00a0explains everything you need to know about how to save money on childcare."

            "text": "Our guidance is aimed at nannies. It must be the nanny themselves who registers with us, not the parents. This means that, because of data protection and privacy laws, we cannot discuss a nanny\u2019s application with parents or other individuals. Understandably, this can be frustrating but please bear with us as we try to process the applications as quickly as possible. Currently, this takes an average of 10 weeks."

All you need to do is contact us to let us know you want to start providing this type of care and we will send you an updated certificate. You can email us from the email address we have on record. As of June 2022, 2,360 registered childminders had already done this!"
