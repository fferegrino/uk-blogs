            "text": "We know how good we are, the value we add and the lives we transform, but to hear it from our peers and those beyond the walls of care homes, clinics and community centres means so much. It means we\u2019re making a positive impact \u2013 and getting noticed."

            "text": "Whether or not you feel such recognition is long overdue, I believe the shared adversity of the pandemic \u2013 and the closer cooperation and support it encouraged between care and clinical services \u2013 made it inevitable social care nursing would take its place alongside the many other highly prized nursing categories."

            "text": "Initiatives like these, born in a period of restricted movement for staff, residents and visitors, have proven to be as timely as they were innovative. It was even more impressive to know this programme was created to solve an issue Oakleaf colleagues identified themselves. Critically, it was person-centred, takes participants on a journey of self-improvement, and can be easily replicated across different services and settings, which is brilliant."
