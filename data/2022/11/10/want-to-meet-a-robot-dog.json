Somebody asked if we should be building new prisons in 2018 or instead thinking about different, innovative, digital solutions."

            "text": "I went into panic mode. I was the only digital person in the room and knew nothing about prisons and certainly didn\u2019t have a clever alternative solution! Between thinking \u201cplease don\u2019t ask me\u201d, my mind went to something I\u2019d recently seen on TV where armed robot guard dogs had basically taken over the world. Once this was in my mind, there wasn\u2019t space for anything sensible."

        {
            "text": "Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t asked for my views, and obviously I don\u2019t really think armed robots are an alternative to prisons. But I do think that as an organisation we collectively need to be thinking outside the box about different approaches and solutions to some of the very real and complex problems that we must contend with."

            "text": "We live in a world in which rapidly evolving technology provides us with many opportunities and has fundamentally changed the way in which we consume services. We stream TV rather than watching channels through an aerial, we have an app to order taxis or food, we bank online rather than going into a branch, we even get most of our junk mail via our email rather than the post-box."

            "text": "And then we come into our place of work and we check those expectations of the way that we operate in the outside world at the door. We work with scanning machines that are bigger than cars, we cart paper from one place to another, and we input information from one system into another. All of which means we are less efficient than we could be. And we have less time to do the things that really matter and will make a difference to users of our services, whether they be applying for legal aid, guardianship or compensation, or someone who wants to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society."

            "text": "I hope you\u2019d agree that we can do better. I believe that changing the way we work, whether it involves technology or not, needs to be a collaborative effort. And so, I\u2019m delighted to launch our first Digital Innovation month ."
