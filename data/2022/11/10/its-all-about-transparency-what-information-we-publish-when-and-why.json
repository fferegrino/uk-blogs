Whenever we ask parties for information, we seek a non-confidential version of the evidence and publish it as soon as we can to the public file. This is important because everyone can then see the evidence on which we base our decisions. Both natural justice and WTO rules require that.\u00a0\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Transparency also means that other parties to any case can comment on the evidence, including telling us if they think it is wrong, incomplete or misleading. When companies send us detailed evidence \u2013 transaction-level sales data and detailed breakdowns of production costs \u2013 we have to verify that we can rely on it for the purpose of our calculations. When we have verified data, we share a draft of our verification report with the company whose data we have verified before publishing it to the public file. This ensures they can correct any misapprehensions we may have formed, and that no confidential material is accidentally published. Additionally, they are forewarned of what we are going to say publicly about their data. Transparency makes for both fairness and effectiveness.\u00a0"

As the WTO treaties and our law require, we publish a Statement of Essential Facts describing the evidence we have used in reaching our judgements, and our provisional conclusions. By publishing our evidence and our provisional conclusions, we again ensure that anyone can provide additional evidence that may not have been considered before we finalise our thinking.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "People also take the opportunity to tell us that they agree or disagree with our provisional conclusion, and why. It is important for people to have the opportunity to say their piece and to know that their view has been heard even when they do not get the outcome they seek; that provides some reassurance that a fair process was followed, which can reinforce faith in decision making. At the same time as sharing our provisional conclusions, where we have done detailed calculations to assess a specific dumping margin for a particular exporter, we will have shared those calculations with that exporter. There\u2019s no risk of compromising confidentiality because all the data is theirs. The exporter has the opportunity to check that we have both interpreted their data and done our calculations correctly. Often they are better placed than we are to spot any misunderstanding of the data they have provided. For example, as a result of our sharing of calculations in the aluminium extrusions case recently, we revised some of our dumping margin conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
