This runs during a three-month period between December and February each year, so updates are published after the outstanding Basic Payments Scheme payments have been processed, and before pre-population of claim forms for the following scheme year."

These include aerial photography, satellite imagery and Ordnance Survey MasterMap updates. We only use evidence that is less than three years old to carry out mapping updates. We decide if a digital land parcel needs to be updated based on the latest evidence we hold."
