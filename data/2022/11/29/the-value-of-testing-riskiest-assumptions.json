It also comes from limited trust between people, slow feedback loops, or slow delivery; to mention a few causes. None of these featured in our prioritisation methods. We weren\u2019t focusing enough on the things that were most likely to cause us to fail. When this happens, explorations lose focus on value. They drag on and become failed investments."

In an uncertain problem space, riskiest assumptions are most likely to lose us our bets. When we spend more time testing our riskiest assumptions, we reduce uncertainty. We also reduce the cost of failure, as we learn the big things that don\u2019t work early on. That's much better than finding out later in development, or after launch."

The team should already have a common understanding of the problems and opportunities. Other prioritisation methods are more useful here, and less time-consuming."

But potential solutions often have assumptions, which the riskiest assumptions approach can draw out."

Going forwards, we were all referring to the same knowledge."
