Now that we\u2019ve moved to living with COVID, we need to review our reporting of COVID-19 statistics to ensure that we\u2019re looking at the right metrics for our lives today. This has meant making changes to how we present data in the COVID-19 dashboard and COVID-19 surveillance statistics, and these changes are summarised below.\u00a0\u00a0"

It can also be calculated for all four nations of the United Kingdom and so enables some comparisons.

This metric reports the number of people who have been vaccinated as a proportion of the total current registered population. Crucially, for coverage, both the number vaccinated and the size of the population eligible for vaccination come from NIMS (National Immunisation Management System), a live system that includes everyone registered with the NHS."
