            "text": "In the UK, it is often thought that woodlands should be left alone. However, much of our woodland ecology relies on disturbance to refresh natural life cycles. Before humans colonised, animals such as beavers and bison, as well as wind, fire, disease and flooding, would bring light to the forest floor, allowing seeds to germinate and the regeneration of flora and fauna. As these animals became extinct, their activity was replaced by that of humans."

            "text": "Our ancestors harvested timber to provide fuel and shelter and cleared woodland to free up land for agriculture. Over time, woodland ecosystems have adapted in response to these disturbances and many of our native species now depend upon them. In contrast, unmanaged woodland sees biodiversity begin to decline."

            "text": "Woodland management doesn't only benefit nature. Harvested timber is a valuable resource that can provide a sustainable source of income and jobs in rural areas and, if put into long-term use, acts as a carbon store."

            "text": "Climate change is an existential threat to woods and forests, and we need to give them the best chance to keep pace. This may be by introducing diversity, including species that will cope better with changing conditions. There are other threats too, our woodlands have to withstand browsing deer, bark stripping by grey squirrels, competition from invasive species (e.g. rhododendron), disease pressures (e.g. ash dieback), and a greater risk of drought. Sustainable management makes woodland more resilient to these pressures, ensuring that their benefits to both humans and wildlife can be reaped long into the future."

This landscape scale project will be taking a joined up and collaborative approach, bringing together landowners, academics, and trained volunteers. Continued management of the grey squirrel population will enable the woodland to regenerate and recover, creating a better-connected habitat and improving biodiversity, ultimately leading to reintroductions of Red Squirrels."
