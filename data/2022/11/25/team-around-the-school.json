In April 2021 we shared a blog from Sheffield City Council on their Building Successful Families (BSF) model which included a significant team around the school element."

To gain further insight the national team spoke to Bury Council, Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council to understand how their TAS model was developed, and the benefits achieved through this model."

Each model has been carefully thought through to ensure it is beneficial to the children, their families and the core team. Depending on each area, the core team can include Schools, Early Help Coordinators, Social Workers, School Nurse/ Health Representatives, Neighbourhood Coordinators and many other multi-agency partners, for example Police, probation and mental health services to provide whole family working and achieve positive outcomes."

            "text": "To identify the children and families to support, LAs utilised a mixture of data sources and matched these across families to develop a RAG (Red-Amber-Green) rating system of children in the school. The data streams included children on free school meals, Children in Need (CIN), Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) as well as others. Using data in this way enabled a more \u2018scientific\u2019 method of determining vulnerability with an evidence base. One of the LAs interviewed said their list was \u2018scarily\u2019 similar to the list the school had, but it was built up over months of getting to know the children and their families. However, the list also contained children not on the school radar with low level or increasing vulnerabilities, demonstrating the importance of data alongside professional judgement in identifying vulnerabilities early."
