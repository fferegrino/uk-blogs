It\u2019s a huge job and we need services that let people and businesses tell us about changes quickly and easily. We also need systems that let caseworkers process all these changes so we have an up-to-date and accurate record of land and property ownership."

Applications coming into HM Land Registry range from a simple change of name to extremely complicated legal situations or changes in multiple ownership."

This is a big piece of work with lots of interesting problems to be solved. We work closely with developers and testers to find ways to solve problems. I really value being able to speak regularly with developers and understand how our designs will get built."

Accessibility considerations are also incredibly important. We\u2019ve been able to hold research sessions with the Disabled Employee Network who have provided valuable insights."
        },
        {
            "text": "During research, caseworkers said they find Application Processing easier to use and the language simpler than the system they used previously. The challenge will be keeping this approach as we design for more and more complex types of application."

            "text": "Ultimately, the better we can make Application Processing, the better it will be for caseworkers, solicitors and anyone who has ever bought or sold property. It\u2019s satisfying to be part of something with such wide-reaching implications."
