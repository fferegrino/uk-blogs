There\u2019s not a \u2018typical\u2019 day in this role.\u00a0 I usually do an early morning workout before the rest of the house is up, followed by a dog walk. If I\u2019m out on farm then I\u2019ll gather all my field kit (Land Inspection Device, backpack, maps, PPE, phone, food and drink) and double check everything is charged and working. "

            "text": "I\u2019m currently covering three counties so it can take a little while to drive to some of the holdings. I\u2019m trained in most of the environmental schemes and it depends on the time of year as to what scheme I\u2019m undertaking a visit for. I\u2019m currently switching between Sheep and Goat visits and Insitu Visits but come January, the focus will shift to Cattle Identification Visits."

            "text": "When I\u2019m not out on a farm there\u2019s a fair amount of preparation required before conducting each visit, followed by re-mapping to do and reports to write up following each one."

            "text": "Because Field Officers do a lot of chopping and changing between schemes, I make sure I give myself time to read guidance and refresh my knowledge on each scheme.\u00a0 Farming has seen lots of change in the past few years and it\u2019s important to keep abreast of those changes and current rural affairs, so I can impart my knowledge to the farmer."

            "text": "I think that changing our role from \u2018Inspectors\u2019 to \u2018Field Officers\u2019 and moving to \u2018visits\u2019 rather than \u2018inspections\u2019 have helped change farmer opinions of the RPA for the better. Field Officers can now spend more time offering guidance and support to farmers and they really welcome this and it\u2019s encouraged their trust in, and respect of, RPA. I\u2019m certainly experiencing a more relaxed and transparent relationship between ourselves and farmers."

            "text": "Generally, the feedback has been positive and farmers have warmed to us. Our visits give us the opportunity to offer farmers guidance and support in an ever-changing environment, not penalise and find fault. This is generally welcomed and appreciated but I cannot lie and say we\u2019re welcomed by every farmer we visit. I\u2019ve had some tricky interactions over the years and it has taken every ounce of my customer service skills to persuade farmers to allow me on farm to complete a visit.\u00a0 I recognise that farmers get frustrated but I don\u2019t take it personally.\u00a0 I\u2019m patient and honest and give farmers time and space."

            "text": "For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve had a fascination with animals and the environment.\u00a0 I did a GCSE in Agricultural Science and have worked with animals from a young age, initially a Saturday job as a Kennel and Cattery Maid and then as a volunteer Primate Keeper at London Zoo while I was at university. I graduated with a BSC Honours degree in Zoology and took a gap year to travel and work on a 103,000 acre sheep and cattle station in the Australian outback. On my return to the UK I got a job as a Farm Manager at a Llama Farm and worked there for eight years before starting a family. I decided to return to work when my son started school and I wanted an active job where I could utilise my agricultural experience, but have more flexibility."

I have a dog and live on the coast by the South Downs, so can enjoy long family walks in the countryside or warm Summer days on the beach.\u00a0 My son is at secondary school so I\u2019m often ferrying him about to different clubs and I\u2019m the administrator for his rugby team.\u00a0 This involves processing registrations, booking referees, arranging catering and being a general cheerleader!\u00a0 I love cooking and travelling and after our foreign trips were cancelled during the pandemic, we decided to buy a caravan.\u00a0 It\u2019s been great exploring the UK as a family and we love our little home on wheels."
