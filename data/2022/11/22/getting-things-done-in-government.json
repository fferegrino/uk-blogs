These are important skills because they are linked to the cross-cutting needs we have in government to deliver against our policies. Not every civil servant needs to be an expert in every area, but having some awareness of the skills that inform policy making and public service delivery will make us all better civil servants. We have these gaps because, although we have functions and professions to develop specialists, we haven\u2019t previously placed as much emphasis on the need for these skills.\u00a0"

Now, we need to work with our experts to provide universal training for every civil servant wherever you are, whatever level you are."

            "text": "The Government Campus transforms training and development for all civil servants. Strand 1 of the Government Campus curriculum focuses on the universal skills that we all need wherever we work, whereas Strand 2 (Working in government) focuses on the skills we need to get things done in government. The latter provides valuable training to support decision-making and manage public money. There is also training about other professions, to know when and how to work with them. Taking the time now to sharpen your skills in these areas will better help you work with your colleagues across government in the future."

Our collective highest spend (more than \u00a36 million) is on technical and specialist accredited courses within Strand 4 of the curriculum: project delivery; digital and data. A close second, approximately \u00a35.5 million, are Strand 3 products and programmes, for leadership and management. Clearly this doesn\u2019t capture all spending on learning and development (L&D), however it does show that there is more we must do in the universal skill space."

This is an ongoing process to ensure the curriculum and campus are shaping demand and assuring high quality and accessible supply of training.\u00a0"
