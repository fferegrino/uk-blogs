RPA\u2019s Operational Mapping Team tracks over 2.5million land parcels, using a range of intelligence and technology. In this blog Operational Mapping Lead David Franks talks about how he and his team provide accurate mapping for farmers and land managers. "

I initially joined on a temporary contract working in the RLE1 processing team and have worked in or around the wider mapping team my whole career. Outside work I enjoy spending time with my family and managing my sons\u2019 sports teams. Mapping is key to the administration of RPAs land-based schemes. Approximately 75% of the land in England is registered as over 2.5 million land parcels on our land system. Maintaining the integrity of our land system allows RPA to make timely and accurate payments to our customers."

We ensure mapping updates are effectively delivered into our Land Management System to support land-based schemes and we\u2019re constantly looking for opportunities to improve our processes."

            "text": "Technology underpins everything we do throughout the mapping process, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do our jobs without it. We use three main reference data sets alongside the information provided by customers; Ordnance Survey data, Aerial Photography and Satellite Imagery. These data sets are constantly being updated and are used to validate land parcels, identify where updates need to made and to prevent fraud. The quality of the data is increasing all the time, allowing us to make changes with a higher degree of accuracy and confidence."

            "text": "One of the hardest parts of the Mapping Team\u2019s job is to manage the volume of work. We receive almost 50% of the yearly land changes within a three-month period, which puts us under a lot of pressure during this time. The best part of the mapping team\u2019s job is working with maps and helping farmers. Farmers can help to make our job easier by providing clearly annotated maps as this helps to reduce the time taken to process mapping changes and may reduce the need for further clarification conversations."

            "text": "During the COVID pandemic we introduced an email route for submitting RLE1 forms. This was a new approach, but one that has been very popular, making it easier and cheaper for farmers to submit mapping changes. We appreciate that during our peak times of the year it can take a long time for these changes to be implemented so we are currently working on solutions to speed up the end-to-end turnaround of mapping changes. We\u2019re looking to improve our online guidance, and also to improve understanding about what we do and why."

            "text": "The most recent improvement to the mapping process was for SFI. We delivered an online functionality that allows farmers to tell us about simple land cover changes without the need to contact the help line or send in an RLE1 form. We\u2019re hoping to develop this further and make it available to all in 2023."

We\u2019re aware that our system capabilities aren\u2019t as advanced as some of the technologies being used within the farming sector, so we\u2019re trying to catch up to make it easier for farmers to communicate changes with us."
