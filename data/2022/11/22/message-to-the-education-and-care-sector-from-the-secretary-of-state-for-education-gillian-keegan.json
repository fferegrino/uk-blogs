            "text": "The autumn statement announced that schools will receive \u00a32bn in extra funding, which is over and above what has been previously committed both next year and the year after and is the biggest injection of funding ever. This has been backed up by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which said that it would allow schools to return to at least 2010 levels in real terms \u2013 the highest spending year in history \u2013 and is what the sector said it needed."

His belief in me and the extra O levels I passed, changed my life. Thanks to him, I was able to get onto an apprenticeship which opened all manner of doors. This is the alchemy of education in action. It not only builds confidence and opportunities but helps level up communities and leads to greater social justice and prosperity."

            "text": "I know without a doubt that talent is equally spread across the country but sadly, opportunity is not. I passionately believe no matter where you are from or what stage of life you\u2019re at, you should always be able to get a high-quality education."

            "text": "In our schools we need a full and knowledge-rich curriculum, with high standards in reading, writing and maths. Allied to that, we also need to make sure that pupils do not miss out because their lessons are disrupted by poor behaviour. No child should fall behind because their needs have not been spotted or supported."

            "text": "Keeping children safe and cared for is paramount. That means improving children\u2019s social care. We are rolling out family hubs and putting more money into the Supporting Families Programme. We are also committed to an implementation strategy for the independent review of children\u2019s social care, the National Panel review into the murders of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson and the Competition and Markets Authority report on the placements market. I am determined that this system should work more effectively for children and families, so that our most vulnerable children get every opportunity to achieve their potential."

In Robert Halfon I have a fellow apprenticeship champion. He has been a vocal and dedicated spokesman for the importance of skills as chair of the Education Select Committee for more than five years. I am so pleased that Baroness Barran is continuing to represent the Department in the House of Lords and I welcome her experience and passion for excellence for all. Claire Coutinho is a comparative newcomer to our department but she brings huge experience from a variety of previous roles to inform our focus on those with learning disabilities, special needs and social care."
