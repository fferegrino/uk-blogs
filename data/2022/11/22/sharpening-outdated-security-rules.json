            "text": "In 2018, the Salisbury poisonings were a clear statement of the threat we face. It was a tragic, and very public, glimpse into\u00a0the new era of threats we face."

            "text": "While our intelligence and security agencies have been deterring and stopping attacks directed by hostile foreign powers for some years, this brought home the dangers they now pose to our people and freedoms."

            "text": "The recent threats we have faced have made it clearer to us that our laws and powers are outdated. Our security and intelligence agencies have told us they need a modern armoury of law to meet the new threats. This government is answering that call."

            "text": "Existing counter-espionage laws\u00a0were drafted before the rise of Nazi Germany or the fall of the Soviet Union, when there were clear definitions of enemy and friend, and when spying meant stealing aircraft plans or printed documents."

            "text": "The recent case of British individuals\u00a0selling their advanced military training in China shows how the threat has changed. Now we\u2019re not just guarding physical documents,\u00a0but advanced research, tacit knowhow and the people who hold that knowledge. Our rivals know that the battlefield for strategic advantage lies in the race for cutting-edge science and technology."

            "text": "The tools we need to address this threat need to be sharpened for a different future.

            "text": "Another major reform in this Bill is new tools to tackle the rising challenge of foreign interference. The Bill introduces an offence of foreign interference and has also introduced provisions which will increase the sentencing for electoral offences where there is a state threats link."

            "text": "It introduces a foreign influence registration scheme, which will require individuals and companies to register certain activities undertaken on behalf of a foreign state. Anyone lobbying parliamentarians on behalf of a foreign state-backed company will have to declare it. Failure to register will constitute a criminal offence."

            "text": "Until now, we have been limited only to existing laws on harassment and assault to tackle them in extreme cases. For the first time, this Bill will make it illegal to act as an undeclared spy or take money to work on behalf of a foreign intelligence service. This is an important step which reflects the seriousness of state-backed violence and intimidation."
