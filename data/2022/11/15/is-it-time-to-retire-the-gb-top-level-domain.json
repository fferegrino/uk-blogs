You are probably familiar with top-level domains like .com, .org, and .net. But, there are also top-level domains for countries. For example, New Zealand has .nz, Germany has .de, and China has .\u4e2d\u56fd."

The only domain which is registered, though inactive, is hmg.gb - standing for His Majesty's Government.\u00a0 The domain was originally created in the mid 1980s, and abandoned at some point in the 1990s. There are no active domains which use .gb and today, the government only uses .gov.uk for its domains."
