We\u2019re more than halfway through the transition period for the Register of Overseas Entities, and I urge you to comply with your new responsibilities and register well before the deadline if you\u2019re in scope."

This legislation will fundamentally change our role and our purpose and will give us the powers we need to play a more significant role in tackling economic crime. Over time, we\u2019ll become an active gatekeeper of the data on our registers rather than a passive recipient, and we\u2019ll have the tools to go further to prevent the misuse of corporate entities."

However, it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that this openness exposes the UK to criminals who want to use our corporate structures for illicit purposes. This is one of the things the new Bill will address."

We know that economic crime threatens everyone, from global businesses to individuals. As well as having the tools to contribute to the fight against economic crime, I want to be able to help those people who have had their identity stolen, their home address used illegally, or had their companies hijacked. These new powers will allow me to do that."

This shift will not happen overnight, but you\u2019ll start to see a visible difference in the way we respond to suspected fraud and other suspicious activities when we have our new powers."

I\u2019ll be thinking carefully about where it\u2019s appropriate to challenge, and where we need to prioritise ease of doing business for those law-abiding companies. I\u2019ll be keeping the government\u2019s aim of making the UK the best place to start and grow a business at the forefront of my mind when I\u2019m making these decisions."
