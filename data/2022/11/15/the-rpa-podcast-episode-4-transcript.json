In today\u2019s programme, we\u2019ll be hearing about the Rural Payments Agency\u2019s more collaborative approach to inspections and visits, and the improvements you can expect to see in the coming months. We\u2019ll also be taking some time to understand the RPA\u2019s geospatial mapping process and learning about the exciting changes that the RPA hope will transform the mapping experience for farmers. As we approach December\u2019s Basic Payments Scheme payments window, we\u2019ll be discussing BPS progressive reductions and understanding how the combination of progressive reductions and advance payments will impact this year\u2019s window. And later in the episode I\u2019m delighted to say we\u2019ll hear from farming ambassador and RPA colleague, Norma Boyes MBE, as she reflects on how farming has changed, and continues to change, for women in agricultural roles and communities, as we mark October\u2019s International Day of Rural Women."

Exploring how the RPA can work more collaboratively with farmers during the inspections process has been a priority for the RPA and I\u2019m delighted to say I\u2019m joined by Richard Anderson, who leads the Field Officer teams at the RPA, to talk about a new partnership-based approach to visits. Richard, thanks for joining us today."

        {
            "text": "Richard: So, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve introduced a more supportive, partnership-based approach to inspections, moving away from the penalty-based system under the EU - where there was frequently a default to payment reduction - to a more farmer-focused visit for schemes such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive and Countryside Stewardship. Our visits - we aren\u2019t calling them inspections anymore - now cover the checks we need to do, and our Inspectors are now referred to as Field Officers."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And will the purpose of the visits remain the same?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Richard: Well, our Field Officers will continue to carry out visits for control purposes because we\u2019re giving out public funds but with the aim of supporting farmers by offering greater levels of advice, guidance and signposting to help improve compliance with standards and scheme requirements. So, for example, as part of this supportive approach, we\u2019ve introduced a new visit record checklist. This will help inform farmers of their responsibilities, and farmers and land managers can also expect a summary of the visit on Cross Compliance and Countryside Stewardship Domestic visits, including any advice and guidance that we\u2019ve given, as well as what\u2019s going well in the agreement. We then want to use this insight, in combination with other data sources, to help all our scheme participants meet their obligations."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: That all sounds really positive Richard, and it sounds like the Field Officer\u2019s role has also evolved?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Richard: It has. We undertake more than 6,500 visits each year, supporting the farming, food production and food trader sectors across England. Their role is to visit farm premises to ensure farmers and claimants are complying with UK and legacy EU legislation, scheme rules, and agreement options. But our Field Officers are a fantastic source of advice and guidance on holdings as well as remotely, supporting farmers, livestock and landowners with their applications and compliance. Going forward, our advice and guidance activity will increase as we work with farmers and land managers to help them secure the outcomes of their agreements, prior to checking compliance with scheme controls."
        },

            "text": "James: And I believe this is just the start of the process with further improvements to come?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Richard: Yes, absolutely James. We\u2019ve already delivered a number of initiatives, but our aim is to improve the experience further through, for example, reducing the visit burden by using information from our remote observation activities to increase the number of checks we\u2019re able to do without the need for field visits. We\u2019ll also continue to listen to feedback and refine our approach to field visits and making things more straightforward where we can."
        },

            "text": "Richard: Absolutely. Farmers and rural communities are at the heart of what we do, and we strive to provide excellent delivery and outcomes that are in the public interest. We\u2019ll continue to support farmers and land managers through the agricultural transition, seeking to place profitable and sustainable farming and food production at the forefront of environmental good practice. We share their passion for high quality food production and a flourishing environment, and we\u2019ll continue to seek ways to help them meet scheme obligations in a way that reflects your commitment and our duties in managing public funds."

I\u2019m now joined by Rachael Dale, Head of Geospatial Services at the RPA, to explore this further. Rachael, thanks for your time today."

        },
        {
            "text": "James: Rachael, before we move onto the improvements, please can you just explain a little about the geospatial mapping process?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, of course. So geospatial, or location, data is an umbrella term for any data that has a location element. It tells us where people and objects are in relation to a particular geographic location whether in the air, on the ground, or at sea. So RPA maps around 2.6million land parcels \u2013 which we mean by fields \u2013 and we do this by using a range of intelligence such as notifications by the submission of an RLE1 form, Ordinance Survey and also through technology, and we use this to keep the mapping data as accurate as possible. When we process claims for payments we check this mapping data against the claim data we get from farmers and if there are any differences we have to resolve it. We also undertake an activity every year where we use aerial photography, satellite imagery and Ordnance Survey, which has been acquired that year, to check against any parcels that haven\u2019t been updated over three years. And so each year, we always have a mixture of zones across England and these are selected each year and digitisers compare the images to the claims we receive and our mapped land parcels and land covers. My team map physical land parcel boundaries and features, such as hedges, so accurate payments can be made to farmers."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And you receive a significant number of land mapping changes each year?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, we do. So, RPA currently receives over 20,000 RLE1 forms each year requesting mapping changes, and the majority of these are submitted during a two-month window from mid-April to mid-June, so a timely turnaround is reliant on farmers and land managers providing accurate information. This is also important as farmers need to ensure their digital maps correctly show agricultural land parcels on their holding so they\u2019re able to apply for, or claim, for rural payments. If the data on the RLE1 form is inaccurate or incomplete, or maps are incorrect or go missing, this can lead to mapping change delays."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: We heard earlier about the new approach to visits, and your team plays a key role in this process?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: So, yes, we\u2019re beginning to increase the use of the latest satellite imagery to reduce the visit burden. We\u2019ll use this information to monitor scheme controls and areas where advice is being requested. And it will also help us to support our farmers and land managers to meet outcomes\u00a0 \u00a0before Field Officers visit."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Great, thanks Rachael. So, can you tell us a little about your plans for the months ahead?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, so over the next year, we\u2019ll explore digital options that can be accessed online, whilst ensuring we maintain accessibility for all farmers and land managers. We\u2019re excited at the difference these changes will make and will be seeking feedback to look at the best way to improve the experience."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And what will these improvements look like?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: So, we\u2019re exploring options to allow farmers and land managers to amend their land details online which is aiming to reduce the amount of time to submit a land change and also improving our processing times. Options are currently being reviewed, so I can\u2019t go into detail as yet, but we\u2019ll outline these further at a later date."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So this will build on the changes made just a couple of years ago?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, that\u2019s right. So, in March 2020 we launched a new RLE1 process, which gave the option of completing a digital RLE1 form. It\u2019s proven a very popular submission route, with over 75% of the forms now being received via email."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And I believe this is particularly important with the new Environmental Land Management schemes in mind?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, it is. So unlike the Basic Payment Scheme and Countryside Stewardship applications, new schemes like the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme can\u2019t proceed if there\u2019s any mapping work outstanding, also if a land cover currently on a claim isn\u2019t eligible for a particular SFI standard. So these improvements would shorten the turnaround times and streamline the process to meet the needs of farmers in current and new schemes. And it will greatly improve the time it takes to submit a land change and there will be continual improvements as we move forward in this area, based on feedback from the farmers."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: You mentioned earlier the importance of farmers providing accurate information, so how can our listeners ensure a smooth process?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: There are a few things farmers can do to ensure timely updates. You can help us by making sure all the required fields are completed within the RLE1 form, making clear annotations on any maps, and responding promptly to RPA requests for further information and also by following the guidance when emailing RLE1 forms. When you send an RLE1 form to RPA to make mapping changes to your registered land, it\u2019s important you send accurate sketch maps as well."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And where can farmers and land managers find the information relating to their holding?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: You can see digital maps of all the land parcels registered to your holding using the Rural Payments Service on GOV.UK. If the digital maps don\u2019t show your land correctly, you can make changes in the Rural Payments Service or by filling in an RLE1 form. And an RLE1 form also needs to be used to register a land parcel for the first time or to make any other changes."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And finally Rachael, on a related point, I understand you\u2019re also exploring the use of data to help support farmers affected by extreme weather?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Rachael: Yes, that\u2019s right James. We\u2019re testing the use of free satellite data captured over a regular cycle throughout the year to identify land that may be impacted by natural events such as floods and in particular this year where we\u2019ve seen wildfires. The plan would be that the results will be integrated with our mapping data for RPA to reach out to our farmers and land managers to provide support around meeting the scheme requirements."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And that sounds like another potentially exciting and innovate piece of work. Rachael, thank you for joining us today and we\u2019ll look forward to welcoming you back to hear more about developments during 2023."

            "text": "Kenny: Yes, of course. So as I\u2019m sure your listeners are aware, the Basic Payment Scheme \u2013 or BPS - is a rural payment that provides financial help to the farming industry. Direct payments are being phased out by 2027, through progressive reductions, and these were introduced in the 2021 scheme year. And as you said in your introduction, 2022 Direct payments will see a further step in the reductions made. The other key factor this year is we\u2019ve seen the permanent change in the frequency of payments, with the introduction of two instalments - we brought in advances from July and August, and balances from December."

        {
            "text": "Kenny: Yes, clearly with around 50% of the overall payment issued earlier this year for the majority of claimants, we would urge farmers to remind themselves of what they have received and what they expect, prior to the opening of the payment window in December."

        },
        {
            "text": "Kenny: The money from progressive reductions is reinvested in a new scheme to support farming and the countryside, such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive and the Farming Investment Fund. We understand the importance of cashflow to rural businesses and I would urge all farmers and land managers to explore the opportunities available through the current schemes and grants relevant to them."

            "text": "Kenny: I\u2019m pleased to say they are. Advance payments and the delivery of other schemes have placed an increased workload on my team, but they\u2019ve done an incredible job and we\u2019re on-track for December."

        {
            "text": "Kenny: I would recommend using the online calculator\u00a0available on GOV.UK, to find out how progressive reductions could affect your BPS payment \u2013 not just this year but for the reductions during scheme years 2021 to 2024. It\u2019s important to highlight here that you don\u2019t need to enter any personal information to use the calculator. The results are an estimate based on the progressive reduction figures set out in the\u00a0Farming is Changing leaflet\u00a0and the data you enter. Further information on BPS progressive reductions and advance payments can also be found on GOV.UK."

        {
            "text": "Kenny: Yes, sadly we have seen examples of fraudsters targeting farmers who receive subsidy payments and we\u2019re aware that in the past some farmers and land managers have received emails and telephone calls claiming to be from RPA or Defra. Links to a fake website designed to look like the authentic RPA or Defra online service are sometimes included in the message. It\u2019s important to highlight here we don\u2019t send emails or text messages with links to websites asking you to confirm your personal details or payment information. So, we strongly advise anyone who receives such a request not to open the link and delete the item."

            "text": "Kenny: Yes, I think there are four key things to remember. First of all, never discuss your bank account details with someone you don\u2019t know. Secondly, we won\u2019t ask you to make a payment over the phone. Thirdly, delete any emails or texts you don\u2019t believe are genuine, and don\u2019t open any links. And finally, be cautious about what information you share externally, particularly on social media. Again, you can find further advice on the RPA\u2019s pages on GOV.UK."

It\u2019s like any gender issue, there\u2019s still a long way to go, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re exclusive to farming. It wasn\u2019t that the participation by women wasn\u2019t there, it was that it wasn\u2019t recognised. The farmers\u2019 wives and daughters always worked but it was the sons that were part of the\u2026the eldest son inherited the farm and that was it. Whereas now, it\u2019s who\u2019s best placed to do that, who wants to do that. One example, I think is very successful, is one of my cousins. His son didn\u2019t want the farm, his daughter did and her husband, and they\u2019ve taken it on. It\u2019s a local farm and they\u2019ve also diversified, so they\u2019re building on that. And maybe because it\u2019s a woman, she sees more opportunities, and they\u2019ve got a wedding barn which is very successful, three barns, and they\u2019ve now diversified again with the support of grants, and they\u2019re doing cheese. It\u2019s finding its feet and it\u2019s very successful. Whereas they wouldn\u2019t have been given that opportunity. It would\u2019ve either been the farm would have been sold or the son would\u2019ve taken over and that\u2019s how, I think it\u2019s important. It isn\u2019t happening everywhere, but it is starting to happen, which I think is key."

And I think it\u2019s utilising what is available and recognising that actually they have different strengths and I think that\u2019s with all types of work isn\u2019t it. That\u2019s what I think is important, that there\u2019s a recognition that you can work smarter, you don\u2019t have to make it such hard work."

She not only promoted the horses, the dogs, she actually showed pedigree cattle and sheep at the agricultural shows. She had her roots in the countryside, and I think we couldn\u2019t have had a better role model than her. One of the other people who I think was very influential in years gone by was Beatrix Potter, Mrs Heelis. What she did was in effect create the National Trust. Her farms were the foundation for the National Trust. I was actually judging at Loweswater Show and I realised that she was actually the first female president of Loweswater Show in 1938. I\u2019m addicted, since I was a child, to Beatrix Potter, I must have one-hundred-and-fifty ornaments of the Beswick ornaments. But of the more modern ones, I think it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had\u2026National Farmers Union\u2026it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve had a female president. And Minette Batters is the president now and she is a farmer in her own right, and she leads a strong representation. I think she\u2019s a role model for anybody that can aspire to be and take those roles."

            "text": "Norma: I would say look for opportunities, don\u2019t be afraid to diversify, look for grants that we\u2019re giving out, and support and training, take advantage of everything that\u2019s available. I think you need to be aware of where you want to be and work towards that, without too much risk. Defra, and Rural Development and the RPA, they\u2019ve all got various grants schemes that are available if you\u2019ve got land or if you want to buy equipment. And again, local colleges supply lots of training and lots of it if you haven\u2019t made it to university then there are still opportunities to do things within your own environment and build on that. If you\u2019re going into farming or you\u2019re diversifying into something else, you need to have a sound business background, and you need to get that before you start to do things. But nobody\u2019s going to do it for you, so you have to look and be prepared to put yourself in that situation."
