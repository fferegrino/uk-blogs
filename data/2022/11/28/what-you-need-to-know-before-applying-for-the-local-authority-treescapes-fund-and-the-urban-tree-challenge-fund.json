It is available to anyone who has management control of the land, including local authorities and private landowners, to level up access to nature across the country.

Group applications from multiple local authorities within an upper tier local authority area are still strongly encouraged, as partnership working maximises the shared benefits for each partner, and groups will therefore score more highly and will be more likely to receive funding."

We have also increased the menu of standard cost items to include payment rates for planting in a range of surfaces and undertaking trial pits and removed the older multiple funding thresholds for different sizes of grants (and now only have a minimum application value of \u00a310,000)."

Smaller \u2018whips\u2019 are much cheaper to buy and maintain, and establish their roots more quickly than larger trees - catching up in size with larger specimens in as little as three to five years. However, whips aren\u2019t suited to all areas: so, you could also think about larger \u2018standard\u2019 trees which provide immediate benefits to communities and are more robust against vandalism."
