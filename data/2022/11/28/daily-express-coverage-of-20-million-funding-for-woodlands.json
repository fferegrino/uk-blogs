            "text": "Defra and the Forestry Commission have jointly announced the recipients of three different funds aimed at accelerating tree planting, boosting domestic timber production and supporting innovative approaches to many of the greatest threats facing our trees, woodlands and forests \u2013 namely, climate change and the growing prevalence of pests and diseases. Announced as part of National Tree Week, the three funds are the Woods into Management Forestry Innovation Funds, the Tree Production Innovation Fund and the Woodland Creation Accelerator Fund. The latter will support local authority tree planting initiatives which will see hundreds of thousands of trees planted in communities across England."

            "text": "National Tree Week marks the beginning of another crucial planting season and offers a moment for us to reflect on the importance of the trees, woodlands and forests at the heart of our natural landscapes. They protect us against flooding, provide habitats for our precious native wildlife and are nature\u2019s ultimate carbon capture machines. They are an important source of jobs too, directly employing over 30,000 and contributing more than \u00a32billion to our economy every year. In the face of climate change and the growing prevalence of pests and diseases, it is imperative that we plant more trees, whilst simultaneously building their resilience. So I am delighted to mark the beginning of National Tree Week 2022 with a major \u00a320million funding package, made possible through our landmark Nature for Climate Fund. Over 100 projects championed by tree nurseries, charities and businesses will be funded to bring the latest innovations to the forestry sector and address some of the greatest threats facing our treescapes. Local authorities across the country will receive significant funding to kickstart tree planting activity, create new green jobs and boost access to nature. The value of trees to people and nature has never been clearer, and I know Express readers have been particularly inspired by the paper\u2019s campaign to make space for nature so I am sure readers will need no extra encouragement to get involved and plant a tree."
