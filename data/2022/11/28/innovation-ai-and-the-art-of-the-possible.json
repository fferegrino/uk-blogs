            "text": "Advances are rapidly being made and there were some great examples of how AI is being used shared at the summit, particularly across healthcare service delivery. Virtual assistants are used to navigate appointments, accessing advice promptly and supporting check-ups. Health issues can be diagnosed using mobile apps much easier through the use of digital imagery that can be processed using neural network algorithms. This can provide quicker treatment and have great benefits in areas with limited access to medical equipment."

The Product community at Justice Digital are working with the Alan Turing institute to pilot learning in AI ethics, which is key when we think about making safe, sustainable choices around using AI in our products and services. Right now, we are developing collaborative relationships with our data colleagues to test the value of AI."

Whilst we may find ways in which virtual reality helps enhance experiences and quickly deliver services, I think there will always be a basic need to interact as humans in a physical environment. Will there ever be a world where government services exist in augmented reality and can be accessed and completed by wearing a pair of smart glasses, or through an AR enabled device?"

The greatest innovators and entrepreneurial minds are probably a little unconventional in government, but we should seek them out by bringing in experts, academics, data scientists and more."

            "text": "I\u2019d encourage anyone reading this to be curious \u2013 we all need to find ways in which we can feel more comfortable in trying new approaches and experimenting. Even if this leads to failure then that is successful in itself. Learning about what not to do is equally, if not more important, than finding out what to do."
