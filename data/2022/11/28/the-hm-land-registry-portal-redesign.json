This is the day the Digital Registration Service will become the default application submission service on the portal and the redesign is a key component in making it easier to submit digital applications."

This redesign won\u2019t be changing any of the services, but it will change how our customers use and interact with the portal \u2013 beginning with a personalised homepage."

Our objective is to support the development of a simpler, paperless, transparent and user-friendly process for buying and selling property. This update to the portal, and the move to digital by default, is a major milestone in achieving this objective which we hope will ultimately lead to better services and quicker applications, when combined with the other changes and updates we\u2019re making to our services and processes."
