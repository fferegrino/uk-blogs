Capella is a system of two stars - one nine times larger than our sun and the other more than twelve times as large."

            "text": "Auriga is a fascinating constellation.\u00a0 Those with darker skies away from towns and streetlights may be able to see that it sits in the pale band of our Milky Way galaxy, so if you have binoculars or a telescope, scan this patch of sky to reveal a beautiful swathe of stars and several dense star clusters."

            "text": "This part of the Milky Way is the outer arm of our galaxy, while looking west after dark towards the setting summer constellations is looking in towards the brighter, more densely star-packed centre of our galaxy."

            "text": "The Leonids is known to \u2018storm\u2019 every 33 years as Comet Tempel-Tuttle returns to the inner solar system, leaving a fresh trail of debris in its wake; the 1999-2001 Leonids showers produced thousands of meteors every hour at its peak!"

            "text": "Unfortunately, the next \u2018storm\u2019 is not due until the early 2030s, though meteor showers can put on a surprising display at any time, so it\u2019s always worth taking a look if the weather is clear during their peak."

            "text": "Did you know: Other planets encounter meteor showers too. Observations from NASA\u2019s \u2018Messenger\u2019 spacecraft that orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, suggest that Comet Encke showers Mercury with meteors too. However, Mercury does not have a protective atmosphere like Earth does, so rather than burn up in a streak across the sky, the comet fragments would pepper the surface creating countless new craterlets each Mercury year - the equivalent of around 88 Earth days."

While there are no crew on this flight (apart from Shaun the Sheep), later Artemis missions will return humans to the moon for the first time in over 50 years."
