Users were contacting our call centres, only to be given the same information that was already in the GOV.UK guidance."

In fact, 9 out of 10 of the surveyed case administrators felt that users did not read through the online guidance before contacting the service centre. This strengthened our assumption that the OCMC service users could be missing out on important guidance due to the design of the service start point on GOV.UK."

We made a request with the Government Digital Service (GDS) to update the 'Make a court claim' page. We removed the separate \u2018start page\u2019 and added the OCMC service \u2018start now\u2019 button to the mainstream guidance. These changes streamlined the GOV.UK mainstream guidance access for OCMC users across all stages of the journey, meaning users should no longer accidentally miss important guidance."
