Topics are a set of pages covering a wide range of services and guidance, which users can then drill down into and find what they need. Topics include things like benefits or visas and immigration. By navigating through the topic, users can narrow down to what they specifically need, for example managing their tax credits or checking if they need a visa."

Mobile users were opening the expanding sections at a lower rate than those on desktop, and at a lower rate than we would expect so we wanted to investigate that further.\u00a0"

We decided to test a new design, which uses a flat list with subheadings and dividers to organise the content. You can see that design below."
