Agents need subject matter expertise and are liable for correctly verifying the information given to them by entities."

If you\u2019re acting upon or are one of the parties involved in the purchase, contractually you must allow for the new legislative requirements so that you do not run into issues down the line. An example is a conveyancer whose seller involves an overseas entity. If the new requirement is not satisfied, the recipient could potentially be liable for receiving criminal funds, which is an offence. There is also more risk to parties in a property transaction where there is an overseas entity in the chain."
