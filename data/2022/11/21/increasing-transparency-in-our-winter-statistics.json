Health security hazards like these require a coordinated response across the public health system to ensure the health of the nation is secure and protected. Statistics and analysis are an important enabling tool for this."

Our approaches align with the standards and principles set out in the Code of Practice for Statistics and regulatory guidance on the transparent use and release of data."

This augments the statistics release calendar where our official statistics are announced at least 4 weeks in advance of publication. We hope that this transparency around what we plan to publish and when, will provide the information different users need for planning purposes."

However, the analysis goes on year-round, enabling us to provide support to various public health incidents such as heatwaves, air pollution episodes or situations where the risk of disease transmission is high, such as at mass gatherings."
