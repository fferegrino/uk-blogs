To celebrate, we asked James Lamb and Sam Birch from our Applied Fisheries Science & Technology team to tell us what life is like as a fisheries observer on board the Carhelmar BM23, where they conduct the Western Channel sole and plaice survey; one of the longest running surveys of its kind."

The FSP was established to build relationships between fishermen and scientists and to get fishermen more actively involved in the science. The survey has been running every year since 2003 and provides valuable data for stock assessments."

We also collect data for other valuable commercial species such as cod, lemon sole, megrim, monkfish and cuttlefish, alongside important data for over 50 species of fish and shellfish that make up the retained and discarded portions of the catch."

Within this area, 90 locations are sampled and these \u2018prime stations\u2019 are repeated every year. A few different vessels have been chartered for this survey over the years, but since 2009 the FV Carhelmar has been chartered for both the Eastern and Western survey annually."

            "text": "This data is important for the UK fishing industry as it helps to monitor fish stocks and contributes to advice on fishing opportunities. The survey datasets are incorporated into assessments by large scientific bodies, such as International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), who provide evidence and advice on the conservation and management of fish species. As the survey methodology has been relatively consistent across the time-series, the data has been used as part of the ICES stock assessment for Western Channel plaice since 2007. Next years\u2019 FSP Western Channel Sole and Plaice survey will add the twentieth year to the time series, helping Cefas to continue its mission to embed marine and freshwater science at the heart of policy making."

There is a real legacy behind it, and it became somewhat of a bucket list survey for me as an observer.\u00a0 When I was asked if I wanted to get involved, I was excited to join a long line of Cefas scientists, past and present, to staff the survey."

            "text": "James Lamb: The survey design restricts sampling to daylight, and with 90 stations to complete, it can present a sizeable challenge. Life aboard the Carhelmar during the survey is busy, the trawls are towed for an hour at each prime station, and you need to sample the full catch \u2013 which is a lot of fish as a single catch can range from 50kg to several hundred kilograms, depending on what is being caught."
        },
        {
            "text": "Sam Birch: Catches are small compared to commercial tows, but full catch sampling with the low raising factors required for the survey makes it challenging to measure everything within the time available. Length measurements are taken from each species of fish (and commercial crustaceans) caught. Otoliths (calcium carbonate structures found inside the heads of bony fish) are extracted from sole and plaice for age analysis at the Cefas laboratory back in Lowestoft. Prime stations can be very close together, so you might only have an hour between hauls to collect and record all the required data before you start again. But the skipper and crew work closely with the scientists to ensure that each fishing location is sampled precisely and effectively."

Scientists and industry work closely together to achieve the survey aims, year after year, which is a real partnership requiring dedication and enthusiasm from all involved. It\u2019s fascinating to see how species diversity changes across the survey area, and how catches change year-to-year. Knowing that this survey contributes directly to the stock assessments and influences fishing opportunities makes you feel part of something worthwhile and valuable."

            "text": "James Lamb: It\u2019s a real collaborative effort with the crew. The daily life on board was great, the crew were friendly and welcoming, and we were certainly well fed. Each trawl is slightly different, and it\u2019s interesting to see how the catch changes as we move across the survey area. Species are caught more in certain areas than others. The sampling is quite different to how we sample on a commercial trip, so it's great to do something different from the usual work."
