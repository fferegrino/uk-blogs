It felt very surreal for the cameras and Mehreen Baig to be in the classroom. It was such a surprise when I saw the message from Janette Manrara and to then have Katya Jones visit. To receive a further message from Sir Rod Stewart was truly wonderful, it was a day that I will never forget. The positivity and feel-good factor for me personally, for our school and for the local community that has come from this award has been immeasurable. Eleven months later and I am still asked about it!"

I also found, as a parent, that it was very difficult to speak to my children\u2019s teacher at the start and end of the day. As a result, I make myself available for all our parents. Their child is important, and they deserve for me to give them and their child my time and best efforts."

All of our children in KS2 have an tablet and each class in KS1 and EYFS have a number of tablets to share. This gives children access to a range of learning opportunities, both inside and outside of the school day.

The most rewarding aspect of my job is seeing children\u2019s confidence increase. Also nurturing their self-belief - encouraging them to persevere and overcome obstacles to achieve their goal."
