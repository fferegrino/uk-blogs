Examples of inappropriate use include taking antibiotics for colds, sore throats, coughs and so on that are viral in origin, so cannot be treated by antibiotics."

MRSA is a common healthcare associated infection that has developed naturally to resist antibiotics, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death."

This is equivalent to 148 severe antibiotic resistant infections a day in 2021, although antibiotic resistant infections are at lower levels than before the pandemic. In the years before the pandemic started, we were seeing year-on-year higher increases. This is due to a number of factors including changes in how NHS services were delivered and how much people contacted the NHS, as well as social behaviour (reduced social mixing and enhanced hand hygiene) during the pandemic."

Those from the most deprived 10% of the country were more likely to have particularly serious forms of antibiotic resistant bugs, known as carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, compared to those from the least deprived 10% of the country (6.8 compared to 2.8 per 100,000 population). Understanding the impact of ethnicity, deprivation, regional divergence, along with potential confounders, remains an important area of investigation."

However, unless we continue to use antibiotics appropriately and continue to drive down infections overall, the trend may not be sustained."
