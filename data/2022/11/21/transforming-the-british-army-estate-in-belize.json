The programme has seen the much-needed replacement of the DIO Logistics Building, the refurbishment of the Sailfish Club recreational facility, and the installation of a new Water Treatment and Fire Suppression System. These facilities are essential for achieving the BATSUB mission, to \u201csupport and facilitate unit-delivered collective training in order to support the preparation of forces for readiness and operations.\u201d"

The contract was awarded during the COVID-19 lockdown, when BATSUB was reduced to minimal staffing levels and many of our DIO staff were re-deployed back to the UK. However, the expertise of the DIO Commercial team in working on overseas projects proved invaluable, helping to ensure a successful start to the programme despite the challenges involved."

Close collaboration with our industry partners and key stakeholders, including the BDF, was central throughout the programme and helped to ensure its successful completion in August 2022."
