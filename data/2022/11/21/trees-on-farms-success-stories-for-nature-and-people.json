Farmers are balancing a demand to grow nutritious food and materials, while ensuring the environment in which they are grown remains healthy. Many want the land in better condition for future generations and are eager to learn how best to mitigate risks to the environment and ultimately, their livelihoods. Trees play an important role in this balancing act between food, business, and the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

It is a 182 hectare business with a flock of sheep, cattle, cereal crops, agroforestry, and combination of arable and tree crops. David is an early adopter of agroforestry and its integration into arable fields, which is now a key element of the farm. Two fields of 15 acres include 3-metre-wide strips of grasses, wildflowers with fruit and nut trees at 24 metre intervals with arable crops between. This combination of arable crops and tree crops is known as a \u2018silvoarable\u2019 system. \u00a0"

By incorporating trees, Home Farm has also diversified and formed a strong connection with the local community through tree planting projects and woodland workshops. David is now in the process of creating a new, 2 acre hazel and willow agroforest. David says:"

            "text": "Incorporating trees and woodlands into the farm system can be challenging. It is an investment of time and resources which is why projects such as these are so important. Trees and woodlands bring management costs not typically incorporated into farming operations. For example, a risk to Newhouse Farm\u2019s young agroforestry plot has been the local deer population. The cost of deer fencing the in-field strips is unfeasible, but they are hoping enough trees survive to maturity. Managing diseased or dangerous trees also requires professional help and external resources. No farm is entirely the same; integrating trees into silvoarable or agroforestry systems, or creating new woodland, depends greatly on the farm\u2019s capacity to take chances and make changes with a long-term perspective, and on the support available to do so. Both David and Andy have a genuine ambition to integrate trees and habitats across their farm, produce food sustainably, and share their experiences with others. Thank you to them both for sharing their knowledge and experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
