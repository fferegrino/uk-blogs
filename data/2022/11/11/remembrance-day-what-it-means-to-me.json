It is, after all, a very emotional time for everyone, but one where we all know we\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs."

I\u2019d heard on the grapevine that a few guys from my old trade had started a private group on Facebook. I didn\u2019t know any of them, but I requested to join and that\u2019s where I found out they were doing Remembrance Day in London, and I requested to attend."

Our trade association is doing just that, gathering old kit and information from our time in our trade, and presenting this as part of a museum collection."

Whether physical or psychological; just because you can't see an injury, doesn't mean they\u2019re not broken."

Many of our brave men and women fought, died, were, or are, permanently injured physically and mentally, protecting people they didn't even know. That\u2019s why it's so important to remember."
