Their outdoor education lead, Julie Newman, shares how the school has taken action to support biodiversity in their grounds and beyond. "

The curriculum is crowded but, like many schools, we have begun to find ways to weave sustainability through the subjects we teach. Raising awareness of climate change and biodiversity is essential and it\u2019s vital that all pupils have the opportunity to bring about change. Otherwise, we run the risk of leaving young people with a sense of helplessness."

            "text": "Being part of the national Polli:Nation project prompted us to focus on pupil voice. We saw how, driven by a group of passionate pupils, action for biodiversity became part of the ethos of our school. Students devised their own PolliPromise campaign and began to engage the local community. Successive cohorts have taken this on board and, as part of X-Polli:Nation, the campaign became international."

They chose to focus on biodiversity and wellbeing because, as one of our pupils explained, without biodiversity there can be no wellbeing. The project has been threaded through the school curriculum and pupils share their actions through audio trails, videos, assemblies and tours."

By the time our pupils go to secondary school, we want them to have developed a love and respect for the natural world and feel empowered and confident in displaying pro-environmental behaviour.\u00a0 Nature engagement connects our pupils with each other and their environment. Many of our pupils do not have a garden or access to local greenspace, so school grounds are vital places. Exploring throughout the seasons helps develop a sense of place and belonging, which drives pupils to protect nature and bring about change."

Our team of garden volunteers work alongside our pupils using a buddy/mentoring approach that has worked well. We also have links with many local individuals and organisations. We share ideas and resources with other schools and groups, helping to build a support network. A blog to share ideas is available on the project website."

Enthusiasm for one species often spills over into another and \u00a0becoming increasingly aware of the inter connectedness of living things. Our grounds have become a better place for nature and an example of the power of cumulative, small changes. They are also a better place for people; many of our pupils speak of the calm and joy that comes from being in them. There is immense satisfaction in looking back and knowing you are part of positive change."
