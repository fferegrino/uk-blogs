This aims to embed a whole-prison approach to supporting complex needs."

One prisoner who had dyslexia told us she was given an hour of support each day. This prisoner had a history of vision and musculoskeletal problems. She had supervised rest breaks in tests, an ergonomic pen, and lighting adjustments in education and skills sessions. She was also provided with special seating in skills and work sessions."
