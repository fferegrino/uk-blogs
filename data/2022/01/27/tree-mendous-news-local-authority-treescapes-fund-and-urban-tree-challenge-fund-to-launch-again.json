However, our nations\u2019 trees are still under threat. Pests and diseases are depleting tree populations across the country. Ash dieback alone is predicted to cost Great Britain \u00a315bn over the next 100 years, with half of that value expected in the next decade."

            "text": "Replacing these lost trees is vital for several reasons. By replacing trees lost to stresses we will be protecting the delicate balance of native biodiversity within our treescapes, mitigating flood risks, protecting our rivers\u2019 fish stocks from heat and agricultural run-off, reducing noise and air pollution from busy roads, capturing carbon and locking it away, and maintaining the role of nature at the heart of communities."

            "text": "Yet tree replacement doesn\u2019t go far enough. We need to be planting more trees if we\u2019re going to meet the UK targets for net zero by 2050. Furthermore, a staggering 12% of the UK\u2019s children spend little or no time amongst nature; missing out on the health and wellbeing benefits that nature has to offer. This is concentrated amongst children from minority ethnic backgrounds and lower income homes in the most deprived areas of the country, and often in urban communities."

            "text": "The LATF is a grant scheme for local authorities (LAs), to drive an increase in non-woodland tree planting across our landscapes. The fund is focused on replanting trees outside of woodlands including trees in hedgerows, parklands, riparian zones, urban areas, beside roads and footpaths as well as small linear woodlands, copses, and shelterbelts. They are particularly valuable trees to society as they can provide the greatest levels of ecosystem services, including cultural benefits and support for biodiversity. The fund will also contribute greatly to landscape recovery from tree diseases such as ash dieback."

Projects will support a variety of ways to get trees in the ground, using both natural regeneration and traditional planting and with a strong focus on community engagement."

By requiring match funding from communities and local authorities, the UTCF drives value for money while also engaging local communities in efforts to fund-raise for, plant and maintain trees. The UTCF supports planting of large \u2018standard\u2019 trees and street trees \u2013 making an immediate impact to communities and ensuring other organisations who provide planting for smaller trees can continue to do so."
