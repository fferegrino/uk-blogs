The best way to reply to a written requisition is to use \u2018reply to requisition\u2019 within the portal as this is automatically added to your application."

At this stage we are not necessarily committing to the reintroduction of telephone requisitions as we want to be sure that any long-term solution provides real support for our customers as well as bringing greater efficiency \u2013 and therefore speed \u2013 to our services."
