Non-alcoholic beer for those undertaking Dry January, eco-friendly disinfectant for those keen to rid their homes and workplaces of a particular virus and a potential remedy to the fast-fashion crisis. Read on as I delve into the intellectual property (IP) issues raised in the Den."

This all changed when he was diagnosed with liver problems and decided to give up alcohol, leading him to set up his non-alcoholic beer business, Impossibrew."

            "text": "It seemed that it could be happy hour in the Den, with Touker declaring Wong \u2018the most credible twenty-four-year-old\u2019 that\u2019s ever walked into the Den, but it seemed his pitch had gone flat. Due to the infancy of the business, Touker felt there wasn\u2019t enough traction to make such a high valuation."

            "text": "Louis\u2019s pitch was off to a shiny start, but things quickly turned murky when pressed on the exclusivity of the product. After being questioned by Sara Davies on the exclusivity of the product, Louis explained that due to issues around Brexit, he lost the exclusive rights to sell the product just hours before his crucial pitch in the Den, leaving the Dragons feeling sympathy towards the young entrepreneur."

            "text": "Deborah Meaden sought clarification and Louis confirmed that he does own the branding (including the trade mark) of the product. This seemed to alleviate some concerns that the Dragons had, but without the exclusive distributorship, the valuation had become too optimistic for their liking."

            "text": "So what is trade mark protection? Trade marks are important as they distinguish your goods or services from others. Having trade mark protection has likely protected Louis in his predicament to the extent that if his brand is already established and well known, he would be able to continue selling the product successfully."

            "text": "Louis could add further value to his eco business by protecting the design of his bottles. Well-known clothing companies can often attract copycats who attempt to replicate their designs. However, registering your design can help to stop others from copying or stealing it. There are different types of unregistered design. How long you\u2019re protected for depends on the type of design. Find out more about here."

        {
            "text": "Aside from protecting her logo and branding with a trade mark, could Charlotte's business model be protected by a patent? It is very rare to obtain patent protection for a business method (it's more likely to be protected in the U.S.) however it's always advisable to speak with a patent attorney if you're unsure as to whether you could claim protection for your invention. You can find a patent attorney via the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys website here."
