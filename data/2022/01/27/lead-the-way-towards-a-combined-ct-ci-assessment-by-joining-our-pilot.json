Part of this work is the recently-launched combined review service for all new Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs), which provides a more streamlined and efficient service for research applicants."

Applicants just need to do a single application, thus facilitating rapid start up and potentially benefitting patients sooner."

We are calling on sponsors, research organisations and investigators running studies involving both a medicine (a clinical trial, CT) and a medical device (a clinical investigation, CI) to join our CT/CI coordinated assessment pilot and contribute to develop a new streamlined route within the combined review journey."
