            "text": "The Forestry Commission and Defra are drawing attention to the attractive grant schemes and free specialist advice available through their new Put Down Roots campaign. Woodland creation offers opportunities to diversify, generate extra income, increase farm productivity, and enhance land \u2013 without taking the best agricultural land out of use. Grants and support can help with the cost of designing, planting and managing trees. For example, with the England Woodland Creation Offer, farmers and landowners could receive over \u00a310,000 for every hectare of new woodland in England."

One of the first places to benefit from the England Woodland Creation Offer is Blenheim Estate in Oxfordshire, which has received funding to grow 270,000 trees and is expected to absorb 20,000 tonnes of Co2 over the next 25 years. The site will also benefit from 15km of new wooded footpaths for the public in and around the area. The announcement has since been covered by BBC News Online."

Farmers and landowners may also be able to transfer land in an existing Environmental Stewardship grant agreement into the England Woodland Creation Offer without penalty, subject to conditions."
