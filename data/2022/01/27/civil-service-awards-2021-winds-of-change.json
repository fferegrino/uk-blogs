Many people joined straight from school, got paid weekly in a brown paypacket,\u00a0 junior grades had their own office, no employee had a computer (everyone relied upon a typing pool), and many enjoyed a full day off for Christmas shopping. Below, our Lifetime Achievement Award winners round up some of the biggest changes across the Civil Service since joining."

My first desk didn\u2019t have a computer (I\u2019d wait another four years for that), and I didn\u2019t get an email account until 1999. We had masses of paper filing, of course. Whole rooms were devoted to files - some well-organised, some not."

The biggest change is how technology has changed the delivery of our core functions. Back then, computers were limited to the labs and guarded as something for the world of \u2018the scientist\u2019."

All paper (and I mean everything, including toilet paper) was stamped HMSO and people could smoke in offices, although not in the lab - things weren\u2019t quite that unsafe. The Civil Service has certainly moved on a fair bit since then."
