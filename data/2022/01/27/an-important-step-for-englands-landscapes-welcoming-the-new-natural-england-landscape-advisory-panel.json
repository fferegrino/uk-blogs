They are rightly renowned the world over: for the places they create, the history they reflect, their variety, beauty, inspiration; as spaces to relax, have fun or explore; and for the many natural, social and economic benefits they provide. Today we know that they are also rich in natural capital, for example huge stores of carbon held in peat, and landscapes that help to ensure that rivers run pure and steady, reducing flood risk in the process."
