It is crucial that everyone, no matter their role or seniority takes cyber accountability. As the cyber domain grows and we become more reliant on the internet and technology, the threat to our cyber safety is evolving and changing, making us more likely to become victim of a cyber-attack."

It is therefore crucial that people are engaged through memorable and novel ways of learning that gives an individual the opportunity to actively understand their role in protecting Defence through a hands-on or visual experience."

Not only was the room a test of teamwork, problem solving and decision making it also tested cyber security knowledge by teaching players how to identify possible threats to our security. We may come across such threats at work or even at home, both online and offline demonstrating the importance of ensuring we always present cyber secure behaviours."
