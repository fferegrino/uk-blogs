Many colleagues across our organisation have volunteered across England and found the experience incredibly rewarding. Read on to find out how Vicky\u2019s experience went."

I\u2019ve been doing my bit to help with the national vaccine effort. As civil servants, we get 5 paid days off a year to volunteer. Given the government\u2019s priority to get everyone boosted as soon as possible, the 5-day limit was temporarily lifted and we were all being encouraged to help out if we can. I stuck my hand up to try something different and be part of something bigger than the day job."

I was to welcome people arriving for their booster vaccines and show them to a free booth. As I\u2019ve spent the last 21 months working on my own it was quite exciting to interact with people in real life. I soon figured out those administering the vaccines were in a competition to see who could do the most in a day and I had the power to help them win or lose. Of course, I did my best to keep it fair."

I told them I\u2019m a civil servant and work for HMRC. Besides the usual jokes about tax returns, they were interested to hear that my profession is marketing and communications, I probably don\u2019t know any more about tax than they do and that there\u2019s actually lots of different types of roles at HMRC."
