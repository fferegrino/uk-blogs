Running an exam series where everyone takes the same assessments at the same time and in the same way, as the qualifications are designed, gives students the fairest chance to show what they know, understand and can do.\u00a0I look forward to more students having this opportunity in the summer."

This November, students were also eligible to enter if they were disappointed with their summer 2021 grade and wanted to improve this, or if they were unable to get a grade in the summer."

As the students are unlikely to be representative of those entering in a typical November or summer series, it is not possible to make comparisons between the outcomes this November and in previous years \u2013 or between outcomes in November and summer."

As in any exam series, one exam board might have a very able entry for a subject and see far more students getting higher grades, while another exam board might have a less able entry and might see much lower overall results."

            "text": "As outlined in a previous blog post, in a typical year, not all students who re-sit their exams improve their grade. This year, the November series was not a typical re-sit series, since students had not taken exams in the summer. We therefore cannot assume that every student will have improved their grade. Our analyses show that, of the students that have a grade from the summer, around a third have improved their grade, just over 40% have the same grade, and just under 25% received a lower grade in November."

            "text": "The aim of grading in November 2021 was to seek alignment, as far as possible, with summer 2021. This is different to summer 2022, when the aim of grading will be to reflect a midpoint between summer 2019 and summer 2021, to provide a safety net for students. So, you should not make any assumptions about likely grade boundaries in summer 2022 based on those for the November series."

            "text": "As you will be aware, we have worked together with the Department for Education and the exam boards to allow advance information about the focus of the content of exams in summer 2022. Combined with the choice of content or topics in some GCSEs, and a generous approach to grading, this constitutes a package of unprecedented aid and support, reflecting the disruption caused by the pandemic. Because this package as a whole is new, it is important that people don\u2019t try to predict grade boundaries. The most important thing to remember is that boundaries will only be determined once expert markers have marked exam papers."

I would also like to thank all the school, college and exam centre staff who will have worked so hard to put on the autumn exam series in the interest of their students during this challenging time."
