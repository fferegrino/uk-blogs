While central to the development of our transactional services, the pace at which we had to work meant we were primarily focused on usability. We wanted to redress this balance and be more strategic with our practice. User-centred design is now on an equal footing to other DDaT professions in our strategy. Our mission is to \u201cexplore and champion the needs of our users, helping DIT design services that maximise successful international trade and the delivery of its outcomes. We will partner with the business and collaborate with other business-facing departments to achieve this goal.\u201d"

This means that in everything we do we will strive to \u201cdevelop a robust understanding of the user, using simple solutions wherever possible and putting service design at the heart of our delivery approach; as well as collect data once, maximising utility to minimise the collection burden. We see this as essential to producing products and services that deliver the intended outcomes and maximise value for money for DIT.\u201d"

It's especially important we take a step back as the trade landscape is complex, relying on multiple government departments, private, and third sector organisations, and has changed significantly in recent years. We\u2019re evolving how we organise ourselves so user-centred design leads can look after a set of user needs, across multiple services. They do this as part of a portfolio team that aligns to the department\u2019s outcomes and gives them access to the strategy, policy, and operational teams responsible for those."

However, with strategic user-centred design and the right data and technology infrastructure, we can give users what feels like a single front door. To get there we will clarify our strategy for serving businesses across both GOV.UK (hosting regulatory services) and great.gov.uk (hosting educational and promotional services) and knit together more of DIT\u2019s new online services. We will also help our DIT colleagues clarify our channel strategy and figure out any adjustment we need to make to our service offering. Many of our services have fundamentally been the same for decades. DIT now has the opportunity to adapt them to the needs of businesses today so we can maximise our impact on the UK economy. \u00a0As user-centred designers, we have a responsibility to help get this right, and we will be tapping into the government policy design community to help us collaborate effectively with policy colleagues."

The recent revamp of our online offer for businesses learning to export is one example: powered by a state-of-the-art data infrastructure, we\u2019ve developed the capability to personalise content for our users. We want to continue to build on this, and go further still. As a global promotional department at our core, information is a key asset. We create, change, and share it at immense pace and at scale: our network operates in 177 locations across the world. There are new capabilities available on the market that can help us do this more effectively and efficiently."
