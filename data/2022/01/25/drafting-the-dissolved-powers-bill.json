While we stayed at home to stay safe, businesses struggled to stay afloat while restrictions were in place. As a result, Government put forward the Bounce Back Loan scheme and other pandemic support measures to shore up businesses until restrictions were lifted and the economy could begin to recover."

One such measure, on which we had consulted in 2018, was the ability to investigate the conduct of former directors of dissolved companies."
