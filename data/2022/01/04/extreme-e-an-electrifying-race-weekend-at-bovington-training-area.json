Some of the biggest names in motorsport are involved: teams owned by Sir Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are represented, as well as former Formula One World Champion Jenson Button MBE, who both owns and drives with his JBXE team."

This needed reducing in height by about two metres, with an extension to the landing area so that the Extreme E vehicles would be able to perform impressive jumps without being destroyed!"

This was carried out by a local contractor, Andrews, with assistance from the Royal Engineers as part of a training exercise. The work will leave a legacy of improved training facilities for future military users of BTA, including significant track repairs and a location for additional bridging and low loader training."

A wide range of support was provided, from advice over routes to meetings with the Ministry of Defence Police, local police, Dorset Highways and Armour Centre staff to ensure that preparations for the race weekend didn\u2019t impact on military training."

It\u2019s home to a variety of rare wildlife including the woodlark, Dartford warbler, smooth snake, and sand lizard \u2013 which thrive in the areas of loose sand dug up by heavy-tracked vehicles."

The cars were transported to Dorset by boat, and to reduce the environmental footprint of the event there were no spectators; instead, the race weekend could be streamed or watched live on TV. What\u2019s more, as part of its Legacy programme, Extreme E is actively supporting an ongoing National Trust project to reintroduce beavers to nearby Studland."
