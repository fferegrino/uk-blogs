This advice is based on the latest data on how long people remain infectious, and modelling of different self-isolation options."

            "text": "After 10 days self-isolation, 5% of people will still be infectious. Ending self-isolation after 7 days and two negative LFD tests results in a similar level of protection. The two negative test results are critical to safely supporting the end of self-isolation: if self-isolation ended on day 7 without testing, modelling suggests that 16% of people would still be infectious."

            "text": "In the UK our advice is to self-isolate for at least 6 full days from the point at which you have symptoms or get a positive test, whichever is first. If you have two negative LFD test results on days 6 and 7, you can leave self-isolation on day 7."

            "text": "Our modelling suggests that 10-30% of people will potentially still remain infectious on day 6, if no re-assurance tests are performed at this point. The CDC also recognises that this length of isolation may not be sufficient on its own, and they advise, amongst other measures, the wearing of face masks as a mitigation for a further 5 days after this initial isolation period. They also recommend that anyone with symptoms should self-isolate for 10 full days unless those symptoms are improving by the end of day 5. They have also recently (4 January) updated their advice to recommend people take a test where possible before leaving isolation after 5 days."

        {
            "text": "Therefore, our current assessment is that shortening the isolation period further beyond the current 6 full days (including end of isolation assurance testing) would increase the risk of releasing individuals who could still be infectious. In some settings, where people in work in very close proximity, it may worsen staff shortages if it led to more people being infected"

            "text": "We will of course keep this position under review as evidence accumulates and as the government monitors workforce impacts of the isolation policy in critical sectors. In particular, our assessment may change as we continue to learn more about the features of the Omicron variant compared to, for example, the Delta variant."

        {
            "text": "We believe that allowing people to leave self-isolation after two negative lateral flow tests on days 6 and 7 is the optimal approach at present. This supports people who are unlikely to be infectious to go back to work and resume other activities, but continues to protect the wider population from infection."
