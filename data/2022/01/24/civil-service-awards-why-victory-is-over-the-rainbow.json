As the person behind the programme, John scooped the accolade on behalf of the LGBT+ mentoring scheme, one of the largest of its kind across the Civil Service. What makes it even more remarkable is that John set the programme up in his spare time, working from his living room over evenings and weekends."

Another aim was to create greater visibility of LGBT+ role models throughout the Civil Service. Research into the career progression of LGBT+ civil servants found that respondents felt they lacked access to the same career and development opportunities as their straight or cisgendered colleagues. Mentoring was one development opportunity that was cited and has been consistently asked for.\u00a0"

Knowing that not only has it worked, but that it\u2019s seen as a standard bearer is brilliant. Our calculated gamble paid off.\u201d"

So what I\u2019m proud of is that this programme demonstrates that the Civil Service is dedicated to putting other people first. It\u2019s the little acts of selflessness that keep opportunities like this alive. I hope the award will inspire more people to get involved next time. That will be reward enough.\u201d"

Everything we do, whatever our roles are, touches people\u2019s lives. The best thing about public service for me is getting to see the impact of your work in the real world.\u201d"
