            "text": "However, I\u2019ve been working with the Dumfries and Galloway Pine Marten Group on an initiative to encourage a permanent population of pine martens. Research has shown that where pine martens have been reintroduced or encouraged, red squirrels flourish. This is because pine martens are a natural predator of squirrels, but red squirrels are much more cautious of pine martens than their grey cousins."

            "text": "There is evidence of existing pine marten activity in the area, but it is mostly migratory. To help change that, we\u2019ve obtained funding from DIO\u2019s Conservation Group to install six pine marten den boxes. These replicate large tree cavities, which are not that common in nature, and form a safe area where pine martens can breed and spend the winter. I\u2019m hopeful the boxes will help a small, permanent pine marten population to develop and reduce our grey squirrel numbers, encouraging a resurgence of their red cousins."

Working with our industry partner Landmarc Support Services, we\u2019ve removed non-native plant species such as rhododendron, montbretia and bamboo and replaced them with Scottish wildflowers. The hope and intention is that this will increase insect numbers and diversity of insect species."

[Crown Copyright, MOD 2021]We\u2019ve also removed scrub to allow more light to reach the forest floor and have improved the path around the lake and added a small picnic area to encourage responsible public access. Canadian pond weed has been removed from the lake and a new sluice gate installed to allow the water level to be raised to its natural depth, which has increased water quality and flow dramatically. I\u2019m also planning to reintroduce native fish species, primarily brown trout."
