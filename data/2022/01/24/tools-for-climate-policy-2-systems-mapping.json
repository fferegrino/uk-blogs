The first blog described a co-design process at the Design for Planet festival which coincided with COP26. This blog focuses on systems mapping as featured in a collaboration between Policy Lab, UCL and stakeholders in the UK\u2019s industry and building sectors (see image above). The project considered options for how to achieve the UK\u2019s net zero target. The blog will describe what system maps are and share five key ways to apply them in policymaking, using the net zero project as a reference. We'll then signpost you to other useful resources to help you get started in your own work."

This particular map was made using a collaborative online tool called Kumu, but there are infinite ways a system could be visualised - we've also experimented with whiteboards, post its and string. But importantly putting something down on 'paper' - making it visual - provides a starting point for surfacing and understanding different perspectives."

It shows how better build quality (marked \u20181\u2019 on the image) will drive improvements in the performance of building \u2018fabric\u2019, i.e. the materials and components that a building is made of, such as walls, floors and windows (2). In turn, this reduces the demand for heating (3) and thus reduces energy use by buildings (4). These four factors together achieve the primary intended outcome relating to decarbonising buildings. However, in the system map we can also see that improvement in building fabric affects three other important policy outcomes which are not directly related to carbon emissions: air quality in buildings (5), summer overheating (6) and mortality from cold homes (7)."

            "text": "Where such unintended consequences are positive, we may be tempted to think there is no problem. However if such spillover benefits are under-recognised because they do not achieve the immediate policy objectives, then they may be unaccounted for in the assessment of a policy, for example through a cost-benefit analysis. This may mean a given policy is not adopted when it could have had significant positive outcomes for society."

Such effects can undermine policies in other areas of government, causing a waste of resources and problems for people, organisations and delivery bodies alike. The identification and visualisation of such indirect impacts is the first step in enabling policymakers across the system to take appropriate coordinated action through various policy levers."

Because these relationships are all positively related, they can lead to runaway benefits - or runaway failure. Interventions are likely to fail if they ignore reinforcing dynamics, which is one way of understanding persistent structural or root causes of policy problems. Isolated interventions in one part of a reinforcing loop are likely to have disproportionately high impacts. This is because the initial intervention and its impact are multiplied as this mini system drives itself."
