In the face of\u00a0additional\u00a0responsibilities and uncertainty brought by the pandemic, you continue to respond with professionalism and care to\u00a0provide\u00a0high quality education, care and pastoral support for children and young people."

I want to reassure you and your staff that enabling face-to-face education and childcare is my absolute priority.\u00a0You\u00a0have already done\u00a0an\u00a0outstanding\u00a0job in implementing\u00a0measures that have\u00a0helped to keep children and young people in\u00a0face-to-face\u00a0environments\u00a0and you have my continued support in keeping your settings open."

This will be a temporary measure from the start of January. Ofsted has already confirmed that it will not be inspecting secondary schools during the first week of term in January, as schools undertake on-site pupil testing. Ofsted will also encourage early years settings, schools and colleges that are significantly impacted by COVID-related staff absence to ask for their inspection to be deferred."

All secondary school students should undertake one on-site test on return to boost testing participation and help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the holidays. In addition, FE and HE students, and staff are asked to self-test at home before they return. All staff and students are also strongly encouraged to test twice a week using an LFD test and to report all results to the NHS\u00a0and to their setting."

You can support this effort by using your own professional and personal networks to encourage others\u00a0to sign up\u00a0to offer temporary help."

Flexible delivery involves utilising\u00a0all\u00a0your available\u00a0teaching and non-teaching\u00a0workforce to maximise on-site education\u00a0for as many pupils as possible\u00a0while you flexibly deliver provision either on-site or\u00a0remotely to some pupils."

We have worked with leaders across the sector to\u00a0share\u00a0case studies\u00a0that\u00a0may help\u00a0you to develop and adopt flexible learning approaches in your own setting and you can continue to access free bespoke support from the EdTech Demonstrator network."
