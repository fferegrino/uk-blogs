            "text": "Good ventilation prevents the virus hanging in the air and infecting people. Many areas of schools are already well-ventilated with plenty of air movement but we want to help schools identify where ventilation can be improved. We took action in the autumn term by providing carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors to all state-funded education settings, including early years, schools and further education providers, backed by \u00a325million in government funding. Across the the education estate we\u2019ve delivered over 353,000 monitors. The new monitors enable staff to identify areas where ventilation needs to be improved and provide reassurance that existing ventilation measures are working, helping balance the need for good ventilation with keeping classrooms warm."

        {
            "text": "People exhale CO2 when they breathe. In areas where people congregate it can build up in the air if the spaces aren\u2019t well ventilated. In this sort of situation the C02 itself isn\u2019t harmful but using monitors to detect it helps identify areas where ventilation isn\u2019t good. These are the same areas where if the virus is present it could hang around and infect people. If schools and other education settings know where these areas exist they can take action to ventilate them."

        {
            "text": "The first steps are simple ones like opening doors and windows. Schools should first take these steps and see how it affects the CO2 reading in that area. The feedback we\u2018ve had from schools suggests they are finding the monitors helpful and that in the majority of cases existing ventilation measures are sufficient."

        {
            "text": "No, in most cases that won\u2019t be necessary. Opening windows regularly for 10 minutes, or a small amount continuously, can still reduce the airborne risk from COVID-19 substantially compared to spaces with no fresh air. The monitors will enable staff to know when the ventilation measures are working, helping to balance the need for good ventilation with keeping classrooms warm."

        {
            "text": "Where it is not possible to maintain adequate ventilation, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit while the underlying issue is addressed. When used properly, air cleaning units can help reduce the presence of viruses like COVID-19 in a poorly ventilated space. It is however important to note that air cleaning units are not a substitute for ventilation and they are not necessary in the majority of spaces where ventilation is already adequate. Air cleaning devices will not reduce CO2 levels."

            "text": "That\u2019s why, based on the feedback we had from settings following the CO2 monitor programme, for the very few cases where maintaining good ventilation is not possible, we are supplying up to a total of 8000 air cleaning units."
