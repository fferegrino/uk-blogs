I studied my A-Levels and then did a degree in Psychology before moving into social work. I think my own history had a role to play in my decision to be a social worker. My brother and I are both adopted. When his adoption broke down when he was 14 years old, he ended up going into care which sadly was not a good experience."

I've always been a person that\u2019s interested in supporting others and understanding where they\u2019re coming from. Before I came into child and family social work, I spent time in adult care as a carer for the elderly and ran a Saturday club for disabled children."

We know from research that many of the workforce come with their own histories of trauma. This brings with it lots of opportunities and understanding. However, working with families can also be triggering; practitioners can experience secondary trauma through the work itself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we recognise, understand and have support in place for all of our staff."

This is a big project, it will be a long journey but it\u2019s very exciting."
