Of these, 94.7% of beaches and inland waters gained an \u2018Excellent\u2019 or \u2018Good\u2019 rating while 4.3% achieved the minimum \u2018Sufficient\u2019 rating. This compares with 98.3% passing the required standards in 2019, and is the highest number since new standards were introduced in 2015."
