We work with DIO to manage land and facilities across the MOD\u2019s 190,000 hectares of UK training estate, and my job has a focus on long term forestry management, biosecurity and plant health across the range of woodlands this encompasses."

The north east was worst affected, with gales of up to 100mph causing widespread damage and the most severe disruption to power supplies since 2005. Sadly, large areas of woodlands on the DTE were badly hit, with Otternburn Training Area in Northumberland suffering from around 20,000 windblown trees.\u00a0\u00a0"

The damage was spread across all the training area\u2019s ranges, some of which had to be made out of bounds to protect the health and safety of users. Thankfully, though, Landmarc and DIO teams were able to ensure that other areas remained safe and open for military training.\u00a0"

This work will continue over the course of the year to ensure that all remaining areas of windblown trees are safely cleared while military training continues. Once cleared, we should be able to recover a large percentage of the fallen timber to dispatch to local sawmills for processing.\u00a0\u00a0"

This will allow us to make them more resilient, not only to climate change but also pests and diseases, which are a real threat at present. In addition, we\u2019ll be able to adapt and re-design the woodland layouts to make them more flexible to military training needs.\u00a0"

Pests and diseases will always represent a threat, increased by warmer temperatures brought about by climate change, but by planting a mix of species we\u2019ll reduce the risk of losing whole planted areas.\u00a0"
