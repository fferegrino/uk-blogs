Our ability to conduct cutting edge research and pull through innovative technologies and methods is fundamental to our mission. GCHQ has a rich and proud history of world class STRI which has underpinned our mission capability. Technology and target advancement are making this ever more critical, and it is vitally important that we keep up with - and ahead of - the outside world. We are working with a growing range of partners outside GCHQ in a range of different ways to increase the pace and impact of our research."
