If you choose to register it with us, you could have the monopoly over that name, within your chosen categories of goods or services. We call these classifications."

For apps like \u2018Delivr Me\u2019, if there is originality within the functionality of the application, it could be patentable. This can all get very technical and so seeking the advice of an IP attorney is always a good idea if you\u2019re thinking to apply for patent protection."
