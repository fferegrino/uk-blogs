They claimed to use data and science to come to this conclusion but all they were really doing was encouraging you to book a holiday."

I had come off my medication, I was struggling with another lockdown and was in a job that I had long since fallen out of love with. Luckily I have been very open with my mental health since my first major scare with depression and I reached out to my friends and my wife. There were numerous socially distanced cups of coffee, walks in the woods and park visits (and visits to my GP, don\u2019t forget that part) that helped guide me out of it last year and cleared the fog. Sometimes being honest and saying it out loud is the first step."
