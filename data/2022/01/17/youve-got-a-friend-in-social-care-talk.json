Sometimes, information comes from chance encounters, when you\u2019re walking the dog or dropping off the kids.

I\u2019m thinking particularly about older people who are self-funders, and their grown up children who often play an essential role in arranging care. They are faced with a triple whammy of figuring out what care the older person needs, how to arrange it and how to pay for it."

We recorded 29 interviews with self-funders and family carers in a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research, called \u2018Finding and funding social care\u2019. We grouped video and audio clips from the interviews into major issues and placed them on the site."
