I think January is a really important time to reflect as our minds turn to the year ahead. Last year was really challenging for many but it is important to take time to recognise\u00a0 what was achieved."

In addition, the Agency worked closely with Defra to develop and implement schemes and services which saw the launch of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) pilot with over 2,500 expressions of interest and over 900 applicants."

RPA helped farmers, in delivering environmental outcomes, through the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CS) and Environmental Stewardship Scheme (ES). Just under 101,300 eligible 2021 claims received in the region of \u00a31.8bn (92%) by the end of December (2020: 98,400; \u00a389.5%). This represented 98.3% of BPS, 62.2% of CS revenue and 64.6% of ES eligible claims. In addition, just under 5,700 CS Capital claims received \u00a366.75m within an average of 30 working days which helped the establishment and maintenance of woodland and hedges."

In December the RPA launched the initial Farming Investment Fund, including the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund and the Water Management theme of the Farming Transformation Fund. Farmers will benefit from a \u00a327 million pot to invest in productivity-boosting equipment."

Working closely with farmers and land managers, changes were made to the scheme this year to expand the options available and make it easier to apply for."

The Agency saw an improved interest for the new Capital Grants scheme for 2021 with over 3,000 applications received to improve air quality, water quality, boundary trees and orchards or a mixture of these options. While many agreement offers were issued before the end of 2021, the RPA were still working on applications with a view to issuing offers on the remainder early in 2022."

The \u00a32.5 million fund encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing amongst the farming community to protect and enhance their local environment, in line with their local Countryside Stewardship priorities. The fund includes support for new environmental priorities such as the improvement of air quality through slurry removal, reduction of ammonia emissions, tree planting and shelters, and managing beaver activity that will offer support and advice for landowners when beavers move onto their land."

This package included measures to increase the throughput of pigs through processors. We opened up both the Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme (SIPS) aiming to increase the throughput of pigs by contributing towards the extra costs involved in operating additional slaughter shifts at abattoirs and a Private Storage Aid (PSA) scheme to contribute towards the costs of cold storage of the product."

Where breaches occurred, the Agency utilised a wider range of options, including early warnings and opportunities for farmers to put things right instead of moving straight to reductions. We continue to learn lessons from this approach."

The RPA attended shows and events across the country providing regular progress updates and heard first-hand about farmers' experiences which has helped improve future services. We also hosted several regional roundtables with English Members of Parliament and their constituents. Across 2022 we will continue to engage with farmers, land managers and representative organisations."

A refreshed focus on improved learning and development; enhancement of leadership and change capabilities; strengthening diversity and inclusion; evolving the internal ways of working; and improving the overall quality of the internal engagement. I was very proud that the RPA was named as best practice leaders, alongside other leading UK organisations, in values-based leadership by the Institute of Leading and Management (ILM) and City and Guilds."
