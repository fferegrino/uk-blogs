We have an early draft of the API specification and we\u2019re getting to the bulk upload next, but we needed to prioritise the user needs of less digitally mature organisations to ensure we\u2019re delivering a data submission service that everyone can use."

To help users do their jobs quicker and better, we\u2019ve been experimenting with GOV.UK\u2019s Task List pattern and the one-thing-per-page design principle, to replace the long online \u201cform\u201d with all the questions on one page."

        {
            "text": "This was risky because it\u2019s a long form, there are around 30 questions for the user to complete, so splitting the questions into one-thing-per-page could increase the time it takes to submit the data. Also, with the previous design, users liked scanning the questions quickly and knowing what questions are coming. However, user testing of the new design has found that users feel more confident in using the service and in the data they\u2019re submitting."

But our priority right now is to deliver a service that\u2019s more usable and accessible for all, on all devices, and can be improved more easily to meet data providers\u2019 and DLUHC analyst\u2019s\u2019 evolving needs."

Existing users told us they\u2019d still call the service and the activity \u201cCORE\u201d, but we know new users don\u2019t understand the acronym. Also, good service names are verbs, not nouns. So we\u2019ve named the new service \u201cSubmit social housing lettings and sales data (CORE)\u201d. This is according to what users expect to do, and for now, \u2018CORE\u2019 is staying in brackets!"

            "text": "From a tech perspective, we\u2019ve moved from document / paper-form based data collections to being (JSON) schema-led. This means the online log submission user interface is now auto-generated. Other formats, such as a printable form, a bulk upload template and the API spec could be auto-generated in future, rather than manually built from a legacy paper form. The aspiration is for a much more efficient and flexible way to build and maintain a data collection service."
