It's the only 100% prisoner-facing service in MOJ Digital and Technology. In developing it, we've been constantly awake to the needs of these users and their highly-specific accessibility requirements."

            "text": "Communication in the prison estate is extremely important, as mentioned in our last blog. It can mean the difference between a calm landing and 'association' session, and a fight breaking out. If prisoners can't get the information they need, or can't get to use the kiosks to send apps or check their personal information, this leads to frustration, anger, sometimes aggression and even violence.\u00a0"

            "text": "Why? It's widely accepted that many people in prison have limited literacy skills, on top of concentration and neurodiversity issues, alongside their own individual long-term trauma, addiction and mental health problems. Our research has shown that 100% written communication and verbal instruction can easily go unread or unheard due to a cocktail of some, or all, of these factors. How then, do prisoners learn the rules, processes and what goes on in the place in which they live?"

Easy to say in hindsight.\u00a0"

Staff might get exhausted with prisoners constantly asking the same things. prisoners might pass on incorrect information, genuinely and on purpose. A combination of many opposing 'truths' can leave a newcomer, already in crisis, reeling. "

Similarly with audio, we found the boys were happy to listen to information, so long as it was in a voice they trusted (what we now call 'the authentic voice') and information was in simple language with no jargon or acronyms.\u00a0"

However well induction information is given, it can still not be 'heard'. And then we found some boys don't even make eye contact with another boy for weeks, never mind dare to ask them what time lunch might be."
