When we were appointed to the CSW role, we were keen to produce a practical guide, not only offering links to other publications, but also revisiting the principles of the Care Act and supporting consistency of application across local authorities."

            "text": "Most of all, we saw wide variations of practice across the country, both through the data and, anecdotally, through people\u2019s stories. If we are to truly get adult safeguarding right, it is vital local authorities and social workers apply safeguarding practice, as set out in the Care Act and its associated statutory guidance."
