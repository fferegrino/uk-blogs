And with some nervously squeezed-shut eyes and pre-jab anticipation, more than 130 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been provided to the public across the UK. Made possible, of course, by incredible civil and public servants right across all corners of the public sector, working on The Vaccines Programme - succinctly named - which won this year\u2019s Programme of the Year Award."

The programme has saved hundreds of thousands of lives and prevented millions of infections. Uptake has exceeded all previous vaccination programmes and the pace and operational excellence of the programme has been globally recognised."

Working on a mission of such critical national importance during the pandemic helped us deal with the pressures and challenges along the way.\u201d"

We are so proud of everything the programme has achieved, and to see that on TV so regularly has really helped to get information and advice to people.\u201d"
