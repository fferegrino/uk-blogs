We recently spoke to Alex whose team won the Outstanding Team award at the Tackling Economic Crime Awards (TECAs).

            "text": "I currently lead a team of frontline criminal investigators and it may sound clich\u00e9, but due to the type of work we do, each day is different. Our job is to gather evidence and bring forward cases to prosecute those who commit criminal offences against HMRC. This can be through a variety of methods, such as, surveillance deployments, obtaining witness statements, arresting and interviewing suspects, and searching premises."
