As we\u2019ve all had to find clever solutions to work efficiently and collaboratively due to the pandemic and contact restrictions, HMPO\u2019s Digital Application Processing (DAP) service has enabled an uninterrupted passport service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and deservedly wins this year\u2019s Best Use of Data and Technology Award."

It is easier to navigate, and it takes you through the passport examination process in a far more structured and simplified fashion. DAP has been far easier to learn and the speed of processing is such that you are able to handle far more applications than its predecessor. DAP is being continuously iterated on. This has enabled staff to contribute towards its development, and any problems you encounter, you are able to work on the solution. It\u2019s really important to be part of the solution.\u201d - Sandra Hayes, Passport Examiner"
