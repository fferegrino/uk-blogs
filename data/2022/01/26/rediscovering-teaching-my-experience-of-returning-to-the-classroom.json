We\u2019re inviting qualified ex-teachers to step in and help teach children and young people in school and college on a temporary basis and in this blog Loic describes his experience so far.

            "text": "Initially, my desire to stay connected to the classroom meant I continued going back to my former school. I did some supply teaching and helped out with revision classes, but over time, my work running the \u2018think and action-tank\u2019 at The Centre for Education and Youth (CfEY) stretched the umbilical-cord further and further. It was never really severed though, which is why when I heard about how hard teachers were working to cope with pandemic-induced staff shortages, I decided to put my tie back on and pick up my board-pen."

I\u2019d always been good at building rapport with students, but ten years back there was no Instagram and certainly no TikTok; would I know how to connect with pupils born in the 21st Century? And would I still be able to project any sort of authority?"

            "text": "I know that tight staffing can mean teachers end up being scrambled into extra-lunch duties and at the moment, some schools are having to combine multiple classes in an effort to keep schools open. I realised I\u2019d only be making a small contribution, but I hoped I could at least lighten the burden a little."

            "text": "One of the main things I\u2019ve been doing in my first two days back has been helping out with the one-to-one and small group support that has had to be cut-back while schools keep their heads above water. For example, as a native French speaker, I\u2019ve been able to do some speaking practice with small groups who, pre-pandemic, would have had regular time with a French assistant. I\u2019ve also had conversations with pupils wanting to talk through their future A-level and university options. Now that I\u2019ve revived the Mr Menzies alter-ego I\u2019m hoping that next week I\u2019ll feel comfortable taking on a bit more responsibility with a full class."

            "text": "Even though I\u2019m only able to help-out one day a week, I\u2019ve loved meeting brilliant students and deeply committed staff. Today, for example, I met a Year 12 who loves photography so much that he\u2019s set up his own business capturing people\u2019s portraits and recording events. It was great to be able to give him some impromptu advice on registering as self-employed and developing his business."

            "text": "An added bit of interest for me has come from working somewhere completely different to the school I used to teach in. Back in the early 2000s I worked in an extremely diverse central London school, squeezed onto a tiny site. In contrast, the school I\u2019ve returned to is more rural and stretched over a vast and sprawling site. Of course, every context has its own challenges, but I\u2019ve really enjoyed looking out of the window and seeing soaring red kites instead of swarming pigeons."

            "text": "It\u2019s still early days but it\u2019s been a great experience so far and it\u2019s wonderful (and a relief) to hear that the school have found it useful. I\u2019d certainly recommend it to any other former teachers who might not be ready to step away completely."
