We\u2019re looking for accomplished professionals with enthusiasm, relevant skills and a commitment to public service to do an intellectually stimulating and challenging job, working for a highly regarded organisation. If that sounds appealing, check out a week in the life of an inspector below."

We have inspectors working from home in urban and rural areas, from Cornwall to Norfolk and from Hampshire to Northumberland. Some work full-time, some part-week and some part-year."

If you have children, you may enjoy the school run or attending daytime events such as sports days or assemblies. If your partner is at home during the day, you may enjoy being able to spend more time with them. So long as you deliver your work to the required quality and timeliness standards, when and how you work is largely up to you. But you will always have the support and assistance of colleagues when you need it."

If you were conducting a public hearing your week would, instead, be taken up with preparing for and holding the event, followed by writing up your decision."

Sometimes you will meet the appellant, their representative and/or someone from the local planning authority. Make sure you see everything you need to \u2013 and take careful notes of what you see!"
