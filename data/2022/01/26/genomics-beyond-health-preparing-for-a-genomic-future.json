There is already evidence that specific behavioural traits, such as risk-taking and substance abuse, are influenced by the genome. One day, genomic science will reach a point where it might be possible to predict these non-health traits too."

However, the ability to do these things doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we should: we will need to think carefully about the potential opportunities and risks posed by using genomics in this way."

Genomics presents risks and opportunities to a wide range of sectors, one of which may be yours. These include practical considerations, ethical dilemmas, and questions around equality and discrimination. The genomic revolution is already happening \u2013 the question is, will we be ready for it?"

It considers what new possibilities might emerge in the future and what all this might mean for policy in areas including education, insurance, criminal justice, and employment. We will be working with policy officials across departments to support them in considering how genomics might impact their departments\u2019 areas of policy and explore what action might be necessary to prepare for the opportunities and risks that the application of this fast-developing science will bring with it."
