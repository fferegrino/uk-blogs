Cyient, Landmark and our teams will all work to the same data quality standards and delivery outcomes. All teams have a licence to innovate and improve how these outcomes are achieved. We have incentivised punctual delivery and quality standards through a work allocation model, based on \u201cthe better you do the more work you can have\u201d."
