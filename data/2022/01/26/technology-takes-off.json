If the pandemic has taught us any positive lessons, it\u2019s that technology must be at the heart of future approaches to care. Digital platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp have become a lifeline for many, enabling people who draw on care to connect easily with their care workers, friends and family."

To a large degree, this comes from the realisation that current models of care are not sustainable, with the workforce needing to stretch and grow beyond traditional approaches. Some estimates suggest an additional 600,000 care staff may be needed in the next two years alone."

We found that, whilst there was a growing recognition of the importance of technology, people often lacked the training, skills and tools needed to take advantage. More significantly, there were concerns technology could undermine relationship-based ways of working, including strengths-based practice."

            "text": "The second intervention is about reframing arguments around the impact of digital technology on frontline practice. Technology, used well, can augment and enhance human conversations, create more resources and assets, and make sure people\u2019s information is shared properly to avoid them having to repeat their story many times."

For the government to realise its vision and the sector to unlock new models of care, we need to look at technology in the round. It\u2019s not a project or pilot. It\u2019s not just about data or assistive technology. It is a whole way of thinking, working and supporting people. So, let\u2019s think big!"
