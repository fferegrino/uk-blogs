Ideas were submitted, ranging from, addressing issues facing the user in the maritime sector and ideas that sought improvements, to internal processes. Cross-functional teams were formed around three successful ideas and volunteers from departments across the organisation, including: operations, technology, defence, customer and government. Our Research, Design & Innovation team facilitated the week from initial concept or hypothesis to functional prototype."
