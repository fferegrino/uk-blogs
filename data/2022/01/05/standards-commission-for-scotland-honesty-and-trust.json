            "text": "The Standards Commission for Scotland is an independent public body, responsible for encouraging high standards of behaviour by local government councillors and those appointed to the boards of devolved public bodies. Its role is to strengthen ethical standards in public life; including promoting the Codes of Conduct and issuing guidance to councils and devolved public bodies; and to adjudicate on alleged breaches of the Codes of Conduct, and where a breach is found, to apply a sanction."

            "text": "It\u2019s fair to say there has been a great deal of press coverage recently about the honesty of our leaders.\u00a0 The conduct of politicians and others in public life is under intense scrutiny, with many questions asked of their integrity."

            "text": "Of course, putting a \u201cspin\u201d on matters is seen as part and parcel of politics. There is, however, a difference between highlighting issues or facts to suit your argument (or omitting to talk about ones that don\u2019t) and deliberately and knowingly misleading the public."

            "text": "The answer relates to trust. A lack of trust in those in public life does not just affect the reputation of any one individual; it can also erode confidence in public messaging, public bodies and the delivery of public services. Guarding against such an erosion of confidence is especially important during a pandemic or in other times of crisis."

            "text": "Recent polling paints a stark picture \u2013 63% of the public believe that politicians are mainly in politics for themselves [1]. The polls show a steady decline in public trust over the last 77 years \u2013 the question was first posed in 1944 \u2013 with only 5% of those polled believing our elected officials are in it for the country\u2019s best interests."

            "text": "A loss of trust and confidence in elected officials, and consequently in their messaging, can lead to the spread of misinformation with some people even turning to conspiracy theories. In turn, that can lead to those trying to debunk such theories and ensure prominence of the facts often having to face abuse and mistrust.\u00a0 As has been noted in the press, mistrust can also affect adherence to the guidelines and rules. If members of the public don\u2019t trust the reasons given for such rules, they are less likely to follow them."

        {
            "text": "So not only is it important that politicians and others in public life are honest, but also that they demonstrate another Nolan principle - that of leadership. The leadership principle asks that holders of public office should exhibit all of the key principles in their own behaviour, and take an active part in promoting them and in challenging poor behaviour where it occurs."
