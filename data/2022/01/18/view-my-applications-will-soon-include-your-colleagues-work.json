This enhancement to the HM Land Registry portal has enabled customers to manage applications and correspondence in one central place. Since then it has had more than 127,000 users, with more than 3.5 million page views, and we continue to gather feedback from customers to inform further development. Many customers have stated they would like to be able to see their colleagues\u2019 work as well as their own submissions."

            "text": "We can now share our plans to launch this new feature to all users in early spring. You will be able to search all applications submitted by colleagues within your business unit. Each business unit has at least one dedicated administrator within your company. Ask your team if you need clarity on the scope of your business unit."

            "text": "We understand it will be useful for some of you to see the full list of applications that a colleague is working on. So, we are now developing the option to return all applications being managed by specific colleagues. This means you will be able to review the progress of, or continue working on, your colleagues\u2019 applications when they are away from the office. More news will be shared about this function in the near future."

As a result, we have introduced an \u2018opt-out\u2019 feature which can be used at any point. The nominated 'Responsible Person\u2019 for each business unit can manage this from within their account settings. \u00a0More details on the \u2018opt-out\u2019 feature have been sent to all Responsible Persons, Deputy Responsible Persons and Business Unit Administrators."

The Respond feature allows you to reply to a requisition or other HM Land Registry correspondence, add documents and notes to the application, or request an extension of time in reply to our correspondence, directly from View My Applications."

            "text": "The Export feature allows you to extract information relating to all or a selected sample of applications based on the search and filter options you have used. And the Correspondence section was expanded to included 3 new categories, Review, Resolve and Information, that help give a quick view on which elements of an application still need to be resolved. These enhancements are all designed to work together to optimise the portal further."

Due to upfront error checking, we\u2019ve also been able to cut processing time in half."

We are also incorporating automation wherever practical, reducing the administrative burden on our expert caseworkers so they can focus on the details of a case. With a greater adoption of electronic signatures and digital identity checks, along with the improvements we are making to the portal and our Business Gateway experience, we anticipate real efficiency gains for all involved in the conveyancing process."
