This received coverage in the Express, Sun, Daily Mail and on ITV News."

Many of these unexploded bombs lie in areas which are heavily used by marine industries, including offshore wind, and the bombs must be removed to allow safe working conditions."

The trials will seek to characterise, for the first time, the resulting noise and chemical contaminant releases in the marine environment; and to determine whether the technology is safe and effective on historic ordnance that have been left in the marine environment for many years."
