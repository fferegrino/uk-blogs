We aim to make sure that anyone using alt text through assistive technologies can get the same information from the description of an image as someone who relies on the visuals. Alt text often assists visually impaired people but is also used for search engine optimisation and for making sense of an image if it isn't visible or doesn't load."

This includes elements such as borders, line breaks and brand graphics. Keeping alt text concise is a skill, and honing in on that skill to make the most of your alt text will ensure that many accessibility needs are met."
