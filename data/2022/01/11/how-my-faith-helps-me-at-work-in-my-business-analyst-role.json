Even earlier than that as a Philosophy student at university I was bewildered by those with faith.\u00a0\u00a0"

He articulated what it was like to be a Christian and how he found and maintained his own faith. He openly and intelligently answered any questions I had. He then challenged me to take a first step of faith.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "I began to read about The Desert Fathers and re-read the philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard. I found a sudden hunger to read more and was introduced to a whole pantheon of Christian writers I had never heard of before. During this time, I was actively supported by others to understand and question what I was reading, while finding myself increasingly attending church. Christmas and especially Easter took on a whole new meaning.\u00a0"

            "text": "Gradually over time I fell deeply in love with Christianity. I remember the exact moment I knew I had found faith for the first time. That love and joy has not left me once since and continues to grow. Faith doesn\u2019t always make sense and prayer doesn\u2019t always come easily but nothing I ever have loved makes sense in pure logical terms. Without that vicar and those who supported me I would not have the gift of faith. Chance plays its part and there is a real power to be found in communities.\u00a0\u00a0"

I also love to solve problems. Faith calls you to use your talents in service and support of others. It\u2019s a probable reason I became a Business Analyst and very likely why I take every opportunity to mentor or play a lead role in the Business Analyst community, for example, supporting the Learning and Development of other Business Analysts.\u00a0\u00a0"

My daily prayer life affects everything I do, in every second of every day, taking the opportunity to reflect and adjust myself and my actions constantly. This all supports working hard with my team for the best outcomes, made using the best decisions, using the best analysis. Faith has a tangible power to transform, to re-frame and constantly heal and I try to bring this with me to my work each and every day.\u00a0"

The pandemic which started almost 2 years ago admittedly led to feelings of isolation, from friends, family and my faith community, which have had quite a profound effect on me. It feels in many ways like a grief for the loss of the life we had before. I found most of my strength on days of lockdown, trying to work while home-schooling my children and caring for my family and wider community, through my faith.\u00a0"
