The Rose Book is an updated version of the \u2018Draft guidance on knowledge assets in government\u2019 that was published in April 2021."

            "text": "Frequent readers of our blog will be aware that knowledge assets are intangible assets such as research and development, Intellectual Property (IP), data sets and knowhow, and they are fast becoming the bedrock on which all successful modern business across the world are based. When successfully exploited, these assets can bring significant social, economic and financial benefits, making them fundamental to the effective delivery of government objectives."

            "text": "The government\u2019s Knowledge Assets Programme is important for any public sector organisation holding intangible assets (including less obvious things like ideas, designs or other materials) that were developed inhouse. It will also be a contributing factor in helping to unleash a new wave of public sector innovation and cementing the UK\u2019s reputation as a \u201cscience superpower\u201d."

This helped make the document easier to understand, more user-friendly, and useful for those across the public sector when implementing the knowledge assets work."

            "text": "To support public sector organisations with embedding the knowledge assets work and thinking about the best way to strategically manage them, a new chapter was created \u2013 a Quick Start Guide. This chapter provides additional useful tools for users such as a to do list, a worked example of how to initiate the work, an example knowledge asset management strategy, an example knowledge asset register, and a \u2018triage process\u2019 to help organisations prioritise which assets to protect or exploit."

        {
            "text": "Alongside this, the document also explores the important concept of knowledge asset ownership. This is especially relevant if a public sector organisation were to engage with another third party in a contract agreement that would generate IP or knowledge assets. When IP rights or ownership are not set out, this could lead to issues around which party has the right to use the IP or knowledge asset at the end of the collaboration. To help guide public sector organisations in understanding this complicated landscape, a simplified model was developed with the key questions to consider, the different types of owners and types of rights available before organisations entered such contracts."

If you\u2019d like any help or advice, please contact KAGuidance@beis.gov.uk and the team will be happy to support."
