[Copyright VolkerStevin 2021]Shortly before Christmas I was happy to complete a major Defence project which has been occupying a lot of my time over the last few years. On 15th December we handed over the Northern Ammunition Jetty at Glen Mallan to our colleagues in Defence Equipment & Support, who will operate it."

In completing this major project, \u00a320m was spent with local suppliers and small and medium enterprises in Scotland."

            "text": "The jetty was last upgraded in the 1970s and had reached the end of its economic life. The upgrade work has not only extended the life of the jetty by an estimated fifty years, but has also made the site accessible for the Royal Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. In fact, HMS Queen Elizabeth visited part way through the work, back in March 2021, in preparation for her first operational deployment. This was not originally planned but became necessary when the scale of the ship\u2019s deployment increased, presenting the team with a challenge to make the jetty operational in time for her arrival. Everyone involved, from DIO, VolkerStevin, Jacobs and the various subcontractors worked closely together to enable HMS Queen Elizabeth to berth at the unfinished jetty, which she did successfully."

            "text": "This was a large and complicated project, as you might imagine from something built in the water. The previous jetty was demolished and replaced with a new 135m long jetty structure, requiring 127 steel piles to be driven into the loch bed to support a reinforced concrete deck. The works also included the installation of navigation aids and five mooring dolphins which are connected to the jetty by a pedestrian access bridge. Two modular fender spacer units have been placed in front of the new fender panels and move with the tide to prevent the overhanging flight decks of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales from colliding with the jetty."

            "text": "In addition, the project included the installation of two modern pedestal cranes to load and unload ammunition and the erection of modular buildings for offices, power generation and stores. The perimeter fencing and CCTV system have also been upgraded to provide a complete modern facility."

            "text": "Sustainability and protecting the environment of Loch Long was an important consideration for me and the rest of the project team. we used capture blankets to prevent material from entering the water when the old jetty was demolished. All jetty demolition waste was transported on barges offsite to recycling facilities on the Clyde to minimise disruption to the public and is being reused for construction. To avoid the need to lay new electric cables through the water, the new navigation aids are solar powered."

[Copyright VolkerStevin]There were concerns about the possible impact of noisy piling works on marine mammals, so two observers used underwater listening devices, along with visual inspections, to make sure no marine mammals were in the area before work began. If any were located, work was stopped to give them time to move away."
