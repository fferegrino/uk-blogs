For many people, this trend has substantially quickened over the last couple of years, as the pandemic has led us to live, work and consume online more than ever before. The large digital firms which dominate these markets influence our lives every day, their algorithms shaping the content, goods and services we choose. These choices also affect thousands of businesses across the UK, which rely on the large digital firms to advertise, distribute and sell. It is therefore crucial that digital markets operate effectively."

These reforms include the new online safety regime, reforms to data protection law, as well as the new pro-competition regime for digital markets, for which the CMA\u2019s Digital Markets Unit will be responsible. The future regulatory landscape for big tech is one of the biggest challenges facing governments across the globe \u2013 now is your chance to join us and play a part in shaping it."
