            "text": "The HomeGrownHouse (HGH) research project challenges this status quo by exploring new, value-added uses for coppiced sweet chestnut in buildings in the SE of England, where the highest number of new-start building projects sit alongside the most abundant coppiced sweet chestnut. Yet the opportunities this presents for sustainable local timber use are being missed."

            "text": "The UK imports 80% of its wood products and only 59% of UK woodlands are under active management. Many formerly coppiced woodlands have fallen out of regular harvest cycles, are more prone to diseases and pests, and contain a mixture of small, medium and large diameter trees with few markets."
        },
        {
            "text": "The HGH project addresses these issues by designing building components with a range of small, medium and large diameter roundwood in mind. We designed a building \u2018kit of parts\u2019 with a low-waste, high yield philosophy, leading to components that are cost-competitive with imported alternatives. To achieve milling efficiency, new radial cutting techniques were tested for repeatability on mobile sawmills, ensuring they could be reproduced elsewhere in the UK."

        {
            "text": "When coppiced, sweet chestnut re-grows multiple, straight lengths of roundwood from each \u2018stool\u2019. Coppicing is also naturally regenerative and harvesting in this way encourages higher levels of biodiversity than other monoculture woodlands. Coppice forestry also creates skilled rural jobs. By linking forestry practices, ecology and construction, the HGH project has forged new connections that contribute to a holistic, sustainable and local timber supply chain."

The timber structures were shown alongside the forestry machinery used for extraction, communicating the links between ecological woodland management practices, high quality locally grown timber, and sustainable building design. HGH also featured at COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference."
