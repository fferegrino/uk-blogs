            "text": "Ice cream began as a delicacy reserved only for the extremely wealthy \u2013 first appearing in the UK in 1671 at a Windsor Castle banquet. But since then, ice cream has become a treat treasured by all."

            "text": "No one played a bigger role in bringing ice cream out of banquet halls and into the streets for everyone to enjoy than Carlo Gatti. Gatti was, however, faced with a tough task. Without the modern-day luxuries of freezers and ice machines, he and other likeminded culinary entrepreneurs had to store ice cut during the winter from ponds or canals in the coldest spaces they could find within an electricity-less London - underneath the canals!"

        {
            "text": "The large amount of labour needed for this process is what had made ice cream such an exclusive treat. But as these ice distribution networks improved and manufacturing costs lowered, ice cream became more widely available."
        },
        {
            "text": "In the mid-19th century Gatti, for example, began to sell ice cream from his stall at the Hungerford Market in Charing Cross. His signature dish - penny licks - named for their price, quickly became popular amongst the general public who, for the first time, could afford such a luxury."

            "text": "More than a century has passed, and technological changes have made the frozen sweets industry unrecognisable from Gatti\u2019s time. But some things, as they say, never change."

While some have been around for some time, such as Unilever (since 1937), the industry is expanding rapidly. 64% of all operating ice cream manufacturers have been incorporated since 2015, with 222 of those since 2020."

            "text": "Despite the historical reputation of ice cream as a seaside treat, much of the recent increase in registrations has been fuelled by companies registered in London*, with a quarter (24%) of registrations coming from the capital."

        {
            "text": "While Gatti may receive much of the credit for the popularity of ice cream among the general public, the industry now has many similarly creative cold treat connoisseurs who would give him a run for his money. They've helped to turn penny licks into iconic desserts such as the knickerbocker glory and they're keeping ice cream relevant in today\u2019s social media age."

They make it a truly Instagram-worthy treat and keep people coming back for seconds (or thirds), more than a century after Carlo\u00a0Gatti\u00a0helped introduce ice cream to the UK public.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "While eye catching style may help in attracting some first-time customers, it\u2019s the dedication to quality ice cream that keeps everyone coming back. This formula certainly seems to be working for Ruby Violet, and thankfully their growth has not halted during the pandemic. Instead it has had rather a different effect. While footfall in the parlours was practically non-existent, Julie\u2019s online ice cream business accelerated and is now booming."

Good news for those with a sweet tooth. It seems that ice cream might just be the perfect pick-me-up to provide much needed comfort in these perplexing times."
