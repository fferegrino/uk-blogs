Information such as standard industrial classification (SIC) codes allows for the sorting of companies based on their sector. It's a very helpful tool in identifying business trends in the UK."

            "text": "Companies specialising in computer games and retail are among the most likely to be led by younger people, while companies in the medical and legal fields are frequently led by middle aged businesspeople. The live companies most often run by older people are, on the other hand, spread across a variety of diverse sectors."

            "text": "As evidenced by 2 fashion related SIC codes appearing in the top 5 industry sectors for under 40s, and 3 out of the top 5 for 18 to 24 year olds, the generation gap is particularly notable in fashion and related companies."

In fact, computer game publishing had the highest rate of directors under 40 \u2013 nearly two thirds (62%). A considerable proportion of them, representing more than a quarter (27%) of computer game publishing companies, were under the age of 30. This is further highlighting the important role that young business leaders have in the industry."

After spending a decade working in the design department for the Guardian Newspaper, Guy made the transition to freelance work. After an initial period of purely agency-based work, his illustration career took a flourishing turn, transforming his lifelong interest in fantasy, sci-fi and history into paid work - including computer games."

        {
            "text": "Guy\u2019s insights suggest that the high rate of young directors in computer game publishing companies is not the product of a few young trailblazing executives creating change from the top down. Rather, a large network of talented, young, creative minded workers in the computer game industry are taking advantage of new technology, including social media, to connect and collaborate in building brave new (virtual) worlds."
