Many of the new pubs popping up have a tough time becoming established and the average live pub company has been around for just 6 years."

There has, been a dramatic increase in community interest pubs in the last few years, with 75% of all pubs registering as community interest companies having done so since 2017."

Plunkett was created over a century ago in 1919, with a simple aim - to make communities a better place to live. They do this by implementing sustainable initiatives (often in more rural areas), known as community businesses, which come in the form of shops, cafes, pubs and many more."

In 2016, the town\u2019s only pub was under threat of being purchased by property developers. With an older population and its remote location, Norton Lindsey is at severe risk of social exclusion. Worried about the prospect of losing a valuable community asset, residents of Norton Lindsey - dubbed the 'Salvation Squad' - came to action. Through help from Plunkett Foundation and the MTAP scheme, they were able to make sure that the pub would remain a part of the community."
