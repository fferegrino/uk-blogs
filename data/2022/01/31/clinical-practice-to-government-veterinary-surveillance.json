My first job really was what most new graduate vets dream of: hit the ground running and go from calving cows to vaccinating kittens and trotting lame horses. I realised very quickly that I had a real passion and enthusiasm for farm animal practice as I enjoyed getting stuck in and chatting to farmers. It did not feel like work going to a farm call and I got a real buzz."

I was very lucky to have very proactive clients who wanted to investigate issues on their farm and focus on preventative health. During this time, I did a four-month secondment to APHA Thirsk as a Veterinary Investigation Officer (VIO) and found it fascinating. I had already been doing on-farm post-mortem examinations (PMEs) as an adjunct to herd and flock health planning so jumped at the chance for more training."

Cases are referred to us from the local area, so it is important we maintain good relationships with local vets to gain surveillance material. Carcasses can be brought to us by the farmers, or some may be eligible for free carcass collection. I enjoy talking to farmers and as I used to work with some of them in practice and it is nice to have that familiarity and a catch up."

In addition to the training programme offered to VIOs, I have also been very lucky to have supportive colleagues at Thirsk who are willing to share their expertise, and the wider network of SEGs are always on hand to support us with cases. When dealing with complex cases it is always good to have a collaborative approach."

However, a much-esteemed lecturer at Liverpool once told my year group, \u201cif you hear hooves, it is probably a horse, but it could be a zebra, never forget that.\u201d. This modification of the saying is the one I always have in mind in the post-mortem room. We always need our eyes and ears open to the possibility of notifiable diseases."
