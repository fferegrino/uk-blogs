            "text": "What we do know, is that Scotland and whisky have gone hand and hand for a long time. The first records of whisky, then called the water of life, appear at the end of the 15th century and its production was likely an established practice by then."

From 2008 to 2011 there were 4 continuous years of stagnation or shrinkage in terms of the number of distilleries in Scotland. The worst of these years came in 2010 when only 3 new distilleries opened up while 21 shut down."

For example, although 22 Scottish distilleries closed in 2018 (the second highest of any year on record) the industry continued its growth, with 59 distilleries incorporated in 2018 still in operation today."

            "text": "For such an old and distinguished industry, Scottish Distilleries have had quite a volatile decade. It was hit hard by the recession and began to shrink rapidly. Then it rebounded and rapidly expanded. And now it has become such a popular industry that, while the number of closures rival the recession years, it's still experiencing growth overall."
