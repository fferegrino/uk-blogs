        {
            "text": "But, sadly, not all letters are created the same. More companies would naturally start with A than Z, for example, because far more words start with A than Z. To account for this, the entire English dictionary underwent a review to determine the percentage of words in the English language that begin with each letter. This allows for the comparison of company beginning letters to the word beginning letters in the English language, thus revealing which letters are more popular with live companies than in everyday use."

            "text": "While S and P have always been underrepresented among companies, C has fallen out of favour more recently. Until the mid-90s C was just as popular with live companies as it was in words, but has been on the decline ever since."
