From local reading groups and spaces for community meetings to talks by favourite authors - booksellers have long provided a variety of services far beyond what typical high street retailers offer. This, however, has not protected booksellers from the rise of e-commerce giants such as Amazon."

Yet in the past few years booksellers have managed to minimise the shrinkage of their industry. Perhaps those such as Round Table Books have shown that their value extends far beyond mere convenience, that, despite the unmatched inventory of online retailers, bookshops still offer something that their internet rivals cannot: a connection to the community."

            "text": "And while we cannot necessarily make an in-person trip to our local bookshops in these more restrictive times, there are still ways to 'support local' while you 'stay safe'. Various e-commerce sites, such as hive.co.uk, have been set up to support independent bookshops with every sale, helping to make sure that our beloved bibliopoles withstand these testing times."
