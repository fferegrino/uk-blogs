The goal is to optimise resource efficiency, improve automatic data collection for fish stock assessment, provide evidence of compliance with fishery regulations and reduce the ecological impact of the industry. Cefas Principal Scientist and Project Lead, Tom Catchpole, reflects here on research outcomes achieved by Cefas scientists, industry, and research partners."

This includes novel fishing gears to avoid unwanted catches, automatic catch data collection and data sharing tools, with the aim to enhance scientific advice and better inform decision-making by fisheries managers."

Working with the skipper and crews of mixed-species trawlers in the southwest of England, and the University of East Anglia\u2019s (UEA) School of Computing Sciences team, CatchMonitor has been developed to automatically identify and count fish during the catch sorting process using video footage from onboard cameras. Researchers are also working in collaboration with small-scale fishers who use pots to catch crabs and lobsters in the English Channel and southern North Sea, and with Bangor University to develop the CatchCam system that also collects detailed data on catches."

            "text": "There are essential benefits to producing better catch data for both the commercial fishing and research sector. For fishers, detailed catch information enables them to optimise the use of the fish quotas available to them, thus improving the economic efficiency of their businesses. This also means unintended catches can be reduced, in turn minimising the fishing pressure and ecosystem impacts. For scientists, improved catch data means more confidence in the advice provided on the sustainable levels of fishing and the ability to inform decisions and policy. For example, data on European crab and lobster stocks are limited; this restricts the management options for the sustainable exploitation of these stocks. Improved catch information can also inform fisheries managers on levels of compliance with regulations and can be used as the basis for developing effective new management measures to support stock sustainability."

            "text": "Discarding of unwanted fish catches is generally highest in bottom trawl fisheries that catch a mix of different species together. We tested the use of adding artificial lights to trawls to increase the possible escape of unwanted fish and reduce discards. Working onboard a beam trawler in the southwest of England with our project partner Interfish, and with individual skippers of otter trawlers in the English Channel and North Sea, the new SmartGear light technology was trialled in various positions on the trawls. The new technology, which can be remotely programmed to produce different types of light delivered through a flexible fibre optic cable, stood up to the rigorous test of being attached to trawls during commercial fishing operations. The experiments showed that individual species will react differently to the light output. This new technology has the potential to improve the selectivity of nets by modifying the behaviour of fish during the trawling process resulting in a reduction of discards."

Installing artificial lights on fishing gear is increasingly being explored to alter the behaviour of fish during the capture process and to improve trawl selectivity. For lights to be readily accepted and used by the fishing industry, they need to be robust enough to withstand the stresses encountered during the towing and hauling processes, be versatile enough to utilise fish responses to different light configurations and improve selectivity without negatively impacting on target catches."

This means that assumptions have to be made about how characteristic the data are, particularly for those catches that are returned to the sea, and for some species, the limited data will influence management decisions and restrict fishing opportunities. In recent years, Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) has offered an additional tool for collecting scientific fisheries data, with the potential to help fill these data gaps."

This will improve the efficiency of video review, enabling larger samples of data to be analysed, releasing the full potential of REM and providing data-rich fisheries management."

The first task was to train the algorithm to recognise and identify fish, meaning video reviewers had to generate a large training dataset, an example of annotated training images can be seen below. Once trained to recognise fish in still images, the algorithm then needed to be able to do this from a video and keep track of the individual fish to be able to count them accurately - not easy as they move along the conveyor belt. The Cefas reviewers generated data on 13,543 fish, from 5 hours of video footage from two vessels fishing in the Celtic Sea."

            "text": "We started at the very beginning of this process and have made substantial progress. The performance of the algorithm was compared against results from three reviewers, with the total count of all fish, the total counts of different species and the identification of the same individual fish as points for direct comparison. For one vessel, the total counts of the algorithm were comparable to the reviewers, while the other was lower. For both vessels, the proportion of different species in the catch from the algorithm matches closely with the reviewers. For some species, the algorithm showed the same level of precision when identifying individual fish as the reviewers, but for others it was lower, reflecting the level of training data available for the different species, the quality of the images, and the density of the fish in the images."

To send and centralize all the data coming from the onboard camera units, an application programming interface (API), a SQL database, and a web application were constructed.

Working with fish market operators and market sampling staff in the southwest of England, we investigated the practicalities of collecting data from these machines - evaluating the completeness of the machine data - and compared it to data collected by our scientists in the market sampling programme."

The next step in this research is to design a hybrid sampling approach that effectively combines these different data sources.\u201d"
