That\u2019s it. No more information.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even realise how significant the war in Burma was until I was an adult and I never met my grandfather to ask him about his experience.\u00a0 But a few years ago following a story I read about during south Asian Heritage Month it prompted me to ask questions and verify our family story with family members."

He and other South Asians should be celebrated for the freedoms we enjoy today, but this will only happen if we share the history.\u00a0 I\u2019m also proud that this month will highlight many more stories like mine. So if you have any information about your family heritage, take the time to ask some questions and share.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m definitely in the \u2018foodie\u2019 category of South Asians but I know we have great stories to share over a meal\u2026\""

Cold Milo milk after swimming in the sea, Hopper pancakes at breakfast, fresh mangoes and coconuts from the garden, the umami-ness\u00a0of Maldive fish sambols and the smell of cinnamon, cardamom, cumin and cloves wafting through the air."

It allows me to navigate and strengthen ties with family who live in a world, now so culturally different from my own. I am indebted to the power of the lentil \u2013 my love for dhal in all its forms (chana, urad, moong, parrippu curry) has allowed me to connect with, and cook for, other Sri-Lankans and South Asians in the UK. Bring me into any conversation about my mum\u2019s recipe and I will happily talk for hours. That\u2019s what, in essence, South Asian History Month means to me \u2013 traversing the paths of my childhood and bringing others along with me\""

Growing up in the UK, I didn\u2019t always feel represented in the media, hence why I feel so grateful for initiatives such as SAHM."
