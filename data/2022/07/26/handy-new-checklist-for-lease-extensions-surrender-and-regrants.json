Where such variations mean the existing lease cannot simply be extended by deed \u2013 for example, land is added or removed, or the term extended or reduced \u2013 that lease is deemed to have been surrendered and a completely new one created. This is a surrender and regrant application and follows the usual requirements for registering a dispositionary first lease."
