Today, we\u2019ll be understanding why it\u2019s crucial to keep your personal information up to date in the Rural Payments Service and hear some great tips on how to update your details. We\u2019ll also take a look at the importance of \u2018setting permissions\u2019 in the Rural Payments Service, and what this means for your business. We\u2019re in the peak season for agricultural shows, so we\u2019ll be talking shows and events, and later in the episode we\u2019ll provide a roundup of the very latest information and updates, and answer some of your questions."

The Rural Payments Agency uses the data held in the Rural Payments Service to send out prompts, reminders, and other helpful material, so it\u2019s vital that farming businesses keep their details up to date. I\u2019m now joined by Daneka Rodgers, Senior Business Analyst at the RPA, to explore this further and understand why this is so important \u2013 both for the RPA and farmers, land managers and agents across the country. Daneka, welcome to The RPA Podcast."

            "text": "Daneka: It was, we recently contacted around 86,000 farmers and agents but a number of the emails that we sent were never actually received because the email addresses held by us were incorrect. In some cases, businesses hadn\u2019t entered an email address at all which means that we need to send them a paper copy, which then obviously takes more time. The advance in BPS payments was a prompt, but it\u2019s vital we hold the correct personal and payment information for farmers and land managers all year round."

It\u2019s really important to sign into the Rural Payments service regularly, as we use \u2018pop up\u2019 alerts to share important information with you, such as any upcoming downtime to help us improve the service, as well as application and claim reminders."

Once a person has been added to your business, you can allocate them \u2018permissions\u2019, which will allow them to take certain actions on behalf of you and your business. Using permissions can give you greater flexibility which you may find helpful especially at busy times."

So it\u2019s important to check you have the right permissions set up in your account, because this can affect who can apply for payments, submit applications and make claims on behalf of you and your business. You can check and confirm permissions by going to the \u2018Business overview\u2019 section in the Rural Payments service and clicking on \u2018Give access to this business\u2019."

A person with \u2018Full\u2019 Business Permissions can act on behalf of a business in its entirety, including adding and removing people from that business, allocating their permissions. I\u2019d encourage all your listeners to look at the information available in the Rural Payments service, where you can find full details about what each Business Permission will allow a person to do before they allocate them."

Underneath each permission level in the Rural Payments service, there are details of what a person with that authority can do.

Instead, we use the \u2018business level permissions\u2019 to determine if someone has been permitted to talk to us on behalf of a business about Environmental Stewardship. So, if you want to allow someone to talk to us on your behalf about this scheme, you need to link them to your business and set them with \u2018Make Legal Changes\u2019 or \u2018Full\u2019 business permissions. Alternatively, if that\u2019s not an option for you, you can send us a completed \u2018es21: Agent authorisation form\u2019, which can be found on gov.uk, to inform us who will be managing Environmental Stewardship agreements and claims for that business."

Also, if possible, please reply to the original request from us when emailing documents, but if you can\u2019t respond to the original request, please make sure you include the name of the scheme and what the email is about in the subject line\u2026oh, and please also put your name and your Single Business Identifier \u2013 your SBI - in the body of the email."

And as you\u2019ve said, my role is Senior Stakeholder Manager & Shows and Events Lead, and the two roles tie in very nicely. It\u2019s all about engaging from the business out into the industry and also listening to what\u2019s being said to us."

            "text": "Katie: I really feel passionately about how important it is. For the vast majority of our partners, visiting the RPA stand at one of our events is the only face to face contact they might have with us. Attending these events provides us with the insight into how our customers and stakeholders feel about our future and existing schemes. Which given where we are at the moment in the farming landscape that is incredibly important. We gain insight into how our customer engagement strategies are landing with the industry. It provides the opportunity to promote existing and future schemes to customers. We provide a high quality, joined up customer service across all our schemes. I think that\u2019s really important for me and my team to make sure that we\u2019ve got a wide breadth of knowledge and we can answer as many customer queries as we possibly can. We\u2019re continually refreshing our approach with farmers and land managers as we use the insight gained to influence delivery and inform the development of future schemes. We also have a lot of Ministers and MPs visit the RPA stand when attending events. They see our first-hand engagement efforts and that group is one that\u2019s keen for us to go to a number of other shows as well. I think meeting customers at events provides us with a really unique way of gathering feedback which does influence the way we write guidance and design our processes."

            "text": "James: RPA and Defra often attend the shows together, so this adds I guess, further benefits for attendees, but there\u2019s also a benefit for colleagues across RPA attending as well."
        },
        {
            "text": "Katie: Yes, of course. So RPA and Defra Future Farming colleagues have been successfully co-locating at shows for about the last eighteen months now. We often have Forestry Commission and Catchment Sensitive Farming colleagues join us too. This really gives a joined-up approach, and it offers customers the opportunity to talk through a range of issues to a number of delivery bodies in one place. If we\u2019re talking about RPA staff and the benefits of that, we promote the programme that we deliver as part of our learning and development for colleagues. I just feel this is such an excellent opportunity, for all grades, to attend and come and be supported by members of my shows and events team, which gives staff the chance to have the face-to-face interaction and hear from the industry. And again, that\u2019s really important for our staff because it makes their day job really come to life and why we do what we do."

            "text": "Katie: Meeting customers at events provides this unique feedback which influences why we do so many things \u2013 policy, guidance, internal processes. Having this early insight into how the industry is feeling allows us to feed that back into the agency and it\u2019s given quite a high profile within RPA, on how our shows and events are going, and what kind of things are coming up with the industry and where we maybe need to do a little bit more."

            "text": "James: And you\u2019ve touched on the insights you and the team receive when attending the shows but what information is available on the RPA stand and can visitors discuss any issues they might have with RPA colleagues at the show?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Katie: Yes, absolutely, and we will always do what we can to help and take away things we might not be able to answer on the day. So RPA is primarily there to field queries from farmers and agents across all current and future schemes \u2013 specifically the Sustainable Farming Incentive, Farming Investment Fund grants and CS. At the stand itself, we have a range of leaflets, lots of great literature on CS and the different elements of the scheme, woodland and also SFI. We also have the opportunity for customers to have a quick watch of the SFI \u2018How to apply\u2019 video. So, lots of good, interesting things on the stand as well. What I\u2019ve found is most customer queries have focused on what the future holds, in terms of current an new schemes and what support was going to be available once BPS reduces. This is obviously a really wide-reaching feeling within the industry. Many of the farmers were interested in grant support and when future rounds would be open for applying. And this is all in a really tough time with people\u2019s concerns being on rising costs and food production."

Last week we were at the Great Yorkshire show which had an incredible turnout and just a really great event."

Then we have the National Sheep Association in Worcestershire on 27th July. We then kind of tail off a little bit for August \u2013 August is an incredibly busy month in the farming community, so we take that time to reorganise and reset, and then we gear up again for September. For anyone that is listening and that has Twitter, if you can follow the RPA, you\u2019ll see updates from me on where we\u2019re going to be and, also nearer to the event, I\u2019ll pop stand information number and things, so it\u2019s always easy for our customers to find us."

            "text": "Katie: I think James, in 2023, we\u2019re going to be looking to expand our programme even further. We\u2019ve mentioned before lots of requests are coming into us, and our attendance at these events is proving quite valuable. So next year we are hoping to also be part of the Royal Cheshire County Show and the Organic Food and Farming Conference, just to name a few."

        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: So James, just before we get down to an update, I thought it would be useful just to give you and people listening a bit of an insight or context setting around what SFI is. So, at its core, SFI\u2019s around incentivising and rewarding sustainable actions that support food production and enhance environmental outcomes. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that SFI is part of a wider environmental land management approach, which was a key aspect of the agricultural transition, which also includes Landscape Recovery and Local Nature Recovery. The full set of standards we\u2019re expecting to be ready by 2025, and that is essentially focusing on improving water quality, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and animal health and welfare. But like anything we\u2019ve talked about, the incremental nature of the agricultural transition period, we\u2019ve started simply, focusing on actions and standards to essentially improve soil health, to recognise the importance of moorland and to improve animal health and welfare. The standards have been designed working with farmers, and I think that\u2019s really important for people to understand, and actually as I said, we\u2019ll introduce new ones over the next few years. We get a lot of questions around eligibility, so who is eligible to apply for SFI. So initially it\u2019s open to farmers claiming BPS, and I think that\u2019s an important aspect of the consideration. I know a lot of farmers that undertake a lot of the actions that sit within the standards but actually can\u2019t be bothered with the paperwork. And actually what I\u2019m hoping we will see, as and when we deliver SFI, and SFI matures as a scheme, that they\u2019ll look to embrace the scheme and be rewarded for the things in most cases they are doing already. So, it is open to everyone, those that are in existing environmental schemes \u2013 at the moment that\u2019s predominantly Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship \u2013 can apply but they\u2019ll need to call the RPA and actually we will support them through the application process. I think that\u2019s really, really important for people to understand. I think that one of the things that also comes across in terms of questions is \u2018can I apply for SFI if I\u2019m in CS or I\u2019m in ES?\u2019. And actually, an element of that is around yes you can, but actually we won\u2019t be able to be providing funding for the same actions. So actually if you\u2019re doing something in one scheme, we\u2019re not going to be able to reward you for doing the same actions in another scheme. So actually you can complement the two schemes but essentially they have to be delivering different actions. One of the things that we\u2019ve often heard as well from farmers is the inflexibility around the application windows, so it\u2019s really good to see that for SFI, there are no application windows. Farmers can apply when it suits them best, and actually that\u2019s really helpful in the way that it adds a degree of flexibility. And obviously we\u2019ll issue quarterly payments once the agreements have started. We\u2019ve opened up a new service to apply, and actually what\u2019s really interesting about the approach that we\u2019ve taken, it includes some automated checks, and actually these checks are making it simpler and more straightforward. We\u2019ve been working with farmers to learn from their experience of using the service and actually we\u2019ve been able to introduce some measures that have improved that experience. So actually everything is working quite nicely, everything that farmers need to know about the scheme and application process is available on rpa.gov.uk, and I\u2019d encourage farmers to get involved."

            "text": "James: SFI applications opened on 30th June, so are you pleased with the initial response?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: So I think the initial feedback from farmers has been really good. But you know, as with any rollout, there will always be learning for us to consider. Farmers are applying and that\u2019s really great to see. They are telling us that the process has been easy to follow. The upfront checks have made things simpler for us, and what we\u2019ve been able to do is process applications quicker. Our aim is to get agreement offers out within two months, but in truth, some of the applications are being processed a lot quicker than that. Which I think is really helpful, and if you compare that to the existing schemes we currently have which can take up to four-to-five months plus, I think getting things out quicker is a really great improvement that we\u2019ve made. And actually, as I\u2019ve said before, the link between the start of the agreement offer, and the payment is really, really important. So, payments will be flowing on a quarterly basis, as soon as the agreement has started. But we know this is a really busy time for farmers and actually again, the advantage of having a rolling window means that farmers can apply when they\u2019re ready to apply, which I think is really, really helpful."

        {
            "text": "James: Yes, and you touched on something earlier I just want to focus on, and that\u2019s some in the farming community have raised concerns about compliance, enforcement and regulation, particularly of SFI, but I understand there will be greater flexibility when it comes to visits and monitoring?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, so this is a new approach for us. When I speak to farmers, I talk a lot about the link between the policy prescriptions and our ability to apply flex. So in the SFI standards we\u2019ve described some minimum actions which will help to deliver the aims of the standards but actually we\u2019re really focused on trusting farmers to do the how, and actually working with them in terms of the outcomes we want to achieve. As I\u2019ve said before, many of the actions that sit within the standards farmers do already. One of the key things in there will be a move away from applying penalties. Where we find something that isn\u2019t in accordance with the agreement, we\u2019ll work with the farmer to figure out how we can remedy the situation collectively. But I think there\u2019s an important thing to make clear here; we have a number of considerations that we need to balance in the delivery of our schemes. Obviously a desire to work with farmers to deliver environmental outcomes is high on our agenda, but we also have an obligation to protect taxpayers\u2019 money to ensure that it is prudently spent. But like out approach to our new service, there will be learning that we will need to consider as and when we rollout our particular visits."

We\u2019re going to do a blog on it, we\u2019re going to do some case studies on farmers that have had existing visits and how it felt for them. And actually I\u2019m going to go out on a few visits myself and just speak to farmers and get first-hand how they felt their experiences were. And I\u2019ll give you a good example; so I was in Hastings a couple of weeks ago, speaking to a room of farmers. One farmer, at the end, came up to me and said how grateful he was around the support that he received from one of our field officers at a recent visit. So, it\u2019s beginning to land, it\u2019s beginning to have the outcomes that we wanted. So actually I think a positive step."

            "text": "James: Great, and I understand RPA will be publishing a blog on this towards the end of July with further information as well. Moving onto the Basic Payment Scheme Sandy\u2026The BPS advance payments announcement in May was welcomed by all parties, particularly at a time when we\u2019ve got rising prices and cash flow challenges, and I understand payments have already started to flow through the system?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, as you\u2019ve mentioned, I think the announcement was well-received by farmers across the country. I think the RPA in particular knows the importance of cash flow to rural businesses. And certainly we understand the impact that these BPS advances will make given the challenging times that we\u2019re facing. We announced on 19th July that payments had begun to be issued. I expect the majority of farmers to receive their payment by the end of July. There will be a small number of claims that will require additional processing, and what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll be in touch with farmers who are affected but we\u2019ll continue to release BPS advances across August, once this further work has been completed. Payments will broadly be around 50% of the value of the claim, but there will be some variances as there always are. What we\u2019ll do is when we issue the balance payments from December, we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments. Importantly, for both advances and balance payments, farmers will get a remittance advice and that\u2019s something that they\u2019re used to getting before, and actually claim statements will be issued after the balance payments have been made from December. I think, every year we sit on payments that we\u2019ve issued, and actually this is a call for action for those people that haven\u2019t provided us with their updated contact details. It\u2019s always interesting to see money sitting with the RPA when it should be in farmers\u2019 banks accounts because they haven\u2019t provided us with their up-to-date banking details. More details about how farmers can update their details with us can be found on rpa.gov.uk."

        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: Yes, I was really pleased to speak to farmers who told me they were interested in the scheme, and, as farmers may be aware, the application process for the lump sum closes at the end of September. But there are a number of actions that farmers will need to undertake around their land.\u00a0 You can sell it, you can rent it out for a minimum of five years, you can surrender your tenancy, or you can plant trees under a woodland creation scheme. A lot of those actions need to be completed by 31 May 2024, but also farmers can retain up to five hectares of their land and still receive their lump sum payment. Most of the information around some of the schemes are available on rpa.gov.uk. But I think this is an important consideration for farmers as and when they think about their future business and how they want to progress and how they want to bring others on into the industry."

        },
        {
            "text": "Sandy: So, the first round of the new Slurry Infrastructure grants, which are worth around \u00a313 million, will open up later this autumn. The key focus of them is to help livestock farmers in England to upgrade their slurry storage and nutrient management systems and essentially, in so doing, help reduce water and air pollution from slurry. More information again is available on the gov.uk pages, and I think farmers will need to search for \u201cSlurry Infrastructure grant\u201d. I think the important thing with all of these schemes as and when we move across the agricultural transition period, that they have been co-designed with farmers, and actually I think that\u2019s really, really important. But actually not just farmers but industry and environmental experts. The application process is again similar to what farmers are used to applying for. So, it\u2019s a two-stage process, starting with an online eligibility checker, which will open in the autumn, followed by a full application process over the winter. So there will be multiple opportunities to apply for a grant. So if you\u2019re not successful in the first round, there will be other rounds over the next couple of years or so. And actually we\u2019ll produce, publish more detail on the grant over the summer ahead of applications opening in the autumn."

            "text": "Sandy: Yes, so Secretary of State announced a new \u00a330 million fund in June. It applies to England only but offers grants focused on supporting farmers and growers to process, diversify and add value to their eligible agricultural products after they are harvested or reared.\u202fImportantly it offers grants of between \u00a325,000 and \u00a3300,000 for up to 40% of eligible project costs.\u202fSo essentially what that means is farmers can buy new premises or equipment for the preparation or processing of agricultural produce. Turning milk into cheese or yoghurt for instance, processing meat into sausages, and potatoes into crisps or chips; or equipment such as vending machines and display facilities for selling food directly to customers. Although the online checker closed on 21 July, there will be a scoring mechanism and actually if your score is high enough, you\u2019ll be invited to submit a full application, which will need to be sent with supporting documents into the Agency by email.\u202fSuccessful projects will be provided with details about how to do this when the scheme opens for applications later in the year, and you\u2019ll have until 31 January 2024 to submit the full application. If you need planning permission, then this must be approved and submitted with your full application. And I know there are instances of where that is a really difficultly at the moment with local authorities, so actually what I would urge farmers to do is get in touch with us if they have planning permission consideration challenges and we can discuss with them about the things that we can do."

And actually, it reflects what we\u2019ve been able to undertake over the last year or so, in a way that actually is more engaging than we\u2019ve been able to do in the past. It has been a challenging year for many people and actually as and when we come out of the pandemic and move into an element of normality, I think it\u2019s been good to be able to reflect on the progress that the Agency has made, and our focus on delivering for agricultural and rural communities to create a better place to live. So, the Annual Report and Accounts is available on gov.uk, it highlights some of our ambitions that were published in our five-year strategy in February 2021. In particular focusing on the things that we are doing to listen, learn and do better. Focusing on how we want to build partnerships with farmers, how we\u2019re working closely with industry stakeholder groups and associations, how we\u2019re focusing on improving the services that we currently provide. So it\u2019s a good read, but I would say that, I\u2019ve read it, but you can read it by finding it on gov.uk."
