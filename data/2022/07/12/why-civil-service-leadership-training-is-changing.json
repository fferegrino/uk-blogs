While some people can seem like natural born leaders, none of us arrive in the workplace with all the skills, knowledge, and networks we need. They are carefully nurtured with precise, effective support. And faced with a dizzying array of complex problems to solve and services to deliver for the public, it\u2019s arguably never been more important to invest in the shared knowledge and expertise of our current and future leaders and managers. The recent publication \u2018Leading to Deliver: A Leadership and Management Prospectus\u2019 outlines how civil servants can gain and improve the skills they need to face 21st Century challenges."

To do these things, we need brilliant individuals, but we also need teams with a sense of shared purpose, working together to achieve exemplary outcomes for the UK."

The college will also use the Government Campus\u2019 physical locations in the Midlands, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber. By offering access to in-person learning here, leaders get much-needed face-to-face training that will ideally be closer to the communities in which they work. Our locations will also create opportunities for regionally-focussed network building events."
