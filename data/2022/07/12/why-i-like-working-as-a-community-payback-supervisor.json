Due to various challenges, including things like homelessness or mental health issues, many live quite chaotic lives. They\u2019re not necessarily bad people \u2013 just individuals who\u2019ve made poor choices that have led to them having to do CP as part of a community sentence for an offence. We\u2019re not here to judge them for what they\u2019ve done. Our job as supervisors is to lead from the front and motivate the people in our groups to complete their Community Payback.\u201d"

You do get some who are disruptive or not pulling their weight, and you sometimes experience anti-social behaviour. But, ultimately, if you handle the situation right you can diffuse it and turn it around \u2013 which is satisfying."
