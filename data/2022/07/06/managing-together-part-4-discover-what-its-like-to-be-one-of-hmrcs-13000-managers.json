As I loved the management side of the job, I decided a change of career would suit me, so began both an MA Leadership/Management, and my search for a new role. A family member spoke so highly of HMRC as a great employer, having had a 30-year career within the department, I was encouraged to apply to work here."

I plan and organise using day-to-day to-do lists, in order of priority, around scheduled meetings. This enables me to manage my time during the day and fit in unexpected ad-hoc tasks and meetings, making time to chat to my team!"

            "text": "Rather than dictating what my colleagues need to do each day, they use a query portal to assign themselves tasks. This helps to give autonomy, allows flexibility and increases engagement and a sense of satisfaction when completing tasks. There are a variety of jobs to be done daily, and by getting to know my team better, considering their strengths and needs, I know what they thrive on, so this helps when organising the daily flow of work."

            "text": "As well as daily well-being chats, checking everyone is ok, I plan regular chats with my team regarding development and trying new tasks. This helps me to set achievable goals, ensuring deadlines are met without compromising quality over quantity. Having these chats about workload means I can replan work and reassess delegated tasks if needs be. In addition to this, we have flexible working, which has built mutual respect and trust throughout the team. For example, if an extended break is needed then colleagues know they can do this, knowing no-one takes advantage, and I can plan accordingly if needed."

This has involved budgeting and hiring of staff, which I\u2019ve found has helped with my planning and organising skills. I am excited and proud that this July will see me flying out to Kenya to assist a school with no tech facilities. We will be providing the school with projectors, helping to improve the education and learning experiences of the disadvantaged children there. I have found that this charity work has helped me lead my team in HMRC. Learning the need to adapt to situations and prioritise accordingly, while also seeing the benefit of different personalities within a group, some people being leaders, some followers."

We have such positivity throughout our team, and I\u2019m pleased that I often hear how welcoming and friendly our department is. Staff feel well looked after, and comment how our managers are approachable and open to conversation, and I can honestly say this is something I have experienced for myself since joining HMRC."
