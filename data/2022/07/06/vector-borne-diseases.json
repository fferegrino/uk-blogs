The vector borne group of diseases is diverse and includes parasites, bacteria and viruses that are transmitted by a range of arthropod vectors, including biting insects and ticks."

            "text": "Many VBDs occurring in animals have the potential to cause human infection meaning this group of diseases includes many important zoonotic infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that more than 17% of all infectious diseases in people are caused by vector-borne diseases, causing more than 700,000 deaths annually."

Research, particularly using molecular methods, are helping us develop an increased understanding of the pathogens, vectors, and vector-host interactions. Research advances have globally accelerated the discovery of new diseases and improved knowledge on managing, preventing and treating VBDs."

We have research specialists in vector borne disease and a veterinary surveillance network and carry out a wide range of VBD work including vector competence studies, diagnostics and monitoring of endemic livestock diseases and screening for new and emerging vector-borne disease in livestock, companion animals and wildlife."

WNV is carried by birds and can cause notifiable disease in humans and horses. Although present in southern Europe for decades, the UK is currently free of the disease."

Although less virulent in humans and horses, it can cause a lethal disease in certain species of birds, particularly the common (Eurasian) blackbird."
