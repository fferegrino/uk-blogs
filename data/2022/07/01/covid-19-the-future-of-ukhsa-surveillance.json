            "text": "These systems help us track prevalence of the virus across the United Kingdom, detect new variants and in turn analyse both their transmissibility and severity. Taken together, these studies allow us to understand the overall impact that different waves and variants have on communities, and how it affects different social, ethnic and age groups. Without them, the government\u2019s ability to make timely public health interventions would be severely hampered."

Surveillance has allowed us to understand the virus, but its vaccines that have impacted COVID-19\u2019s ability to make people seriously ill. Over 50 million people have now had at least one jab, and nearly 40 million have had three. Spring boosters are now being given to the most vulnerable."

This has consisted of regular PCR testing through the National Testing Programme and repeat collection of blood samples. This has enabled analyses into (re)infection levels, variants of concern (VOCs) duration of the immune response from both vaccination and natural infection, and vaccine effectiveness."
