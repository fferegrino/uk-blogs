These provided them with experience of the varied work of the Planning Inspectorate and of the skills needed by our staff. They also highlighted the various routes into the planning profession."

This was supported by a Planning Inspector, who presented a fascinating history of planning and provided an overview, with personal experiences, of their role."

The students were also given the opportunity to review some previous appeal decisions, which gave them insight into the important elements that need to be considered when making a fair, open and impartial decision."
