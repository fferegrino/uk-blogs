            "text": "Since we introduced the ILACS framework in 2018, we have reflected on how we have reported on the experiences of care leavers. Our ILACS currently give a single judgement on \u2018the experiences and progress of children in care and care leavers\u2019; however, we think we can now go further to maximise the profile of care leavers."

We think our proposals will give this significant group of young people a clearer profile in our inspections."

Their message was loud and clear, that our inspections could and should \u2018shine a brighter light\u2019 on how well care leavers are supported into adulthood. We took all of this on board, and we hope you will agree that our proposals can achieve this."

We are also mindful of future changes that will arise from the independent review of children\u2019s social care. In this consultation, we want your views on the most important factors we need to consider when setting out what good looks like for care leavers."

            "text": "We already have a good understanding of this from our recent research \u2018Ready or not\u2019: care leavers\u2019 views of preparing to leave care. We know that care leavers\u2019 views need to be at the forefront of our evaluation, and inspections need to acknowledge the additional barriers that care-experienced young adults may face. Involving care leavers in the development of plans for their future can make a real difference to them leading happy and fulfilled lives while they are in care and as adults; these must be central pillars of our evaluation."

We see time and again in our reports that effective leaders with a good line of sight to the frontline of their services make a positive difference to the experiences of children. Our survey invites you to consider how your suggestions about the judgement for care leavers should affect our judgement on \u2018the impact of leaders on social work practice with children and families\u2019."

All local authorities will have had their earlier single inspection framework judgements \u2018replaced\u2019 by judgements under the current arrangements and we will have evaluated all local authorities against a consistent framework. That\u2019s why we think this is an opportune moment to make this important change."
