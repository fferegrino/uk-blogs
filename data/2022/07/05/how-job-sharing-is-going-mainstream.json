Polly had been job-sharing with someone who went to work in the private sector; she wanted to stay in the Civil Service so we advertised for a job-share partner and got over 40 applicants. Polly met them all - a bit like speed dating - and decided Ruth would be the best fit. This was based on shared values and similar ways of working. Our skills, expertise and experiences were very different - which we think is an advantage.\u00a0"

It\u2019s excellent for resilience, both providing time to decompress and step back, but also - importantly - providing two heads on any challenge and inbuilt moral support on difficult issues. This has been invaluable for us in many of our roles, and also brings real benefits for the organisation as it protects against burn out. The organisation also benefits from the more rounded skill set which two people with complementary attributes can bring to a role.\u00a0\u00a0"

We remain strong advocates; our job-share is our superpower - it diversifies and doubles our output, efficiency and opportunities, and ultimately makes the UK a safer place by optimising Counter Terrorism outcomes."
