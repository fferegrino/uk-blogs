Existing online services experienced a huge increase in demand and sometimes could not scale up to meet the increase in traffic. Some critical services weren\u2019t digitised at all, or relied on people being physically present in government offices in order to provide services.\u00a0"

At first, we hosted delegations and talked about our transformation efforts in the UK, but soon we were asked to help even more."

            "text": "There\u2019s a reason why organisations struggle to make digital projects work when they don\u2019t change anything about how they work themselves. Senior leaders must be more than enthusiasts for digital; instead, they need to be equally ambitious to change how they work as an organisation. Crucially, they need to give their staff time to learn new skills or take on critical digital projects. These sorts of changes can\u2019t be tacked onto existing roles, they need dedicated people to unravel thorny legacy technology and organisational challenges."

        {
            "text": "This often takes the form of spend controls, where a finance ministry or digital agency can scrutinise and make interventions in how the government spends its money. It also involves rethinking what a ministry focussed on government technology might do, moving its function closer to the centre of government to affect systematic, cross-government change. Equally, it requires really close coordination at a cross-ministerial level to make those really important transformation decisions. Clear ownership also needs to be established to implement those ambitions."
        },
        {
            "text": "Most digitally mature countries we\u2019ve talked with over the years have all moved to an agile delivery model. \u2018Agile\u2019 means that you prioritise your user needs, testing throughout the development of your product or service, rather than waiting until the very end to test it with users. This helps minimise the risk of building the wrong thing or not delivering the desired outcome, while meeting users' expectations of how a service should work. There\u2019s a whole variety of ways countries manage this, from in-sourcing teams to having strategic supplier relationships, but no matter the arrangement, they always work in an agile way."
        },
        {
            "text": "One thing we\u2019ve learned from reading countless digital strategies is that transformation evolves slowly. It\u2019s measured in decades, not years. So we try to be honest and say how long things will take and that none of it is easy and Governments can be slow to change. Not only do you have to be ambitious, digital agencies or departments have to be prepared for a long-term commitment, constantly challenging the status quo."

            "text": "Collaboration and meeting government objectives, not just departmental objectives, means you can get maximum value from digital transformation. Some agencies hold valuable data that other departments need to streamline their delivery. There needs to be a whole of government approach to making the right decisions to drive user-centred services. By doing so, the potential of big data and automation can be unlocked. No one can succeed alone and collaborative efforts are rewarded with a sustainable digital transformation."

The best thing about working internationally is that it creates a community of people with similar experiences, so we can learn, share knowledge and tackle the next challenges together."
