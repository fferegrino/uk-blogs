I am a veterinarian from Zimbabwe, and a Fleming Fund fellow for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and surveillance, being hosted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. My recent two-week long placement at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) was an eye-opening and life-changing experience in so many ways."

Instruments used to guide this work such as the National Action Plan (2019-2024), and \u201cContained and controlled: 20-year vision for AMR\u201d were introduced. One meeting highlighted the three areas that underpin drafting policy related documents, mainly using scientific evidence, political engagement and consideration for the method of delivery."

            "text": "Engagement with the AMR Surveillance & Evidence team brought to light some parallels that exist between Zimbabwe and the UK with regards to trying to control AMR, and highlighted differences for lesson learning. AMR surveillance in the UK falls into two broad categories, namely harmonized monitoring (VARSS report, Chapter 3); and clinical surveillance (VARSS report, Chapter 4). The focus of harmonized monitoring is human health, assessing zoonotic microorganisms and indicator bacteria such as E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella; and of late they are trialing enterococci. It is harmonized across European countries and laboratory methods are standardized."

            "text": "Clinical surveillance (VARSS report, Chapter 4) is more focused on animal health. Sampling is passive, with samples submitted for diagnostic purposes, and the surveillance system is devolved. Veterinary antimicrobials are used for susceptibility tests. Clinical surveillance provides a snapshot of AMR in organisms causing disease in animals, including zoonotic organisms. It also assists in stewardship programs.\u00a0 A system known as ResAlert is used across both programmes, which is a risk-based management system for new or unusual AMR threats arising from animals."

Knowing and understanding your stakeholders can be the difference between them complying or not complying with good practices. There needs to be a balance between using the carrot and the stick. If the carrot works, the stick is not always necessary for regulators to use. The UK is championing this with regards to industry-led optimization of antimicrobial usage in several species."

            "text": "Using practical and free software is also a starting point in data management and analysis. It is not always necessary to use complicated systems; it is better to start from what is easily understandable, usable, and available to get the message across. In other words, scientific evidence is evidence; no matter the tools used to bring it out. The implementers can build and develop more robust systems as time goes on."

It was an insightful visit, which I would recommend to any professional involved in medicines regulations and AMR surveillance. The scope of the work is immense and based on science. My deepest gratitude goes to the VMD for opening their doors for me to learn from them. I hope to make a difference in my country and in my \u201cOne Health\u201d career; using the lessons I learnt."
