This project supports the management of the 82,000ha of SSSI across the Defence estate."

This process helps to reduce competition from more aggressive and invasive plants, and maintains a high water table with periodic flooding in the dune slacks \u2013 low lying areas in the dune system which provide habitats for rare and specialist species."

Since 2019, the Sands of LIFE (SoLIFE) project, led by Natural Resources Wales, has been responsible for renewed scrub clearance to clear recolonising invasive species and control scrub along the area\u2019s boundary to allow the dune slacks to remain open."

In addition, the support of local volunteers including members of the BSBI has played a vital role. It\u2019s an exciting success story, and a great example of the long-term commitment needed to support nature recovery at wildlife sites throughout the UK."
