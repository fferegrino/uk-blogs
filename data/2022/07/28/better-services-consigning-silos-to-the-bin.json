Perhaps both are familiar. Perhaps you\u2019ve had both thoughts only a short time apart when working in the same policy area."

One minute I\u2019m seeing how hospitals run Accident and Emergency departments and the next how the Army recruits new soldiers. Different settings, but both have complex challenges to get right."

A bewildering number of things to arrange including transport, in-home physiotherapy, meal service, and follow-up GP appointments. All managed and provided by different organisations across central government, local government, healthcare and sometimes charity or private providers."

            "text": "It made me think about how policy worlds collide where people do the work, and in such unexpected ways. The simple task of getting GPs to provide medical history for people applying to join the Army, keeping applicants interested and moving them through the recruitment process, suddenly didn\u2019t seem so easy. Why and how should a GP prioritise dealing with a request for medical history over providing information to discharge a patient from hospital? That\u2019s on top of all the other considerations in their in-tray such as referrals from local opticians, dealing with practice recruitment, as well as seeing today\u2019s patients."

From climate change to employment, to social care and economic growth \u2013 our work repeatedly shows that it requires a whole host of people to work together. Getting it wrong is often most visible in social and health issues \u2013 whether that be integrated care systems or supporting vulnerable people. Inevitably, it\u2019s those that most need help that find themselves pulled in different and confusing directions by unintended policy consequences."

            "text": "In all these policy areas, individually good but misaligned intent can end up adversely impacting the people that government is trying to help. The result is disconnect between the purpose of policy areas and how parts of the system work together. Our own work shows that outcomes for people using services are the sum of the connections of the parts, rather than sum of the parts."

            "text": "There\u2019s no easy or single answer. Building shared purpose needs awareness of the alignment, or not, of objectives, funding, governance and accountability arrangements between the organisations involved. The last three of these are big influences on what people and organisations do. There is less chance of achieving a shared purpose if decisions on what work to invest in, and how we oversee and measure its progress, pulls the people and organisations involved in different directions."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s perhaps obvious, but start with that shared understanding of purpose, who contributes and how, as a foundation. If everyone gets \u2018why we\u2019re doing something\u2019 and can see how their part contributes, it\u2019s easier to have meaningful conversations about how to work together. That makes it easier to work out where to invest and, crucially, how to hold each other to account. Clarity on who contributes and how is a precondition for accountability for what happens next."

            "text": "Alignment doesn\u2019t mean people will agree on everything, but they do need to be able to raise and deal with issues in a conscious and informed way. A way that achieves a trade-off between individual organisation\u2019s policy objectives. That requires a true understanding of the lived experience of people impacted by the different policy areas. For example, the Department for Work and Pensions and the\u00a0Department for Education might compete to attract the same group of young people for apprenticeships and return-to-work programmes. So what does a change in one policy area really mean for mean for experience of the young person looking for work in Leeds, Dover, Truro or Penrith? And what\u2019s the likelihood of both departments achieving their objectives as a result of a policy change?"

            "text": "It\u2019s not easy, but worth the investment. Particularly as all systems adapt and change over time, often responding and evolving in ways you wouldn\u2019t predict. You need to need to be comfortable with that. It\u2019s unlikely there will be a clear linear path to success that\u2019s neatly laid out in front of you. You need to remain responsive to what you discover along the way."

And as our work on\u00a0Improving operational delivery in government\u00a0shows, there are many more practical challenges to making a difference to the lived experience of service users \u2013 which I\u2019ll return to in future blogposts."
