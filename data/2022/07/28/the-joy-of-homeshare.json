We know that loneliness, living alone and poor social connections are bad for your health, and many people are being priced out of towns and villages, when looking for an affordable place to live. The Homeshare UK team work with our network of providers to tackle these issues, whilst bringing joy to people's lives."

Florence, a 95-year-old householder is partially sighted, an RAF veteran, and used to be a keen tennis player. She has a homesharer called Alexandra. When Florence\u2019s husband died, she \u201cdesperately needed company\u201d. She was one of nine million adults in the UK who say they are often, or always, lonely. Homeshare is a way of supporting people to help each other."

It brings together people with a spare room with people who are happy to chat and lend a hand around the house in return for affordable, sociable accommodation."

For example, 96% of householders reported feeling less lonely since their homesharers moved in and 86% reported feeling happier. Householders feel safer and comforted with an overnight presence in the home and homesharers enjoy giving back to the local community (Homeshare UK, 2021, sector survey)."

            "text": "There can never be a state-driven solution to loneliness, which only personal relationships can remedy, however there are ways in which it can be beneficial to bring professional input to personal interactions. A unique advantage of Homeshare is the matching process, in which the Homeshare programme carefully vets, screens and assesses applicants for compatibility. Company is one thing, but good company is another."
