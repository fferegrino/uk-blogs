I started off as an alcohol caseworker which meant checking producers and retailers had the right licenses or that excise duty had been paid. I then moved across to oils, which is a pretty niche area in HMRC. I was out and about visiting oil refineries with full PPE hard hat and boots, or down long country lanes to a customer selling red diesel to farmers in the middle of nowhere! Each visit and customer were completely different to the last and each experience taught me new areas of tax.\u00a0\u00a0"

So, you must go out and find all those missing pieces until you have an idea of what is really going on. Sometimes, there is a genuine error that just needs a little nudge and other times there is something a bit more serious going on. The best part of the job though is the people. Meeting customers out and about, listening to their stories, watching them take pride in their businesses and helping them get it right gives you a great sense of job satisfaction. \u00a0"

In 2019, I attended the Women into Leadership event in London which opened a whole new world beyond HMRC that I did not even know existed. I met with women across the Civil Service \u2013 did you know the UK has a Space Agency?! Because I had no idea until I got chatting with the woman sat next to me! After the event, I got thinking about women in taxes and decided to get involved in my local Gender Network. In HMRC, they have staff networks for each of the protected characteristics which allow you to get involved in different areas. They group these into the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion space (or ED&I for short \u2013 told you they love acronyms!). \u00a0"

I still have days where I question my capability and that imposter syndrome sneaks back in, but then I sit back and look at what I have achieved in such a small amount of time and think about where else the civil service may take me.
