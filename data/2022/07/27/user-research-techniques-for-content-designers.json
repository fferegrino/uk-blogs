I hurriedly reached out on the government-wide Slack, a messaging platform, to talk to other user researchers who\u2019d done this before to understand where I could most add value."

This is great for finding out how users might navigate through a website. A good time to use a card sort is in the early stages, when you have an idea of the main content areas and want to see how users might group them."

            "text": "Tree testing often comes hand in hand. This helps you show users a basic text-only site structure without worrying about the design or layout. Tree testing has two main elements: a tree and tasks. You set users tasks to complete by looking for tasks using the site structure, clicking through your tree and nominating the information they think is correct."

        {
            "text": "As this article from experienceux explains, tree testing sessions usually last about 20 minutes, with 15 to 20 tasks per session. This is because users tend to lose concentration if the tasks go on for too long. By using this method to evaluate your site structure, you can measure how easy it is for users to find items."

            "text": "Highlighter testing is useful to do once content has been drafted. In person, it involves printing out some content and giving users each a green and red pen. They use these to highlight parts of the content that do and don\u2019t make sense to them. This is slightly more complicated to do virtually but can be done by screenshare or by sending users a doc ahead of time to highlight."

You can design tasks to see if users can find what they need and understand what to do as a result. It shows you how well your product or service works and helps to identify specific usability issues and insights."

It took some getting used to for me, as it felt so different from working on a transactional service with long term goals and specific roles. It\u2019s also challenging to stop doing research when there\u2019s always so much more you could do but time constraints don\u2019t allow."

I\u2019ve learned so much about GOV.UK guidance content, and the process from content being drafted to published, and how it\u2019s regularly improved after that. I love working at pace on short-term projects that help users find what they need. I also really enjoy trying to bridge the gap between user research and content design, sharing skills and learning between the two."
