It is a strong competitor against weeds, supports a wealth of native invertebrates and, looked after well can produce highly valuable timber."

Nurseries report that the situation for Quercus robur is the worst affected."

            "text": "Whilst this news is disappointing, it does gives project managers a chance to think differently about species choice. This could result in greater diversity in new woodlands as people select alternative replacement species to oak\u00a0 \u00a0These diverse woodlands can be more resilient to current and future threats if the species are site-adapted and, in turn, can deliver positive benefits for both wildlife and people."

            "text": "Oak trees and several other native species produce seed in natural cycles with bumper crops some years and nothing in others. These years of plenty are called \u2018mast years.\u2019 The process is not well understood but has been linked to various causes over the years, primarily weather and climatic conditions."

        {
            "text": "Unusually, this natural cycle coordinated over wide areas of Europe, perhaps due to a very wet spring last year (2021). This means a particularly poor supply of seed across much of Western Europe. Despite pulling out all the stops, nurseries have been unable to source all that they need."

        {
            "text": "Why can\u2019t we store oak seed for these poor years? Well, to be doubly awkward, storing oak seed is difficult and results in very poor germination rates, meaning that currently there is very little we can do to prevent years when supply is a problem."

In 2018, the UK government published the Tree Health Resilience Strategy in response to the increasing threat of pests and diseases impacting our woodlands. One of the key recommendations is that we should increase the species, genetic, and structural diversity of our woodlands."

It is important that the differences between the two native oaks is understood to select the best species of oak for a site, but this is likely to be a good option in terms of building in climate change resilience. \u00a0Speak to your local nursery to find out more."

The Ecological Site Classification Decision Support System (ESC-DSS) requires the input of soil moisture and nutrient information together with the site location. The software then compares a range of climate factors such as accumulated temperature and exposure. The results are presented on a scale of ecological suitability for the site for each of the main species used in the UK."
