The Bank Rate determines the interest rate the BoE pay to commercial banks that hold money with them. It therefore influences the rates those banks charge people to borrow money or pay on their savings."

            "text": "The news of this base rate increase comes amid rising inflation. The most recently released statistics show that the annual rate of the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has now risen to 9.4%. The CPI is the headline measure of inflation and is used by the government to set the BoE inflation target of 2%."

On the other hand, if inflation drops too low (or goes negative, which is called deflation), spending can be delayed as people expect prices to fall."
