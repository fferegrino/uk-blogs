Each of us has a somewhat different sense of place and a unique mental map of our own neighbourhood. However, neighbourhoods are ever-changing with demographic and socioeconomic shifts occurring across Great Britain (GB). These shifts contribute to the altering structure and spatial distribution of neighbourhoods, including changes in the demand and provision of housing, infrastructure and social services."

This framework was used to identify neighbourhoods in GB\u2019s largest cities that have increased their urban sustainability - green spaces, cycle lanes, solar-powered buildings, etc. - over the past 15 years, and to assess the socio-economic trajectory of different neighbourhoods across GB.\u00a0"

It can also generate empirical evidence and unveil how past urban planning interventions shaped the local built environment informing future planning strategies."
