This diversity is what makes the UK so rich in history, some of which was glorious and some dark.\u00a0"

The Welsh language was replaced by English, at least on official matters, and oral traditions that had survived centuries were lost. After centuries of banning the language and discriminating against its speakers, in 1967, a very important piece of legislation was introduced: the Welsh Language Act. It gave rights, albeit limited, that allowed people to use the Welsh language in legal proceedings in Wales.\u00a0"
