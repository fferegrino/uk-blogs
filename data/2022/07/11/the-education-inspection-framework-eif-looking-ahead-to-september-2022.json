For example, we have placed a clear expectation that conversations between leaders and the lead inspector will continue to include a discussion on the impact of COVID-19. This ensures that our inspections continue to be informed by the different contexts in which you work and the range of challenges that you may still face."

            "text": "We wanted to give you time to do this and so we put in place transitional arrangements.

            "text": "We initially envisaged that these arrangements would last until September 2020, by which time we would have expected providers to have their curriculum thinking in place. Of course, when national restrictions were put in place in response to the pandemic, everyone had to reprioritise their time. Some of you had to put your curriculum plans on hold and many of you had to develop new plans and find new ways of delivering your curriculum."

We therefore kept the transitional arrangements in place when we returned to full routine inspection in September 2021. This was to give you further time to make any additional changes that COVID-19 required."

            "text": "As we approach the start of another academic year, without national restrictions and modifications to our day-to-day work, now is the right time for us to move beyond the transitional arrangements. I am keen to stress that we are not introducing a \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for a judgement of good. We recognise that you are likely to always be revising elements of your curriculum. We will not suddenly expect you to meet every single criterion to remain good. Inspectors will continue to use the best-fit approach that is set out in the handbooks to reach a judgement of good."

Inspectors will want to be reassured that leaders can transfer the successful work underway in one area of the curriculum to other, less-developed aspects."

Inspection supports this approach to continuous improvement. Inspectors will therefore be interested in the effectiveness of leaders\u2019 actions and the steps being taken in subject areas that are less developed."

To reflect this, we will introduce a new grade descriptor in the quality of education judgement to formally acknowledge the longer-term impact that this will have. The following is the wording in the school inspection handbook, but similar changes have been made in the non-association independent school handbook and the further education and skills handbook:"

Where this is the case, these changes do not prevent all pupils having access to an appropriately broad and ambitious curriculum. Where adaptations to curriculum breadth are made for particular pupils, there is a clear rationale for why this is in those pupils\u2019 interests, and, where appropriate, there is a clear plan for returning all pupils to studying the full curriculum.\u2019"

For example, we have incorporated the annexes for specific settings into the main body of the handbooks, which makes them more user-friendly for you and our inspectors. We also want to be clearer about how we refer to different types of inspection. Section 5 inspections will now be referred to as \u2018graded\u2019 inspections and section 8 inspections of good and outstanding schools will be \u2018ungraded\u2019 inspections. Section 8 inspections include a range of different inspection types, and we are introducing this term to distinguish a particular type. The inspections themselves have not changed; the way that we refer to them simply supports a better understanding of the types of inspection that we carry out and why."

Annex A, which was previously a stand-alone annex in the handbook, is included in this new \u2018part\u2019."

Everyone did the best that they could in very difficult circumstances and, on behalf of Ofsted, I want to thank you all. I also want to reassure you that we recognise that some of these changes will continue to be relevant. I hope our updated handbooks reflect this."
