Our combined skills mean we use intelligence to direct our site visits to root out companies we identify who are likely to be breaking the rules and exporting waste abroad that they shouldn\u2019t be."

There are many other types of waste but so far, these are the main ones I see. The majority of these waste types are shipped under Green list waste controls also known as Article 18 waste controls, which are simplified controls for non-hazardous materials."

            "text": "These are allowed for export, but not in mixed loads. Issues arise when the bales and bags are contaminated with other waste types, for example plastic waste mixed with non-plastic. The requirement is that the bales should be \u201calmost free from\u201d other waste materials. This means they can be recycled and re-used, but if they\u2019re contaminated, the load is useless to the receiving country and presents them with an environmental and human health problem they don\u2019t need."

If it\u2019s showing signs of contamination, I inform my office colleagues who then issue a stop notice that prevents it from being exported."

But we have a way to check, so there is no hiding. Working with Border Force, I can get containers x-rayed, which reveals what\u2019s really inside. Often, I find other waste types concealed inside, like rubber, wood and nappies. Sometimes we find hidden cars! These illegal loads aren\u2019t going anywhere except to a correctly permitted site or our evidencing facility on port for further investigation."
