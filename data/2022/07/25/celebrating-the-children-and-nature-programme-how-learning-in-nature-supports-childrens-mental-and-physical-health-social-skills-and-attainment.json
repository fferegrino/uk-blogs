Having 30 primary school children present did cause some extra complications, but hearing children giggle while holding woodlice, seeing their delight as they used trigonometry in real-life to work out how tall trees were, and yes, roll down a slope, brought a lot to the day with many people reminiscing about how important outside spaces were in their own childhood for both learning and play."

            "text": "There is a wealth of evidence showing that children who spend time outside connecting with nature experience better mental and physical health and improved wellbeing. The 25 Year environment plan recognised this and included a policy commitment encouraging children to be close to nature, in and out of school; providing the framework for the Children and Nature Programme that Natural England has been leading on behalf of Defra and Department for Education (DfE). It was developed as three projects: Nature Friendly Schools, Community Forest and Woodland Outreach Project and Growing Care Farming."

That\u2019s why I\u2019m so delighted that Natural England and its partners have championed and delivered the Children and Nature Programme.\""

Care farms, which offer people with defined health, social or educational needs the chance to participate in a variety of farming activities for therapeutic benefit, have increased the number of places each year to over 675,000 (a 54 per cent increase). This scale of delivery despite the challenges of Covid has proved transformational for the participating schools, teachers and students. One teacher reported delightedly that \u201cChildren\u2019s eyes lit up and giggles of excitement filled the air as pupils watched nature in their own school grounds.\u201d"
