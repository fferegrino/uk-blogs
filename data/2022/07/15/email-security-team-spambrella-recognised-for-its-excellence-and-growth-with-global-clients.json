It will soon become apparent if the facts are in-line. Additionally, it is important to have a story, remember this is an award for 'Enterprise' so do not be put off if you do not have \u00a3100M annually in revenues. It is good to share your struggles, successes - the judges are real people, and you want them to feel the passion and pride you have for your company.\u00a0"
