Where our facilities are automatically checked for corrosion or degradation. Where every photo we take is checked and given a security marking dependant on its content."

Which is why workshops like the one we attended are so important. Hearing what\u2019s on offer and working with partners is vital as we figure out how we can bring AI into nuclear applications."
