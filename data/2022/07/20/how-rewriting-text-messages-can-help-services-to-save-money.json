            "text": "For public sector services, text messages are a cost-effective way to speak to people. They\u2019re cheaper than letters and, if they\u2019re well written, they can be more engaging than emails."

            "text": "The cost of sending a text message depends on how long it is. Anything over 160 characters counts as more than one message. This gives us a simple - if simplistic - way to measure if a text message provides good value for money."
        },
        {
            "text": "For example, if you cut 1 character from a 460-character message, you reduce the cost of sending it by a quarter. Small changes like this could help a service to make substantial economic savings. They might even be able to use Notify for free under our current pricing model."

Due to the situation regarding COVID-19, the Children, Young People and Family Centres are not able to offer their Bumps to Babies antenatal courses at the moment.
