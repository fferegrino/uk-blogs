We know that social care has been delivering delegated healthcare interventions for some years. We\u2019ve seen an increase in these interventions, with clear benefits for people who draw on services, as well as a recognition of the value, skills and complexity of care across health and social care settings."

        },
        {
            "text": "These include blood pressure monitoring, insulin administration, catheter care, wound care and more. We have seen some great examples of good practice, where this process has worked well, but the delegation picture across the country is varied, with differing local protocols, structures and processes in place."
        },
        {
            "text": "With this in mind, there\u2019s a need to develop a national voluntary framework to support safe and effective delegation across residential and community settings. This will also include the personal assistant (PA) workforce. We want to support the delegation that is already taking place, with the oversight and accountability of a registered health professional. We are clear this accountability will not change under the new framework."

            "text": "This approach means we can maximise the benefits to people who draw on services, and their families, so we can secure their peace of mind for effective and safe delivery of person-centred and consistent care. It is also a recognition of the good practice already happening before the pandemic but which became accelerated during the crisis."

It will set out clear guiding principles informed by policy, procedure, governance arrangements. The research conducted last year has fed into this work."
