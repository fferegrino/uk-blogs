Our goal is to use data to get valuable and timely insights. We support this by ensuring that all colleagues have opportunities to develop their data capability and be ambitious about future ways of working with data. One of the ways our Data Infrastructure team support colleagues to do this is by running \u2018Data Workspace bootcamps\u2019.\u202f\u00a0"

It contains over 800 datasets and over a dozen analysis tools that anyone with up-to-date security training can use. Hundreds of people in the department already use it to search for and analyse data. However, bootcamps provide an opportunity to show other DIT colleagues how they can use it and help them gain the skills to do so.\u202f\u00a0"

            "text": "Designing this course was challenging because of the sheer amount of subject-matter we could have covered. The platform itself has a lot of datasets and functionality to explore. Most importantly, we wanted colleagues to be able to use our visualisation tool Amazon Web Services (AWS) QuickSight, and to manipulate and summarise data with Structured Query Language (SQL). By prioritising user needs, we ultimately reduced this to 5 weeks\u2019 worth of learning objectives and built the content around those. This was further refined using feedback from the attendees of our pilot sessions and by trialling changes in smaller training sessions for individual teams. Thank you to everyone who acted as guinea pigs!\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

Before each bootcamp series, colleagues are given access to all datasets needed during the sessions. We can then introduce new concepts, provide demonstrations and give attendees time to experiment with them during the session. In response to recent feedback, we are adding quizzes to each session to enable more interactivity. We are also creating optional \u2018homework\u2019 to give attendees an opportunity to reflect on the training throughout the week when they have capacity.\u00a0"

The feedback from attendees has been overwhelmingly positive. 100% of Bootcamp attendees feel confident building dashboards in QuickSight, and 70% of attendees feel confident finding and using data from Data Workspace. Attendees reported that they found it \u2018really helpful\u2019 and that it gave a \u2018solid understanding around the basic of QuickSight and linking SQL\u2019.
