To mark the start of this year\u2019s campaign, the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) will share their annual Fatal Injuries in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing in GB report 2021/22 on 18 July. Yellow Wellies will use these figures to reflect on what\u2019s been achieved over the past decade and highlight how much there is still to do to improve the safety record of our industry."
