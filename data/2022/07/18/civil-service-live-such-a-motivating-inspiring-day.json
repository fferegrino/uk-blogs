Through June and July, CSL spanned five cities, six dates and welcomed more than 15,000 delegates through its doors, but what did you think of it? We found out!\u00a0"

The talk with Chief Operating Officer Alex Chisholm on funding and finance had a real focus and purpose, along with reinforcement that we\u2019re doing a fantastic job. There\u2019s a real range of jobs in the Civil Service but it takes a bit of everything to make it work. I signed up to the Civil Service Languages Network. For anyone who hasn\u2019t been, you should attend [next year]. There\u2019s real variety for everyone to get involved - and you can\u2019t help but take some sort of learning away."

A lot of people came up to the stall and said, \u201cI speak Japanese,\u201d or \u201cI speak Mandarin\u2019 to a really high level.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything about them, yet the government could make great use of them. Linguists are very valuable people!\u00a0"

It was packed with tips on engaging your audience and if you hit a lull, just turn it on the audience and ask, \u2018What have you learned?\u2019 or \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 and take two minutes to discuss this.

In previous departments, I\u2019d always seen CSL advertised but never taken time out of my working day - yet you get so much out of it. I\u2019ve met civil servants across different departments and found out what they do. A lot of the volunteers on my stand had loads of experience so I learned about my own department. It\u2019s a good day out!"

We talked to civil servants across government to demystify what COBR [Cabinet Office Briefing Room] is, running through the principles of crisis management and exploring examples where we may - or may not - activate a COBR meeting. We\u2019re trying to lift the lid a bit and had a really positive response with great feedback. It\u2019s an awful lot to cover and a real whistle-stop tour about the very high-level principles of crisis management, when in reality, the devil is in the detail. Feedback told us it\u2019s a really useful way of demonstrating how valuable it is, and the role every civil servant might have to play."

Even though I\u2019ve been in the Civil Service 20 years, I still feel I have a leadership career within me. I asked the panel what advice they\u2019d give my daughter and they said, there\u2019ll always be a good career in the Civil Service with lots to do and good prospects."
