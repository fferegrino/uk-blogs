            "text": "We recently commissioned Teacher Tapp to carry out a survey of teachers in order to find out what they think about a variety of topics. We already ask headteachers about their experiences of inspection through our post-inspection surveys, but we wanted to reach classroom teachers too, and home in on a few specific questions. Teachers have been through a period of massive upheaval, and we wanted to see what has become more and less important as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "text": "Fifty-three per cent of respondents told Teacher Tapp that their school had made changes following its most recent inspection. Obviously, we\u2019re keen to know what these changes are, so we are piloting a post-inspection, follow-up survey later in the year. This will ask leaders whose schools were inspected in autumn 2021 about any changes they have made in their schools as a result of their inspection. The usual post-inspection survey (sent to schools with their final inspection report) captures leaders\u2019 immediate intent for change; it\u2019ll be interesting to see how this is going approximately 2 terms later."

            "text": "We are glad to see that over half of the teachers who responded said that their schools used their inspection to generate impetus for change. This is particularly positive because most schools are judged to be good or outstanding, but are being inspired by discussions during inspections, and by inspection reports, to continually improve rather than rest on their laurels."

Furthermore, over half of the respondents who teach in requires improvement or inadequate schools agreed. Given that judgement can be tough to take, this is an encouraging figure. However, the 8 out of 10 who agreed is less than the 9 out of 10 of respondents who agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, \u2018The judgements made by inspectors were justified based on the evidence collected\u2019 in the latest post-inspection survey."

Half of those who had read the research reported that they had made changes to their teaching as a result. This is a huge reach and impact, given that there are around half a million teachers in England."

            "text": "Seniority did have a strong impact on whether teachers had read Ofsted\u2019s research in the last 12 months. Forty-two per cent of classroom teachers reported reading Ofsted\u2019s research in that time frame, with this increasing to 60% of middle leaders, 77% of senior leaders and 80% of headteachers. The proportion of teachers who said they had made changes following reading Ofsted\u2019s research also increased with seniority."

With everything else that is going on in schools, that\u2019s a testament both to the value of our research and to the dedication, commitment and willingness to go the extra mile shown by the teaching profession."
