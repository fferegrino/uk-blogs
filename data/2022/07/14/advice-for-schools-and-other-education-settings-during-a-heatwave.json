Children should wear loose, light-coloured clothing to help keep cool and sunhats with wide brims and should stay in the shade as much as possible. Sunscreen should be used to protect skin and children should be provided with plenty of water."

Windows should be closed when the outdoor air becomes warmer than the air indoors \u2013 this should help keep the heat out while allowing adequate ventilation. Indoor blinds or curtains can be closed where possible but should not block ventilation."

Oscillating mechanical fans can be used to increase air movement if temperatures are below 35\u00b0C \u2013 at temperatures above 35\u00b0C fans may not prevent heat-related illness and may worsen dehydration."
