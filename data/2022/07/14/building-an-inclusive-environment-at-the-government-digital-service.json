We do that by running major services like GOV.UK, and by building digital products that underpin digital services built by other parts of government. To achieve this, it is vital that our teams reflect the rich diversity of the society we serve. Having diverse teams with alternative perspectives means we\u2019re less likely to fall into group-think or miss important inclusivity considerations. It\u2019s not a \u201cnice to have\u201d, it needs to be part of our DNA."

We call this \u201cOne Login for Government\u201d. Proving your identity is a hugely complex topic, and we have to be constantly thinking of how our design would work or feel to different groups."

People will be able to prove they are who they say they are by answering \u201cknowledge-based verification\u201d questions. This needs to work for people with a mortgage and a credit card, but also for someone who has just left prison and doesn\u2019t have much in the way of a digital credit history."
