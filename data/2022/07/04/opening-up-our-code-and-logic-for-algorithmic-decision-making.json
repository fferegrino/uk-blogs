Many pages on GOV.UK include a \u201cRelated content\u201d box that suggests other pages that the user may be interested in. The editor of a page is able to manually specify what content is suggested on it, but by default that content is automatically generated by our related content recommender, which is based on the node2vec algorithm."

It has helped us reflect upon the approach and clarify assumptions. It also helped us spell out the decision-making process that the tool follows, and justify its use."
