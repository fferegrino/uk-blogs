The vetting process will identify all unspent convictions, and any attempt to withhold convictions will be looked on unfavourably and can cause job offers to be retracted. If the candidate cannot remember all convictions, they can either request a copy of their record from the Police National database, or explain on the vetting forms that they have listed as many convictions as they can recall but others may be shown. Disclosure calculators available at MoJ website and Unlock website can help in working out which convictions need to be disclosed."
