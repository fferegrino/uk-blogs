Our User Centred Design (UCD) mission is to \u201cexplore and champion the needs of our users, helping DIT design services that maximise successful international trade\u201d. User research is at the heart of this."

            "text": "We\u2019re really curious about how we can develop our practice to increase our impact. In lots of settings, user researchers see things being built that may not pay enough attention to user insights and not fully meet user needs. Yet when we raise this, we are sometimes told that we are slowing things down and being a blocker. "

            "text": "However, can we adapt how we play our role to increase our influence? DIT is highly delivery focused: all our stakeholders, from Ministers down, are ambitious for us to build the services that help exporters and investors. This means the pressure on our teams to deliver at pace is considerable. If, as user researchers, we are always saying, \u201chold on, wait for the research\u201d, the risk is that our voice gets marginalised.\u00a0"

To meet service standards, we need to make sure our teams hear and take the user voice into account as we design and build services. Beyond that, how do we reflect on our own practice and innovate to be as responsive as possible to the delivery pressures the department faces?\u00a0"

            "text": "This raises some important questions for how we do user research. For instance, do we always get the balance right between focusing on the biggest risks versus understanding the whole system?\u00a0 Where do we draw the line between the \u201cideal\u201d research design, and doing \u201cjust enough research\u201d to help the team make their next decision? How do we create a culture of continuous discovery, rather than seeing discovery as a gate we have to get through before starting to prototype?\u00a0"

            "text": "By getting questions like this right, it helps us build decisions a little quicker, ensuring that teams deliver at the pace the department needs. So, this helps make sure the user research we do has the impact we want. \u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "This also relates to a broader ongoing debate about how service teams retain agility and flexibility. Voices such as Tom Loosemore and Richard Pope, key players in establishing the Government Digital Service (GDS) and the service standard, are waving cautionary flags. Their concern is that the formal discovery-alpha-beta-live design process is starting to look dated and risks becoming a straight-jacket. See Tom\u2019s post on Twitter and Richard\u2019s post on Twitter as examples. As user researchers, how should we be responding to this challenge? With DIT\u2019s enterprising \u201cwillingness to innovate\u201d, we are keen to find people who want to be part of working this out.\u00a0"
