Companies House intends to launch the Register of Overseas Entities on 1 August 2022. A link to the service will be shared with those subscribed to the Companies House newsletter once it\u2019s gone live. It is planned that the land registration elements of the Act will come into force on\u00a05 September 2022. This will allow time for those currently engaged in a relevant land transaction to comply with the requirement to register with Companies House and obtain an Overseas Entity ID (OE ID) number before making an application to the relevant land registry."

Once registered, Companies House will issue the overseas entity with an OE ID. More information on this can be found in this joint blog."

Once the Act commences, they may need to apply promptly to Companies House in time so they can still apply for land registration within their priority search period. We must reject a land registration application if an overseas entity is needed but has not been provided."

In particular, anyone who successfully applies to register a transfer, lease or charge from an overseas entity that owned land when the Act commenced will not be prevented from registering the disposition by a restriction on disposition if they make their application within the first six months of the Act taking effect."
