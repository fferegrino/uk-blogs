            "text": "Most civil servants publish content on GOV.UK using a tool called Whitehall - a bespoke content management system. Publishers will only put something live once it has gone through various checks and reviews to make sure all content on GOV.UK is accurate and formatted correctly."

        {
            "text": "This review process often leads to people who aren\u2019t publishers needing to see a draft of the content before publication. However, only people who regularly publish on GOV.UK have access to publishing tools like Whitehall. This could lead to frustrations when sharing drafts with workarounds including taking and sharing screenshots, which all took time and effort."

            "text": "For pages with lots of linked attachments, for example: COVID-19 Response: Autumn and Winter Plan 2021, this adds time and effort to the publishing journey and makes it harder for people without access to publishing tools to preview draft content."

In the last 6 months, we\u2019ve had more than 2,000 active publishers who have edited more than 100,000 pages in Whitehall. We estimate that more than 75% of that involves a review of the draft content on GOV.UK, probably multiple times by multiple people."

            "text": "Our approach is based upon the JSON Web Token web standard. We generate a random value in our publishing tool, the auth-bypass-id, and we use this to create a cryptographically-signed token which can be used as a query parameter for the URL. The use of cryptography prevents a user from being able to guess a document's auth-bypass-id."

        {
            "text": "When a publisher wants to share this draft content with someone, they can use the \u2018shareable preview\u2019 link. This is made up of the normal link to the content on our draft site, and a query parameter containing a \u2018token\u2019. This token contains some data (including the auth-bypass-id) securely encoded as a JSON web token."
        },
        {
            "text": "This means that when a reviewer accesses the content via the shareable preview link, their token is decoded and the auth-bypass-id contained within it is compared to the auth-bypass-id stored on the edition. If it matches, great! The reviewer can see the draft content, as it would appear on the website, without needing to log in to anything. If it doesn\u2019t match, they will not be able to see the draft, but will be asked to log into the publishing tools."

            "text": "This link can be shared with anyone who needs to preview the draft content as it will appear on GOV.UK. After the content is published on GOV.UK, the shareable document preview link will no longer work. If a publisher creates a new edition of their content, they can get a new shareable document preview link."
        },
        {
            "text": "The shareable preview links are very secure. Publishers are told in the publishing tool when they copy a link that anybody with the link can view it and that they are responsible for who they share draft documents with."

        {
            "text": "If the link is shared with someone it should not be shared with or if they no longer want to share the preview of a draft, publishers will be able to generate a new shareable document preview link. This means the previous link will no longer be valid and they\u2019ll need to reshare the link if needed."
