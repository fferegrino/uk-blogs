These technologies have continued to have a significant impact on our new work environment, and include monitoring the office environment, such as desk usage, communal space utilisation, room occupancy and CO2 levels."

Whilst the VR explorations, such as VR meeting solutions and VR flood modelling, were useful to explore the technology, we feel there is some way to go in the evolution of the VR products. Our explorations showed that the products are bulky and not suitable for prolonged use."

Hyper automation exploits multiple technologies, tools, and platforms to further automate processes. This is in support of the UK government\u2019s clear ambition to create a leaner, more efficient, more innovative civil service, where digital automation technologies will be key."

Moving beyond digital to virtual increased the need for both automation and social/collaborative tools. Intelligent induction and Learning Experience Platform technologies can support our onboarding processes, such as administration and engagement initiatives, and contribute to staff retention and morale."
