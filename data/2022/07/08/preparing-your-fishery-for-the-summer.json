It\u2019s vital that anglers and fishery managers recognise the risks posed by warmer weather; remain vigilant for signs of fish in distress and take time to prepare. A little extra care can go a long way."

Stress can be caused by many things: poor nutrition, poor water quality, fishing pressure, lack of habitat, overcrowding - even the weather!"

            "text": "Fish diseases and parasites are a natural part of any freshwater environment. They play an important role in keeping fish populations healthy by removing weak, old or vulnerable fish and allowing fitter individuals to take their place. In healthy fisheries, fish and fish diseases exist in a balance; but if that balance changes, disease can be a real concern."

        {
            "text": "Many diseases and parasites need certain temperatures to become \u2018active\u2019. Koi Herpesvirus is a well-known example of a warm weather disease that can have huge impacts on carp fisheries; but there are others. Outbreaks rarely occur simply due to the presence of a pathogen, with many problems starting when fish are stressed, damaged, or exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Knowing what can trigger disease outbreaks is key to understanding how they can be avoided."
