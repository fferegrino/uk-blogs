It has been heart-breaking to watch some of the scenes from Ukraine, and it really struck me the efforts that owners are going to for their pets. Their pets are treated as an equally important member of their family, often travelling hundreds of miles to the border, with the option of leaving them behind unthinkable. We have also seen an amazing response from surrounding countries who have opened their borders, not only to the Ukrainian people, but also to their pets."

My daughter spent many hours playing with our cats; and I know for many people, particularly those who live on their own, their pets were their only form of companionship for a prolonged period of time."

Where once I was not aware of things in common with colleagues, when we suddenly noticed a dog in the background, or heard a bark or a cat wander in front of the camera, this suddenly opened up a new topic of conversation and highlighted something that brought us closer."

I then spent many years working at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, focusing on pharmacovigilance (the science focussing on understanding and preventing adverse effects of medicines or vaccines); where approximately 80% of all adverse event reports involve dogs and cats."

I always enjoyed approaching things from a big picture perspective so moving my career into surveillance and epidemiology seemed the perfect fit. Since leaving clinical practice I have been able to make a difference at a population level, and by working in different areas of government, I have been able to influence policy decisions based on my veterinary knowledge."
