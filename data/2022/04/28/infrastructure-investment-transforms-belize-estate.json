I\u2019ve been in post three years, and this is my last appointment in the Regular Army \u2013 all good things come to an end eventually! Before I leave, I wanted to share some of the magnificent work that has been completed in Belize to invest in, develop and improve our infrastructure."

The term Land Regional Hub means that Belize has been earmarked as one of several permanent bases that will receive investment to ensure it can support a sustained military presence."

The LIIF has delivered a new HQ ATAP to brief families as they arrive in Belize and to act as a rest area for HQ military staff, a boat launching area to provide a proper boat launching pad for BATSUB boats in support of exercises and recreational activities, mess improvements and enhancements to the waiting room and other areas within the BDF hospital."

The joint work by personnel on Exercise SAILFISH, DIO staff and the Army has been fantastic. They have done themselves proud and they have transformed the BATSUB estate so it is ready to meet the challenges of becoming a Land Regional Hub."
