You are concerned that more pupils are behind with reading on entry to secondary school. In this blog post, I explain how inspectors evaluate support for weaker readers. Although it relates to pupils in secondary schools who have fallen behind with reading, it is also relevant for pupils of any age who need to catch up with reading."

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more pupils not reading well enough for their age. Our autumn 2021 education recovery in schools report\u00a0told us that many secondary schools are having to focus more on helping pupils to catch up in reading. For example, some were targeting key stage 3 pupils who had been identified as needing additional phonics work. Others had introduced new reading programmes for whole cohorts, such as Year 7."

Pupils who struggle to read words accurately quickly fall behind their peers. They read less and do not accumulate the necessary background knowledge and vocabulary from reading. To fulfil the demands of the secondary school curriculum, pupils need to be able to read age-appropriate texts fluently. Pupils who cannot read well are not able to access the curriculum and are disadvantaged for life."

            "text": "Pupils who are struggling with reading need help. Comprehension suffers when pupils cannot read words accurately and fluently. Pupils who are struggling to read the words on a page find that their working memory is overloaded. They can\u2019t make sense of what they read, can\u2019t recall previous content, and so fall behind in any subject that requires reading."

            "text": "So, it\u2019s important that assessment checks exactly which aspect(s) of reading that pupils are struggling with \u2013 whether weaker readers are having difficulty reading words accurately and/or automatically. This makes sure that you can target extra support effectively. For example, pupils who can\u2019t read unfamiliar words accurately will need phonics teaching. Regardless of age, special educational need or background, the same knowledge of the alphabetic code and phonics skills underpins all reading. Intensive practice should soon make sure that pupils can read age-appropriate texts accurately and automatically."
        },
        {
            "text": "Pupils\u2019 understanding of language can still be developed while they get extra help with phonics. Age-appropriate texts should be read to them so that they can benefit from discussions and broaden their understanding of the vocabulary and concepts that the texts contain. This way, when their word reading catches up, they will have the understanding of language needed to comprehend what they read. It is also why it is so important to get phonics sorted quickly \u2013 so that pupils can read and gain knowledge for themselves."
