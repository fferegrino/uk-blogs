I decided to sign up for the peer-to-peer groups to support my own wellbeing; I\u2019m passionate about positive mental health for everyone in the school community - from the pupils to every member of staff. It felt important to lead by example, making sure I was looking after my own wellbeing, as well as my team\u2019s."

We talked to each other, shared the challenges we were facing in our schools and the impact this was having on us personally and professionally. There was a real feeling of solidarity as many of us could relate to each other\u2019s concerns and feelings."

I could address how I was really feeling and the impact of things at work. \u00a0There was a real sense of belonging in the group - it became a headteacher staffroom. I was able to focus on my own wellbeing using the strategies I\u2019d learned, which helped me to manage my mental health at home and work. It had a positive effect on all areas of my life."

They give leaders a way to prioritise their own mental health and wellbeing, so they can be as happy and well as possible. You can also share the strategies and support with your teams and pupils to support everyone in your school community."
