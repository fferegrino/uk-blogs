However, since then, we have demonstrated change is achievable with a 91% decrease in the use of physical interventions, a 92% decrease in the use of suspensions, and significantly improved academic outcomes."

We changed our focus to ensure we understood the underlying needs of children."

We introduced a four-stage arrival routine with welcome teams, breakfast teams and keyworker sessions in the morning before timetabled lessons, supporting everyone to \u201ccome in to land\u201d and start the school day as gently as possible. This simultaneously has allowed us to identify issues and work through them together so that they do not impact negatively upon the day."

We invested in PSHRE and Careers Guidance through training so we could deliver this \u2018in-house\u2019, thus reducing barriers to accessing support."
