            "text": "On 22 April, the Environment Agency\u2019s consultation on the next round of river basin management plans (RBMPs) closes. The plans, delivered on behalf of the Environment Secretary, are important because they set local objectives for our shared water environment, help secure investment, set conditions in environmental permits and enable sustainable growth. So, it\u2019s fair to say that, as the challenges facing water are increasing in the face of climate change, population growth and urbanisation, they are a pretty big deal to the Environment Agency and our partners."

            "text": "So, what do RBMPs actually do? Put simply, they pull together all the evidence about water in what we refer to as \u2018river basin districts\u2019 \u2013 that is, areas of the country joined together by rivers (this map shows where they are) and how organisations, stakeholders and communities will work together to improve them. For water bodies to be classed as \u2018good\u2019 under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) they must meet standards in a range of areas such as pollution, the numbers of fish and other aquatic life, and groundwater quantity. The plans are like a business case that sets out how much money is needed, who is responsible for the actions, how all the work will be done, and by who."

So, they are a really important process to help meet this goal and summarise billions of pounds of investment to 2027."

            "text": "Waters are not in the condition we want. They are no longer improving. Only 14% of them currently meet the criteria for good ecological status under WFD, and that number has stayed stubbornly the same for several years. We are still seeing too much pollution from sewage, farming, industry and road-run off. Meanwhile new threats are seeping into waters, including microplastics and so-called forever chemicals.\u00a0\u00a0We do know, though, that rivers have improved in some aspects because there are other ways we can measure their health aside from the overall categories set out in the WFD."

Under the \u2018one out, all out\u2019 requirement of the WFD it is difficult to show where things are progressing, as this isn\u2019t always reflected in overall changes in good ecological status. Good ecological status results don\u2019t tell the whole story of rivers."

We have made good progress in protecting and enhancing water over the last couple of decades, but we still have a long way to go. Getting to lasting solutions will take decades, but we know what the problems are, and we know how to address most of them. Those are good foundations on which to build. But if we really want to shift the dial then we will also need to think and act differently, and everyone needs to play their part.\u00a0\u00a0It is crucial that all those who use, rely on and are responsible for water take part in these consultations to help us take forward the right actions together to and help deliver the improvements we all need."
