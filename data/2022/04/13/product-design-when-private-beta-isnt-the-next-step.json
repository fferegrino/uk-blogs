But what emerged very quickly was that citizens didn\u2019t see it chunked up that way. They saw it all as their \u2018PIP application\u2019. They didn\u2019t want to start a new process. Our user research was telling us we needed to build the mandatory reconsiderations process onto the existing service."

It felt more like we were trying to squeeze into a space that was rapidly changing size and shape.
