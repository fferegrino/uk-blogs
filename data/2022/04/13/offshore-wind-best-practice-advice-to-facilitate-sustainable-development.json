It is therefore essential that there is clear advice regarding the use of data and evidence to support offshore wind development and enable smoother consenting decisions."

These provide advice for baseline characterisation surveys of ecological receptors, pre-application engagement, data and evidence expectations at the application stage and post-consent monitoring plans. Minor updates have been made to Phases I, II and III for the purposes of consistency and cross-document referencing."
