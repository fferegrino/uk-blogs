Thankfully though, in\u00a0January 2021 we found a disused irrigation pond and transformed it into something anglers could fish from. I funded this myself and it was developed specifically with young anglers in mind. We then went on to receive a grant from the\u00a0Environment\u00a0Agency and donations from local businesses to complete the project in time for our proposed first children\u2019s\u00a0fishing event, in Spring 2022."

As well as the grant, we were also lucky enough to receive some crucians and tench stock from the Environment Agency\u2019s fish farm at Calverton. These lovely fish will thrive in the more diverse\u00a0depths of\u00a0our new pond, which will allow us to hold coaching sessions for more challenging techniques in deeper water and longer distances."

            "text": "It's fantastic to see how far the young anglers have come in Leiston in just the two seasons\u00a0I\u2019ve been involved. We pride ourselves on our conservation work and commitment to diversity and inclusion and are proud to have a higher-than-average percentage of young girls, elderly, and disabled anglers.\u00a0It's particularly rewarding to see how much our anglers living with a disability love fishing and come out of their shells when taking part. Just looking at the\u00a0children\u2019s and parents faces at our end of season\u00a0presentation\u00a0event makes all the hard work totally worthwhile."

            "text": "If I could give any advice to young people, or their parents, who are wondering whether to take up fishing it would be to try something new. There is so much more to immerse\u00a0yourself in, we are often treated to some true spectacles of nature that the non-angler might not see, such as kingfishers, Dragon Flies, Deer etc."
