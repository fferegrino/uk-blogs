This is by design but given that most of us rarely look past the top results, it also raises an important question: how does the website (or the underlying algorithm) decide which products to present first? Do they rank the products by customer ratings, relevance, price, commission paid by the seller, or something else?"

These types of scarcity claims can provide helpful information, but they can also make you feel like you need to decide quickly \u2013 which is particularly concerning when such claims can be misleading or even untrue."

You then realise that the final price has gone up by \u00a35 due to compulsory charges for the additional toothbrush head that were not mentioned earlier. As we tend to focus on upfront prices, this type of drip pricing can make it difficult to compare between offers or reduce our willingness to go back and search for an alternative once we are at the checkout."

There is good evidence that such OCA practices, individually or in combination, can affect the decisions you make. Competition and consumer authorities can play a crucial role in understanding how the effects of OCA may be harmful to consumers, and taking action to help."

These include our consumer case work (such as our investigations into the online hotel booking and car rental intermediaries markets) and digital market studies (such as those relating to digital advertising and mobile ecosystems). OCA will remain relevant across a wide range of digital contexts the CMA and any future Digital Markets Unit will look at.
