Combined, our two organisations are the largest landowners in Yorkshire, and we have a responsibility to look after this countryside and protect our downstream communities which are at risk of flooding."

At Gorpley Reservoir near Todmorden, a Yorkshire Water site, around 112,000 broad leaf trees were planted in 2020. These trees, planted by contractors and volunteers on behalf of the Woodland Trust, were just one part of the project."

            "text": "We also focused on other natural flood management techniques, including stabilising banks, creating new ponds and building leaky dams. We also trialled techniques to retore and stabilise peat soils, such as peat bunds and reprofiling, vegetation management and planting thousands of sphagnum moss plugs. All these measures, together with the new trees, will help to slow the flow of water across our land, reduce peat erosion and capture carbon."

            "text": "Looking at Gorpley Reservoir now, it\u2019s exciting to imagine the woodland it will one day become. The scale of the work is impressive, with trees stretching across the valley. So far, the trees have established well, especially in the lower half of the site. As they grow, their roots will hold increasingly more water, slowing the flow in the catchment."

            "text": "Bank stabilisation has already led to increased vegetation cover, and wildlife surveys have recorded an increase in amphibians and invertebrates in and around the new ponds. The University of Leeds have been monitoring run-off and water levels at the site, and this will give us useful data to analyse the effect on flood risk."

Working closely with Yorkshire Water and the Woodland Trust, the National Trust are delivering part of the White Rose Forest\u2019s Lanscapes For Water project \u2013 focusing on the Upper Calder catchment. The ambition is to create clough woodland across five different upland sites in the South Pennines. Although still in the early stages of development, this will also have a direct benefit on reducing flood risk."

Surveys have revealed tree stumps hidden below the peat which are thousands of years old. Whilst we don\u2019t necessarily want to restore these landscapes to prehistoric conditions, we can learn from these archaeological records to create new areas of woodland that are sensitive to the historic environment."

            "text": "When planting trees on sensitive areas such as SPAs (Special Protection Area and SACs (Special Area of Conservation, it\u2019s crucial that we understand our landscape and the impacts our proposals will have as fully as possible. This involves undertaking detailed survey work including peat surveys, breeding bird surveys, archaeological studies and vegetation surveys. Picking the right species of tree is key too; we see naturally self-seeding rowan and birch on some parts of the moors, but also unsuitable species like pine and invasive non-native rhododendron."

Our next step will involve any necessary surveys and then identifying areas that would benefit from clough woodlands and moorland restoration techniques."
