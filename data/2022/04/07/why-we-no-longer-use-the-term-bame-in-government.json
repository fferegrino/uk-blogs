In its report, published on 31 March 2021, the Commission found that aggregate terms like \u2018BAME\u2019 (black, Asian and minority ethnic) were no longer helpful and should be dropped, advocating instead a focus on understanding disparities and outcomes for specific ethnic groups."

This sets out a ground-breaking action plan intended to tackle negative disparities, promote unity and build a fairer Britain for all. It also includes a commitment to no longer use the term \u2018BAME\u2019 in government.\u00a0"

This was updated in December last year and recommends that, wherever possible, we should use the specific ethnic classifications of the Census.

This followed research by the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity which found a lack of trust around the term, with some arguing that it allowed organisations to \u201caverage out\u201d and hide a lack of representation or overlook issues faced by particular ethnic groups.\u00a0"
