I am so excited about work I wake every day with a smile on my face. The people I work with are extremely friendly and always finding ways to support my growth and development. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more. My apprenticeship has given me a massive confidence boost, which is translating into other aspects of my life, and I can\u2019t wait for what the future holds."

I\u2019m now more confident meeting and talking to new people, and I am beginning to realise the importance of networking. It is a challenge for me to say \u2018hello\u2019 but by remembering to do this, I have formed new relationships, and this has resulted in opportunities to progress my career. These include being the site champion for our transport planning practice page, which involves me working with people from across the globe to inform the transport planning community at Mott MacDonald about all the amazing work going on in the team. I have also had the opportunity to speak with people who\u2019d you describe as \u2018transport planning royalty\u2019 and discussed with them what the future holds and the importance of apprenticeships in the industry."

From sitting in the classroom learning about regeneration to now actually planning the transport to support a regeneration project, or from learning about climate change to now actually being part of the journey to net-zero and supporting behaviour change and modal shift."

It is great that we are encouraged to be innovative and to work collaboratively to fit all the puzzle pieces together to find to the answer. It\u2019s not always easy but it is what makes the job so interesting, and I am so happy I was picked for the apprenticeship!"

At work, everyone is so friendly, and they always involve me, and this makes me so happy that I can be myself and don\u2019t have to worry about being judged."

I also recommend you take every opportunity possible and always seek to find more. But most importantly, don\u2019t give up!"
