It describes using art in policy, with reference to Glass House, an installation/experience which I created as a practising visual artist and as part of a Clore Leadership Fellowship. The first blog in the series described a co-design process at the Design for Planet festival which coincided with COP26 and the second considered systems mapping."

Since then I have continued this inquiry through a process of practice-based research. This includes learning from Policy Lab projects like our multimedia collaboration with the Department for Transport on the Manual for Streets and our speculative flags on the future of maritime autonomy. It also included my own research and practice conducted with the support of Clore Leadership, the Social Design Institute and the Arts and Humanities Research Council.\u00a0"

            "text": "In Autumn 2021, I produced Glass House. The installation/experience comprised seven artworks capturing data and information about climate change, portrayed on reclaimed glass, arranged in an evocative, low lit space. Glass House took place at Lumen Studios in a crypt in Bethnal Green and was attended by groups of 2-5 people who were specifically invited but who did not know each other. This invite-only approach was required to comply with the venue\u2019s social distancing policy, but it also meant that people from different disciplines and life experience could be intentionally brought together in small groups. This video provides an overview of Glass House."

            "text": "Each of the artworks in Glass House speaks to a possible role for art in policy. For example, the work Layers of Bangladesh provides a highly visual and interactive way of overlaying climate and socioeconomic data relating to Bangladesh. Layers of Southeast Asia, a piece comprising three glass panels, represents a human-sized counterpoint to this - the three panels showed changes in rainfall, flooding and population in the region. Participants noted how their own height, their physicality and how they moved in relation to the panels changed their understanding of the data."

        {
            "text": "In all of the works in Glass House, data is depicted on glass sourced from allotment owners looking to revamp or remove old greenhouses on their plots. On some pieces I worked hard to polish and grind the panes back into a pristine state. For other artworks I sought to draw a line between the jagged and fragile materials and the emotional and existentialist nature of climate change. To this end, Broken Arctic Map shows the reduction in the Arctic ice sheet between 1979 and 2020, engraved on scratched and broken 10mm glass. The images of the effects of climate change depicted in Greenhouse Panes are distorted, blistered and washed out to the point of being illegible."

            "text": "The final piece in the show was Climate Data Discovery. This installation arranged 40 pieces of climate evidence around a space. Participants were invited to look at the information in their own time, focusing on what they found interesting. After 30 minutes I asked the guests to sit on the chairs, facing each other, and discuss what information they found most striking and the policy implications. The dialogue between participants, reflecting on the tangible and intangible aspects of the works they had seen, was intended as the final work of art in the Glass House installation."

            "text": "There are some interesting precedents to the use of art in policymaking contexts. Already, artworks adorn the walls of places where British policy decisions are taken in the guise of the Government Art Collection. The New York City Government runs a Public Artists in Residence programme, embedding artists in spaces like the NYC Department of Sanitation or NYC Department of Reports and Information Services, working on the premise that artists are \u2018creative problem-solvers\u2019."

        {
            "text": "An intriguing example is the Artist Placement Group, a British innovation from the 1960s and 1970s. Initially the APG worked across the public sector and in private industries, but in 1972 the artist Barbara Steveni negotiated an agreement called the Whitehall Civil Service Memorandum with the UK government to expand the role of the APG to government organisations including the Scottish Office and the National Department of Health and Social Security. The artists worked alongside staff from all parts of the organisation for months or years, and sought to develop \u2018proposals\u2019 which could have a transformative impact upon the host organisations\u2019 work. There are fascinating examples of impact, from video artworks broadcast on national TV to Ian Breakwell\u2019s Diary, an ongoing multimedia journal which empowered a team at Broadmoor psychiatric hospital to introduce a more consultative approach to improving patients\u2019 conditions."

            "text": "In 1959 the writer CP Snow produced Two Cultures, an influential book which reflected and perhaps reinforced the notion that the arts and sciences sit on opposite sides of an academic debate. The last ten years have seen encouraging movements towards a more fluid, interchangeable and interdisciplinary understanding of the merits of different methods in addressing policy challenges. CERN, the large hadron collider in Geneva, presides over a formidable artistic programme. Central Saint Martins, a historic London art school, runs an MA in Art and Science. The UK\u2019s Government Office for Science have used artistic photography in a report on waste and commissioned Policy Lab to use speculative design in a 2015 project on the ageing population, the first ever project using this method in a national government."

            "text": "Climate change is almost the quintessential complex, multi-system problem. It requires creativity, empathy, emotional sensitivity and intellectual rigour to address it. This will likely mean engaging citizens in meaningful conversations; demystifying and opening up evidence to a wider public audience; and thinking beyond the status quo in terms of what a solution could be. Art is one of the strategies we can bring to bear on policy challenges like this."
