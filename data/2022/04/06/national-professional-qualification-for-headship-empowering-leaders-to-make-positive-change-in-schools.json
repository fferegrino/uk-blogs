On a personal level, I also want to deliver change confidently and consistently, while inspiring more women to become headteachers."

It also appealed as it\u2019s delivered by school leaders and experts and has thriving peer-to-peer support which will help me to gain a greater understanding of leadership concepts and change management."

I then completed an NPQ in senior leadership (NPQSL), which improved my knowledge of strategic planning and management across different projects."

Getting buy-in from staff, outlining visions, planning and implementation aren\u2019t always skills we get a chance to practise regularly in the classroom but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t important. My NPQs helped me understand the nuance behind making changes in school and made a big difference to how I delivered them."

            "text": "As we move out of the pandemic, we have a real opportunity to lead schools towards a brighter future with expert teachers focused on making sure that all children get a great education. Whatever stage of your career you\u2019re at, in my experience an NPQ can help you build the skills you need. And, as all of the NPQs are available for free, they\u2019re a really accessible and attractive opportunity for all teachers that give you so much more than a short CPD course can."
