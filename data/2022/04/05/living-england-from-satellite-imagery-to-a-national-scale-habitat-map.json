This probability map, which is freely available to view and use, will provide important data for environmental policy decision making, and can guide efforts to support nature\u2019s recovery. The Living England team tells us more about this highly anticipated product and why its release is so exciting..."

The Living England habitat probability map shows the extent and distribution of broad habitats across England, providing a valuable insight into our natural capital assets and helping to inform land management decisions. It is funded by and supports the Environmental Land Management (ELM) Schemes and the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) Programme."

            "text": "The Living England project highlights the innovation and technical excellence developed within Natural England. The team has broken new ground through the development of complex yet robust workflows operating on a national scale, to provide full coverage of England\u2019s diverse habitats. The habitat probability map uses open-source datasets allowing the publication of this map for the first time under an Open Government Licence (OGL), making it widely available for use in environmental applications. Whilst accuracy varies between different habitats and regional zones, Phase IV achieved an average habitat classification accuracy of 88%."

The Living England team work closely alongside Natural England field teams to ensure habitat data collected on the ground are compliant with access permissions and provide the models with the right information to inform the habitat classification. As part of the project, they have created bespoke tools including an application to help with targeting the collection of data points to continuously improve the model and mobilise field surveyors to areas requiring further information."

Since then, the method has grown substantially, allowing us to incorporate a wider range of geospatial datasets and capitalise on advances in data processing and analysis."
