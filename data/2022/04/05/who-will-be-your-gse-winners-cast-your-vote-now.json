            "text": "Members from across the Profession have already submitted posters to be presented at the conference and they were highlighted in the GSE March 2022 Newsletter. These fantastic posters allow members to share their latest work across the profession and give them an opportunity to connect and network with colleagues. They are also very important in demonstrating the incredible range of topics GSE members are working on - from antibiotic resistance and building nuclear-powered submarines to battery safety and machine learning in flood forecasting. We hope you\u2019ll appreciate the incredible breadth of the profession, the expertise the profession offers, and the benefits of our work to society."
