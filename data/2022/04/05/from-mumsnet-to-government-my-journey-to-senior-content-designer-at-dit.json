            "text": "My path to joining the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Content Design team at the Department for International Trade (DIT) began in the private sector. I spent a couple of years growing my content skills at Mumsnet, a parenting website. I worked closely with other digital disciplines, including developers and User Experience (UX) designers. I also worked with external brands, resolving tensions between brand dominance and\u00a0the tone and style of the website."

        {
            "text": "These experiences helped me grow a combination of strong problem-solving and stakeholder management skills, setting me up well for a Civil Service Content Designer role. Following a simple application and one interview, I entered as a Content Designer at Higher Executive Officer (HEO) level, with no explicit experience in \u2018Content Design\u2019 or working in government. Two years later, I am a Senior Content Designer at Senior Executive Officer (SEO) level."

The DDaT team at DIT is signed up to the capability pay framework attached to the DDaT Profession Capability Framework.

            "text": "The nature of Content Design work at DIT is complex, varied, and exciting. I was motivated to join the department by the range of services that DIT provides for exporters, investors and importers. The scope of the work across both GOV.UK web pages and digital products, and the opportunity to pursue more strategic roles at higher grades, also appealed to me. I\u2019ve also had the chance to be involved in the delivery of projects at the heart of government, such as the publication of the UK\u2019s new free trade agreements."

With this support, I eagerly look ahead to future prospects. DIT offers such a variety of opportunities."

This makes for a great mix of differing backgrounds and ideas, and we are not held back by legacy digital services. It also means that many people here are new to the department or to government, just as I was two years ago!"
