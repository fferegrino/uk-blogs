The Committee may also advise that the proposed appointment or activity is unsuitable. For Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and their equivalents leaving office, there is also a minimum waiting period of three months before taking up employment. ACOBA can reduce the general rule that there is a two-year lobbying ban in some circumstances, or recommend that it need not prevent communication with government on matters that are \u201can integral part of the normal course of business for the organisation concerned\u201d."
