Healthy plants and trees benefit us all, which is why it is so important that we work together to look after our trees, woodlands, and forests."

            "text": "Biosecurity refers to the precautions we can take that help to prevent the introduction and spread of harmful organisms. For plants and trees, these can include non-native pests, such as insects, and disease-causing organisms called pathogens, such as some viruses, bacteria and fungi. The impact these pose is enormous. Ash dieback alone is predicted to kill anywhere up to 100 million trees, costing the economy up to \u00a315bn over the coming decades."

            "text": "People often suggest that simply banning imports would be the best solution to help protect our plants and trees. However, many pests and pathogens can enter the country by other means including people bringing plants back from abroad, while some pests and pathogens arrive here on the wind. Consumer demand for choice, food security and environmental resilience to climate change are other reasons why a simple ban wouldn\u2019t be practical and demonstrate why we need to get the balance right."

This means trebling tree planting rates by the end of this Parliament and planting 30,000 hectares of trees across the UK per year by 2025. To help achieve these targets the Forestry Commission launched the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) last year, with \u00a315.9 million available to landowners to plant and manage trees in the first year alone."

Planting and establishing more domestically grown trees will play an important role in this, meaning now more than ever there is a need to ensure we continue to lead and improve our world class biosecurity standards."

Xylella can affect a huge range of plants and trees, including several species of broadleaved trees grown in the UK, such as\u202foak and elm. Xylella has devastated olive groves in Puglia, Italy, although it hasn\u2019t reached the UK yet."
