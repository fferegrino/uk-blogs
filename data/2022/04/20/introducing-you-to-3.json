This involves working on complaints relating to current schemes such as the Basic Payment, Environmental and Countryside Stewardship Schemes. As a caseworker, I talk to the customer or agent to understand the reasons for the complaint, and then investigate, liaising with multiple departments across RPA. I also refer to our specialist guidance, before making a recommendation based on the complaint outcome. This is discussed with my manager and, if necessary, higher management. I then inform the customer or agent of the outcome."

It\u2019s important to understand any lessons learnt or improvements we can make for the future to ensure the same issue doesn\u2019t happen again. I believe continuous feedback and learning, combined with great customer service, has the greatest impact on our customers."
