And as we begin to emerge from another winter, the green shoots of innovation were more welcome than ever at the Knowledge Assets Spring Showcase, where we got a sneak preview of some amazing new technologies and other fantastic developments from the knowledge assets arena."

Sometimes the secondary product of a primary activity, such as research and development, project delivery or managing physical assets. We were welcomed by Deputy Directors, Charles Price and Rachel Egan from the Knowledge Assets Team who gave an overview of the project\u2019s achievements this year and a look forward for the next 12 months."

It\u2019s the role of ONS, as the UK\u2019s national statistical office, to report data on the UN global goals which reflect not just environmental sustainability but the five pillars of people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. The goals cover a wide range of issues including gender equality, responsible consumption, innovation and the quality of education. These topics are high on the agenda \u2013 not just for Government and policymakers \u2013 but for commercial businesses too. The public and customers are interested in how businesses demonstrate their performance in areas such as sustainability and diversity - showing with hard data that they are living these values."

First, the Open SDG reporting platform, an online webpage which is open source and free to use and already been implemented in over 30 countries, cities and places around the world. The team\u2019s second asset is their non-official sources protocol, a methodology which looks at SDG data, comparing it against a number of criteria to evaluate its robustness, timeliness and overall quality. The ONS team could help businesses identify the SDGs that are most relevant to them and evaluate which goals they can best contribute to. This would be done by applying the ONS SDG team\u2019s knowledge and standards to ensure high quality data is used to report the goals and help to set the highest possible standards in sustainability reporting for businesses."

This pioneering work is a real breakthrough in diagnostic technology and aims, through early detection to reduce the number of amputations that patients with diabetes unfortunately endure. The grant funding allowed the team to overcome a key regulatory hurdle in getting the first UKCA marked device approved, which will allow for an initial rollout of devices for use by clinicians."

This technology avoids the use of harmful radiation in detecting cancers and promises safe and early diagnosis for millions of people. With the knowledge assets funding, the team could increase the resolution of the technology and focus on patient wellbeing by making the device more comfortable during scans, which will allow rollout into clinical environments which is so important for an early-stage medical device."

            "text": "The third application makes use of graphene, a novel form of carbon which has myriad applications in science and technology and medicine. NPL created biosensors which can detect antigens including coronavirus particles, and then realised the potential in repurposing this to test for all manner of diseases. We heard how the grant funding allowed NPL to work with a testing partner to optimise and validate a new prototype putting them in a great position to attract development partners and secure future funding."
