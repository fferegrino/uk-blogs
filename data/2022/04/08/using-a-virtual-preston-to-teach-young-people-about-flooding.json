With our local schools on board, we took over Year 7 for a day at Archbishop Temple School in Preston and delivered live Rivercraft lessons. Students completed online feedback for us, and the results blew me away with pupils proclaiming: \u201cI found the games themselves very realistic and taught me about the changes we need to make in society\u201d."

Some of the students were able to drown in the River Ribble and fall off rooftops but best of all, one of our future coders was able to hack into the back of the game, import a sword and chop up the Water Voles for lunch\u2026 that was certainly an interesting career highlight for me! Needless to say, all of the issue were quickly fixed. The teachers noted that they also needed training on how to play the games, especially after #watervolegate. We will be providing some training in the coming weeks."
