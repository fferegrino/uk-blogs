In the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team, we held the inaugural \u201cDDaT Dash\u201d. Billy Glover, Lead Product Manager in our CRM data team, organised the event, taking inspiration from a similar initiative his partner ran in the Foreign Office."

With the move to remote working, this was a real chance to do something together whilst being apart. Between us, we travelled more than a marathon by walking, cycling and even rowing! However, the highlight was the supporting thread that ran in Microsoft Teams. Colleagues posted photos, left encouraging comments and decided that they would also like to join in."

It created connections between our colleagues around the country, strengthening our community within DDaT. Through only an online form and\u00a0 \u00a0Teams thread (as well as the enthusiasm of our colleagues!) we managed to brighten up a Wednesday in January. More importantly, we created an event that brought people together."

However, instead of competing to see who could do the most steps, we committed to our own personal step goals. This was to be inclusive of different working patterns and circumstances in the team. We encouraged each other to walk during meetings that we did not need to actively contribute towards, so we were more consistently mobile throughout the day. Afterwards, we reflected on whether we had met our personal targets in our team meeting."
