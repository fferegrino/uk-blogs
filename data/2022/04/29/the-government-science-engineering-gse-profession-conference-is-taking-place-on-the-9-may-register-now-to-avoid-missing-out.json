            "text": "Scientists and engineers play an essential role in improving the quality of government decisions. From ensuring that scientific evidence strengthens policy, to effectively communicating advice, which has been highlighted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference will serve as a way to showcase and celebrate the breadth of work that is taking place in science & engineering across government, from delivering solutions to large-scale challenges such as climate change, to work in exciting areas such as Artificial Intelligence. The conference also serves as a unique opportunity for science & engineering policy professionals to connect with other professionals."
