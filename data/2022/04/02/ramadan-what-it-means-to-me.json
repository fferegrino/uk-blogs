At the Department for Transport, I was Co-Chair of the DfT Muslim Network, and an Executive Member of the Civil Service Muslim Network."

Although having joined Defra during lockdown, I was quickly welcomed to the team and noticed how important inclusivity is in Defra. I hope sharing my experiences will be educational to others and encourage discussion around what\u2019s important to each of us."

Ramadan officially begins when the month of Shaban, the eighth month of the Islamic (Hijri) calendar, ends. As the Islamic calendar is based around the lunar cycle, Ramadan rotates by approximately ten days each year.\nRamadan is a time of spiritual reflection, of self-improvement, and worship, as well as the most known action \u2013 fasting from sunrise to sunset."

There\u2019s a bigger goal to refine and refresh ourselves, both physically and mentally \u2013 a way of recharging our spiritual batteries once a year."

There are many lessons to be learned from this, and as a result I try to contemplate, change my behaviour, and increase my good deeds. For example, I need to be extra conscious of my actions: no lying, swearing (remember, just examples\u2026)."

This is because during a fast, the body uses up its store of glucose (our usual source of energy), and once this runs out, it dissolves any extra fats."

Eating, sleeping, and praying later than usual, and waking up earlier than usual to eat, makes for a very tired Afshan. However - I have a Ramadan strategy!

Not just because we get to eat, but because I get to spend quality time with my family. We don\u2019t usually get to spend dinner times together due to our different schedules and work patterns \u2013 be assured that we get a full table every single night during Ramadan!"
