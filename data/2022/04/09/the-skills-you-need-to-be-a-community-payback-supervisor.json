If you can relate to the people in your group, in the main they\u2019ll respond positively to you. Yes, people on probation have committed an offence, but they\u2019re people just like you and me."

And it\u2019s then that it\u2019s important to try to understand why they\u2019re behaving like that. Sometimes, it can simply be because it\u2019s the weekend and they\u2019re resenting missing out on the football, or spending time with their kids, partner or mates. Or, more often than not, they don\u2019t think they should have been sentenced to CP and have to do unpaid work."

Listening, understanding and relating to what people have to say about their personal situation, can help improve their attitude and co-operation. I find that spending time working alongside them, talking, and discussing their concerns, can sometimes be all it takes."

And getting people to think more positively. Even if it\u2019s focusing on the date of their last CP session, rather than dwelling on the total number of hours they need to complete, can set someone\u2019s mood for the day."
