There are no late evenings, you\u2019ll enjoy a range of great Civil Service benefits, plus you\u2019ll get real job satisfaction supervising prisoners to learn new skills. If you're looking for a catering job where you can make an impact far beyond the kitchen, read on to see what one of our current caterers has to say about his work, and take a look at our current vacancies."

The shift patterns and working hours \u2013 particularly not having to do antisocial hours \u2013 are also a real bonus.\u201d"

We let the prisoner workers in at 8.30am. I work with a team of other caterers and we\u2019re each allocated to a particular workstation. I\u2019m generally on the hot meal section and start by briefing the team of prisoners I\u2019ll be working with on what meals we\u2019ll be preparing and what they need to do. I\u2019ll demonstrate any new dishes and supervise what they\u2019re doing throughout the day. We prepare and serve lunch and dinner menus."

            "text": "Working in a prison\n\u201cBefore I started in adult prisons, I had a catering job in a young offenders\u2019 institution. While I didn\u2019t supervise offenders, it gave me experience of working in a custodial setting. I\u2019d also previously taught cooking to young people. So, working in a prison catering role where I\u2019d get to pass on my skills to adult offenders, felt like a logical next step."

            "text": "As I\u2019d already seen the security measures that were in place in my youth offending job, I wasn\u2019t daunted by the idea of working alongside prisoners. I carry a radio, there are panic buttons around the kitchen if we need them, and processes to follow that keep everyone safe. I\u2019ve never had to use any of them.\u201d"

        {
            "text": "Making a positive difference \n\u201cMy attitude is that, while the prisoners have made mistakes that have landed them in prison, they\u2019re not necessarily bad people. Generally, they\u2019re happy to be working and keen to learn how to make new dishes. I enjoy seeing them becoming more confident and knowing the difference this can make. Working in the kitchen gives them an opportunity to learn new skills they can use when they leave custody. Plus they have opportunities to get qualifications in food hygiene or study for a catering NVQ, which can increase their potential to find paid work."

            "text": "Working as a prison caterer is an excellent career. I love cooking and get to combine my passion with working with a great team of people while passing on my skills to help prisoners potentially reduce their risk of reoffending. That\u2019s a great feeling, and very rewarding.\u201d"
