            "text": "Aerial surveillance is concentrated on identifying symptoms such as canopy dieback and defoliation. Ground-based surveys focus on partial branch dieback, with associated resinous cankers; and needle cast (where needles have turned brown or fallen off). Where symptoms do occur, they tend to be forest edges along corridors such as roads, rides, and watercourses."

            "text": "Aerial surveillance is undertaken, both from helicopters and using drones. 12 helicopter flights have taken place covering the south-west and south-east of England and in Wales. As well as being able to target specific areas, aerial surveys are also adaptable; for example P. pluvialis aerial surveillance can be conducted simultaneously with that of Ips typographus or Phytophthora ramorum, therefore monitoring overall tree health of an area. Surveillance via drones is providing high resolution panoramic imagery, mapping products for monitoring symptom progression, and contextual site information."

            "text": "These surveillance techniques help to identify outbreaks of P. pluvialis at the earliest point enabling measures to be put in place that minimise the spread of the disease. Any new findings undergo further intensive investigation to ascertain the extent of infection. This informs decision making on the appropriate restrictions required, such as on timber movement or specifying work to be undertaken under a Statutory Plant Health Notice e.g. tree felling or understorey removal of affected material."

            "text": "Surveillance has identified findings of P. pluvialis at 31 woodland sites across Great Britain since commencing in September last year. The majority of these findings are on western hemlock, and in most cases, affected sites consist of a small number of infected trees forming part of the roadside understorey and in other cases findings are limited to individual young trees with partial branch dieback."

            "text": "Findings in Douglas fir have been fewer and generally made in association with heavier western hemlock infection.

Forest Research have tested over 1,170 samples since the first outbreak. This is a comprehensive study, testing material from stems, branches, foliage (needles), bark, roots, soil/leaf litter, saplings/seed trails, water baits in streams, and rainwater traps capturing aerially transmitted spores. Real-time PCR based methods are used for testing the samples for P. pluvilais ensuring rapid results with high levels of accuracy."

This sharing of knowledge on the surveying, sampling and the testing helps to provide comparable data. We also have continued collaboration with scientific experts in overseas countries, such as the USA and New Zealand, who have been studying this disease over the past few years. This intelligence has helped Forest Research to improve P. pluvialis diagnostics, information that is shared with partners at Fera Science and SASA (Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture) thus supporting wider scientific and practitioner understanding of P. pluvialis."

This report covered the first identification of this pathogen in Europe, as well as being the first published report of P.pluvialis causing resinous cankers on western hemlock. Such reports are shared with peers in other European countries allowing them to consider this pathogen as part of their surveillance strategies for the disease."

            "text": "As with any new pest or disease outbreak, our first response is generally aimed at eradication, this prompts the serving of Statutory Plant Health Notices requiring the felling and destruction of infected trees. Teams are mobilised rapidly to prepare a site for harvesting and any critical features of interest are identified. For example, plans for the protection of special habitats, watercourses and archaeological features are agreed and defined. Special maps are created showing the location of each feature with a description of the controls and requirements. On the ground they are marked using paint, signs, and tape, while the harvesting team are fully briefed before any work can commence. Signs inform visitors of the timing and extent of works, and also advise the public not to enter the work site or approach any of the machines for biosecurity and safety reasons. All machines are washed down before leaving a site, while tools, equipment and clothing are treated with disinfectant. Visitors are also asked to undertake good biosecurity practices, such as washing mud from their footwear and pets before leaving a site."

        {
            "text": "Some trees are felled using specialist machines which hold the tree as it is cut down, enabling them to be cut and lowered to the ground in a controlled way. The machine then strips the branches off, cuts the trunks into pre-determined lengths and places these in a way that allows a second machine to collect them and move them to the forest road, accessible to lorries. Other trees may need to be cut by experienced tree fellers, for instance, in protected areas where machines are prohibited."

            "text": "Older, larger trees offer the greatest risk of spreading the disease by releasing the spores high up, where the wind can carry spores across the landscape. The most infectious parts of the trees are the branches and foliage which are removed as the trees are felled. The highly infectious material is burnt within the infected site ensuring material cannot be moved to other areas. The remaining logs are then transported from the felling area to the specially prepared stacking area before being utilised by specially authorised mills which can meet the biosecurity rules required. This makes sure that any infectious parts of the tree are disposed of carefully as the log is processed."
        },
        {
            "text": "Elsewhere in the demarcated areas, inspectors check any sites where landowners plan to fell trees to ensure there are no signs of infection. Even healthy trees can only be felled and moved off site if they are sent to authorised timber mills. This way the risk of spreading the infection through movement is minimised."
