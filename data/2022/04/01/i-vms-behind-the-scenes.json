I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their contributions, which have helped us put in place the level of help and support fishers have told us that they need. Everything from how to choose, buy and install an onboard device to helping navigate the grants application process. (More helpful advice can be found on our frequently asked questions page)"

These initial test \u2018pings\u2019 are part of the grant process and won\u2019t be used for any other purpose than to confirm devices are operationally ready for full transmission to I-VMS Hub when it becomes a legal requirement at the end of the year."

The information we receive from I-VMS will help us feedback where fishing can be done sustainably and give fishers the ability to make informed choices on where they choose to fish."
