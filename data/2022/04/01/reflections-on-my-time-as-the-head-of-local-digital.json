In this blog post, I want to reflect back on the lessons learnt and achievements, such as bringing local authorities together to solve common challenges, and in particular how a group of local authorities and suppliers are cooperating together to deliver an open source solution."

The Fund has shown that if the main barriers of collaboration are removed (such as funding) and collaboration is incentivised, then local authorities can and will come together to solve common issues."

The approach is based on sociocracy working groups and platform co-op governance. These are not new, but are not often used in local government and it\u2019s exciting to see such shared ownership approaches being tested."

This also drove the development of solutions that catered for different population sizes, demographics and service profiles, as the Housing Repairs project demonstrates in the image below."

I\u2019m leaving a team that is made up of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever worked with and I\u2019m super proud of what we have achieved together, including rapidly responding to support local authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic, and successfully bidding for \u00a385m funding for the programme. I know the team will continue to thrive as we all share the same passion for improving local government services."
