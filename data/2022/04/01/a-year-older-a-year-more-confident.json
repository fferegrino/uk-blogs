I joined a HR team that live our values by being inclusive, expert and working with integrity. I joined an organisation ready to be established as an independent public body; and soon the TRA will be celebrating its own one-year anniversary."

My first week ended with me holding one-to-one staff consultations as part of the setting up of the TRA as an independent body and the pace has carried on since then. For me, feeling I was contributing so soon was just what I needed."

They are involved in helping our team identify priorities and deliver HR solutions, from working with our (newly created) Staff Voice Forum on ways to build our workplace inclusivity, to facilitating all-staff discussions on hybrid working. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to influence and the autonomy to make decisions and help a start-up public body start to find its identity and mojo."
