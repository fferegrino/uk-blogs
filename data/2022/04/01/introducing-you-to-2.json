I sometimes arrange a call back from the operational team if I can\u2019t answer their query. I really hope the customer goes away feeling that a call to us has been worthwhile and they\u2019re happy with the service we\u2019ve given them. We quite often have a chat as well about the weather and family life \u2013 it really makes you connect with your customer more when you feel at ease."

It has also been great to share my knowledge by way of hints and tips on the work areas of the Customer Service Centre.\u00a0 I recently had a workbook published within RPA for the Customer Service Centre operatives on how to guide a customer through a Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) application."

I also worked in an accountant\u2019s office for four years and moved to work in what was one of our local breweries in the accounts office. From there I went to work for the DSS in the benefits fraud department, then moved over to the Job Centre before joining the RPA in 1998, when we were known as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)."

The hanging basket side has developed into me doing a lot for other places as well and it gets very busy when you\u2019re growing the plants from seeds."

It\u2019s not true when they say things get easier as they get older! I also have a 17-year-old grandson who is now doing a joinery apprenticeship and a 14-year-old, very laid back, granddaughter. At home there is my husband and Archie, our Cocker Spaniel, who is totally spoilt."
