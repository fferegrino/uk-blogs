So some of the things that we've been looking at in the last year in particular is, how do we accelerate our speed in delivering new services? How do we up the ante on reuse? How do we really embrace reusing and building things once and particularly looking at our platform, cross Integration and across Digital, we have lots of teams struggling with the technologies of building new platforms. And we've been working on the concept of platform as a product and building the platform once, and then using that common and shared platform. So it's been a really busy time on that. And that's what we're going to be talking a little bit about in today's podcast."

And also we've looked at what is the best possible resilience we can get. How much automation could we put into this process? And it's really come to light the limitations that we have as an organisation much like any, with regards to bringing in engineering talent to solve some of the major challenges that we have, which has led us to really work collaboratively across the department to work on this common platform that provides an ecosystem whereby we can really, really utilise effectively the resources that we have, and also drive the significant change as a result."

        {
            "text": "So the theory behind the common platform is that we build the platform once. So if we think about our hosting platform and our environments that we deploy our applications into, traditionally we've worked in a way where each team won their product end to end and they spend a bit of time building the development environment, building their common tool set, building up their platform. Then they get to building the application. And it's the application that contains all of the features."
        },
        {
            "text": "And if we think about all of the slight variations across the platforms, they're all kind of doing the same things. They\u2019re hosting applications and they\u2019re support the applications. But with those slight variations, it means that every platform becomes bespoke, and it's unmanageable, difficult to support and costly to support. By having a common platform, it means that we've got a standard approach to providing the hosting platform and the tooling that goes along with that. So we build the platform once and it's there as an easily consumable resource for feature teams. So we can remove the cognitive load from the feature teams of building platforms. And the platform was built by the expert team and push of a button, the platform can be there, the common tooling can be there. And that enables the line of business teams and the feature teams to focus, where they should be focusing on is building new features. Dean can talk a little bit about how we've done that and the technologies and tooling that we've got in the common platform, Dean?"

        {
            "text": "Thanks, Jacqui. Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's all about adopting more cloud native ways of working and when we talk about cloud native, it's more of an ephemeral environment where we can really abstract away most of the complexities with the underlying infrastructure. So again, that we just look to enable the teams to focus on actually delivering the value. If they're engineering and product resource that will benefit citizens, for example, reusing the majority of the underlying platform that teams can benefit from."
        },
        {
            "text": "So we looked at that as a new model. And we also looked at what needs to change organisationally to allow the teams that exist at the minute to cooperate effectively within this new ecosystem, and how those communication channels might be improved through the likes of Team Topologies etc and the thinking there.\u00a0 A lot of this brings about more of a cultural change. And we wanted to demonstrate it with the core team with a common purpose to drive out a number of experiments to show how this could be done at scale."

We don't have unlimited, super skilled engineers, who can influence the entire stack and ecosystem and take us to where we needed to be."

            "text": "Similarly, the wider ecosystem around the likes of Kubernetes and all this other great technology moves at a pace which is quite uncomfortable for large organisations. You know, we have to be mindful that we have services that will need to maintain a level of uptime for our citizens etc, and compliance with regards to what can be put into production and when. So that being said, we have to be cautious around the technology that we choose to ensure that we tick all of those boxes."

        {
            "text": "I think, for me, when Dean first brought the common platform to me as a concept, the thing that got me immediately excited about it was looking at the number of DevOps that were based within the feature teams. I was almost matching DevOps one for one with software engineers. And that's a really high ratio. And when I was looking at why did a need have such a high demand for such a scarce skill, and a really deep technical skill, as well. And it really came to light that everybody was building, each of the teams were building their platforms to host their applications. And were building it many times."
        },
        {
            "text": "And when we think about things like monitoring, alerting, making sure that our systems were scalable, robust, all of that. And we were repeating an awful lot of things across the team. And that led me to think well we must be repeating that across Digital. So as Dean said, we started with an experiment. And we actually rallied round a hybrid team. So we brought in our hybrid cloud platform team with the integration team, plus some of the citizen information team that were building services that would be hosted on it."
        },
        {
            "text": "So traditionally, we would build micro services and host the micro services on it and expose them through APIs. So bringing all of that together in those three facets of building out a service worked really well. And it meant that we could build something that was co-created so teams could buy into it. So that need was really driven to not just in terms of reducing the number of people needed to build platforms, but really to help us get those feature teams focusing on the features and applications. So the platform was available as a push button deployment and then go. So it not only sped up delivery, it meant more effective use of our resource and avoided that cognitive overload load on our engineering staff."

And like any transformation, it doesn't change, because you're constantly trying to evolve, you're really testing and learning and really building deep connections within the department by removing those silos. So it's an ongoing, ongoing journey."

            "text": "As Dean says the technology is well proven. So this core technology is Red Hat, chosen very open source product, it's agnostic to whatever programming language our applications are built in, really flexible. The work that we've been doing and running experiments and co-creating, we didn't start off with a known outcome. We started off with some good intent and some experiments and proved and disproved some hypotheses, and then moved forward. So we've really done this in an iterative way over the last 12 months, and bringing people on the journey with us."
        },
        {
            "text": "So some of it's been about the technology and how we get Kubernetes up and running with a API gateway embedded in the platform. But a lot of that has been about open leadership, allowing the team to grow, helping people upskill our platform SMEs and really coming on. And we've evolved into not just the common platform, but the platform as a product. So we now treat our platform as a product in the same way that we treat any other product. So our platform has a backlog, it has a product manager, it has a team that sits around it. And it's fed and watered in the same way as all of our other products. So it's kept refreshed. And that's been a real game shift for us over the 12 months."

            "text": "There's been a myriad of various different benefits by working in this way, if I'm honest. So we could focus solely on the technical by adopting more true automation within our pipelines, the likes of GitOps, etc. And operators within Kubernetes, we've significantly reduced the amount of error that we\u2019d previously seen with regards to deployments. So change failure rate has been significantly reduced."
        },
        {
            "text": "But more importantly, the time it takes us to put something into production from its initial idea is significantly reduced as well. So I think there was some headline figures with regards it took around four to five days from the full lead time to around 30 minutes. We have that ability to safely put things into production, and more effectively roll back with minimal impact to our citizens, etc. So we're really, really pushing the benefits of working in containerised Kubernetes cloud native environment."

        {
            "text": "On the cultural side of things we've actually seen by working this way, by creating this space for our engineers and other colleagues to really drive this change and experiment, we've seen some really key KPIs with regards to increased motivation, and general staff wellbeing etc, to the extent where we've managed to bring engineers who were perhaps not feeling quite at home within the department, into this new team and new way of working. And they've subsequently said that this has been an actually fantastic experience for them. And they are so motivated and committed to drive forward this change."

        {
            "text": "We've just stood up a new product for external data sharing. And normally, at least the first four or five sprints would have been working on standing up the platform and getting all the tooling ready. And in reality, it took them one sprint to adopt the new platform, and then focus on the application that they're building themselves. So that's eight weeks off the timeline straight away, that's not even taking account of the bumps that they would hit in the road had they built their own platform. So the MI is there that really demonstrates that we are delivering faster."
        },
        {
            "text": "And the other thing that I'm seeing is less of a demand for DevOps in the teams, so the feature teams become more self-sufficient, which is much better position for the team to be in and helps that agility as well. So we're seeing maybe one DevOps person in some of the larger teams, and some of the teams don't have a DevOps, they share a DevOps across two or three teams. So we're seeing a reduction in the need. And that tells us that the adoption of the common platform is assisting the feature teams as well."

        {
            "text": "Yeah, love to talk about team topology. So I think if we look at DevOps and its evolution throughout its creation to now there's been year on year studies with regards to how organisations are adopting DevOps and how they would classify either high, medium or low performing DevOps with regards to the attributes and skills and etc, that we\u2019ve typically seen in the industry. And Team Topologies was born out of that study across, I think it was 35,000 organisations, which formed this body of evidence around how the introduction of DevOps will affect the culture and the outcomes with regards to faster, safer deliveries of value, etc."
        },
        {
            "text": "So this looked at from a cultural perspective, how teams could be formed and organized. But more effectively and more appropriately how teams can communicate with each other going forward to get the best possible flow and delivery with regards to DevOps and their changes. So it looks at identifying the movement from not only just DevOps, which traditionally sit in what we call our feature teams, which are multidisciplinary teams with a purpose to deliver a slice of value, or a product or an API or something that will deliver value to a citizen."
        },
        {
            "text": "And then team topology has brought about the concept of a platform team, which sits underneath that feature team, but has a way of communicating and collaborating, which encourages self-service. But the platform team's responsibility was to create those common reusable services or solutions that would really enable and accelerate the feature teams, like Jacqui mentioned earlier, taking away that cognitive load around what that feature team has to specifically do each time they make a change. So if we can provide common abstractions and automation technologies, then that would naturally mean that we could deliver faster, safer and achieve better flow."
        },
        {
            "text": "So the Team Topologies is all about from an organisational perspective how to create the best possible space for these teams to form and flourish. And we use the thinking and the practices and principles from that book to really strengthen the experiment that we ran within DWP, looking at traditional silos, taking Conway's Law into the equation, and really applying that really deep thinking into something that was more of a true experiment in DWP on a smaller scale, and then trying to use that as a this is how we need to organise our teams going forward."

We started off with a problem statement around the complexity of starting new product development and the complexity in every team building platforms. And we ran a set of hypothesis and experiments that's led us to where we\u2019re at."

And fortunately, our director Craig Eblett and our DG Simon McKinnon were supportive in that experimentation and taking that leap of faith, and it has paid off. And I think that's the thing from a leadership perspective is don't go into it with a predefined answer. It's true agile, it's true allow the team to evolve, and check in and change direction as and when you need to. And that was really important for us, it was really important that the team had that autonomy and had the ability to experiment, and then report back, take forward what worked and learn from what didn't."

The challenge there is that CNCF, that body of new start-ups and experiments that are bringing new tools, the organisations moves at a pace that's significantly hard to keep up with. What we need to do is we really need to focus on what is the right level of skills that DWP need to bring in and focus on engineers and bring that capability up as we grow the talent etc and also looking to the market with regards bringing those talent people into the organisation."

So that we know that everywhere has the security patches, the relevant guardrails that would stop things going into production when the shouldn't, the telemetry, the monitoring and alerting solution is the same so we can have good visibility across our environments."

So as opposed to building one thing and expecting everyone to come and live on it with the risk that that presents to the organization, instead we've got a really clear view on how do we create commonality across our clusters in any environment, any cloud, but also apply the same amount of policy and governance within the process whilst enabling self \u2013service, whilst enabling the teams to build and run their solutions in production."

So that will really enable us to decouple the building of containers for example, which is how our engineers interact or build their solutions and they can use any language any programming language, that is something that we've decided upon in DWP.

And because we've listened to those teams that are actually deploying into it and utilising it right from the outset, they've actually co created it, and helped to build it. So I think creating that community is really important. But also having the technical reference architecture and the guide rails for teams to work within is really important to maintain and promote the usage of the platform as well."

It's really important that engineers have the ability to choose the right languages etc, that are appropriate to get the best result from their product.

And similarly, we have now the ability to see everything as in a piece of code. So we treat everything as code. So we've got infrastructure as code, we've got software defined networks, we can quickly see how the environment is going to be composed. And that is our source of truth. Nothing can differ from that in the environment, we'll make sure that it always sticks to that, what is in the Git repo. And if that changes, it only changes through strict, robust processes where we have merge requests and peer reviews and sign offs, etc. So we have a good level of assurance that the environment is how we expect it."

We are seeing some of private sector moving this way, and there's certainly a lot of publicity around the Teams Topology book that were referenced earlier. So it's certainly growing and I think we'll see a lot more adoption of it, and certainly a lot more adoption of the platform as a product concept in the coming year or so as well. So I think we're quite ground-breaking in some of this. We're probably not first, but we're certainly one of the early adopters, I think it's fair to say."

So as we e assess the maturity levels of the teams who are working at a DevOps, or a platform engineering way of working, the underlying technology that powers that is absolutely similar to what we're deploying within DWP. So we're really using that to help validate and ensure that we are doing the right things.

So it was a really great recognition for the team and winning across 120 entries, and we won the UK region.
