The accommodation contracts are designed to be very different from the contract they replace. They have been developed with Service Personnel and families firmly in mind and in developing them, DIO collaborated closely with stakeholders including Service Personnel, their families and the Service Families Federations to ensure that their needs were fully considered."

            "text": "The Families Federations have played a particularly important part in helping shape the new contracts before they were tendered, testing our processes as we approach the in-service date, and communicating key messages to families. They will continue to do so in providing feedback on how the new services are being delivered and identifying areas for continuous improvement, which will be a key feature of FDIS. I am hugely grateful for their ongoing support to help us get this right for families."

In addition, these will deliver \u00a3171m of improvement and upgrade works in their first year alone. This builds on the unprecedented levels of investment we have recently made in improving the estate, with around \u00a3350m invested over the last two financial years."

A key focus for me has been on changing the culture of delivery by agreeing a \u2018Family First\u2019 approach with our industry partners, placing the needs of our families at the heart of what we do. This includes shifting our language and culture from maintaining assets and properties and allocating them to occupants, to providing high-quality homes and community spaces for families. This approach will be backed by enhanced customer service training that brings to life what it means to be a Service family through video interviews with families from all three Services."

Not everything will change overnight and some of the innovations FDIS will bring may take time for some to embed and deliver results, but we are working hard together to transform housing services for our Armed Forces."
