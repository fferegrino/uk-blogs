We kept on doing our lateral flow tests until they were clear, and we were both glad we made it, as we came home with two entirely unexpected surprises: Awards for Net Zero Carbon Strategy and Net Zero Leader of the Year."

Chris Packham, who was hosting the event, said he wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to the EA \u201cunsung heroes\u201d.\u00a0 And everyone clapped. Simon and I blushed and told each other how much we wished that everyone across the EA who had helped to create our new strategy - and there are so many of you, right across the business - could have been there to hear his words, and to celebrate with us."

But just for one night it was great to stop, and pause, and recognise all we have already done together, to get the EA to this point, so we can truly \u201cwalk the walk\u201d and turn our words into vital action over the coming decade."

Together, we can protect people, enhance nature, tackle climate change, and work towards a better future."
