So, under the steady stewardship of product manager Major Chris Bulmer, our team created the concept of \u2018Scenes\u2019. In brief, a scene captures an activity, undertaken to achieve a military effect and it can result from one or many user research sessions, from which several user journeys are woven together within a wider ecosystem. A scene helps demonstrate how individual actors, groups and entities interconnect, and the issues encountered during the lifespan of that specific experience."
