            "text": "Stress Awareness Month has been held every April since 1992 to raise awareness about what stress is, how it can affect us and what tools and support mechanisms are available to help those who need it. A little bit of stress can be good for you, but too much can lead to burnout. Some of the signs of stress or burnout include feeling overwhelmed, trouble sleeping, racing thoughts, and eating more or less than usual."

Nearly 500 staff attended the call and shared the different things they do to de-stress, ranging from going for a run, reading a book, and laughing with family and friends, to listening to the birds, singing in a choir and working with animals. My particular favourite was the calming effect of listening to wind chimes - I will have to invest in some for my own garden!"

All our staff are also encouraged to complete an e-learning mental health and resilience training course, as well as take part in additional activities such as meditation. We also share wellbeing toolkits with links to further resources and support services, including the NHS, The Stress Management Society and charities such as Mind."

A senior leader and one of our mental health first aiders will be sharing their own experiences and things they have found useful in helping cope with stress. I particularly enjoy the opportunity to take a break and often dial into the conversation while going for a walk to help get me away from my desk and out in nature (one of my own stress-busting tools!)."
