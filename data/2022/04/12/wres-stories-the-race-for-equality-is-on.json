Choosing to be one of the first local authorities to be part of the SCWRES represented a huge commitment by senior leaders in adult social care, children\u2019s services and Hertfordshire County Council (HCC) to create meaningful change."

            "text": "Starting the work was daunting, being part of the SCWRES challenges and encourages all involved to question what is normal and taken for granted. It requires us to be disruptors. I was hopeful the SCWRES would bring change, aware it would not be straightforward and that it would take too long for change to be experienced."

            "text": "Having worked in social care for many years, I have seen the demographic make-up of our local workforce change, experienced personal challenges and seen other people face them too. Being part of the SCWRES is already having a positive impact and contributing to the work we\u2019re doing in HCC to celebrate our diversity and become an organisation where all feel included and that they belong. I will continue to do all I can to create sustainable, lasting change as a member of our SCWRES project team."

It has been really challenging to hear from so many colleagues sharing personal experiences related to their race. For me, I\u2019m excited to be a part of this and to be one of 18 councils to trailblaze SCWRES in England. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, and hopefully will bring better awareness and support to race equality in social care for staff and service users."

We have recently held forums with colleagues across both children's services and adult social care, where we shared the draft action plan and gave colleagues an opportunity for them to share their reflections and experiences."

I will continue to listen and work with colleagues from the SCWRES project team, as well as wider services, and continue to raise awareness. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility to take ownership of this project to create long lasting change."

I came into this experience, not as the HR Manager for Adult Care Services, but as a member of the workforce ready and willing to learn and grow \u2013 as any other attendee. The forums had been attended by colleagues of all ethnic backgrounds and I felt that this gave the discussions a vibrant, enriched atmosphere. They showcased an interesting mix of experiences, thoughts and reflections which were refreshingly, sometimes brutally, honest."

Forums discussing the cultural and recruitment experience of staff from different ethnic backgrounds was particularly of interest as they promote active discussions in HR on how to improve our processes for staff."
