Data should underpin our policy and operational decisions and quantify the impact of our work.

Developing the Data Annex of the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) strategy has been a collaborative effort. DDaT\u2019s data teams and analysts have been working together on a data strategy for the whole department."
