Our People & Nature Survey data recorded that in January 2022, 90 per cent of adults in England reported they view green and natural spaces as good places for mental health and wellbeing. It\u2019s plain to see that the power of nature is essential for our health, and so Natural England, along with its partners, is on a mission to ensure that more people can access the healing properties of spending time in natural spaces through its Green Social Prescribing programme."

Across the country, there is a clear shift towards acknowledging the benefits that nature and green social prescribing plays in the recovery of mental ill health. That shift is evidenced by reviews such as those outlined within the reviewed journal Population Health, Science Direct:"

The project builds on the government\u2019s commitment to transform mental health services and increase social prescribing, set out in the NHS Long Term Plan.

The project is supported by a robust evaluation, which will help in learning lessons in order to be more confident in scaling up GSP nationally."
