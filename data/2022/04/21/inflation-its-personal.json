This is because, when compiling the costs of goods and services, RPI uses a different calculation method to CPIH. RPI also measures owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs differently. CPIH is generally accepted to be a more appropriate measure of inflation now than RPI."

Beyond 2030 the UK Statistics Authority has announced plans to bring the RPI methodology into line with CPIH. However, there is currently a judicial review of these plans so the market may be allowing for the possibility that the published\u00a0 changes are altered."

As such, inflation indices provide useful benchmarks, but specific inflationary pressures to certain users or industries should also be considered.
