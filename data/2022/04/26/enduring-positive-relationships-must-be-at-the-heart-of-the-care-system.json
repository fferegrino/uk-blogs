            "text": "We have known for some time that this is likely to be a watershed year for children\u2019s social care, as we await the outcome of the Care Review. The review has generated some fevered debate and, at times, some controversy. There has been no shortage of differing views about why there are shortfalls in the system and the solutions that will lead to improvement for children and families."

        {
            "text": "But there has been one issue that has broad agreement. Josh MacAlister, Chair of the Care Review, has been absolutely right to highlight that the care system too often fails to protect, develop and sustain the important relationships in the lives of looked after children and care leavers."

            "text": "Our \u2018Matching in foster care\u2019 research in 2020 found that more could be done to keep children in touch with previous foster carers who were important to them. More recently, our \u2018Ready or not\u2019 report highlighted how many care leavers felt alone or isolated when they left care. A third of care leavers told us that they did not know where to get help or support. These issues have profound and serious implications for children and young people."

As Mags succinctly put it, \u2018We need to place relationships front and centre of children\u2019s social care\u2019."

            "text": "It is a timely report and makes the important point that positive relationships and a sense of belonging cannot happen in isolation. The care system needs to provide stability and continuity for children and young people where they live, and where they learn or work. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, children need to stay close to the people who are important to them. They need access to effective support for their physical and emotional health when they need it. Children need help to understand their life stories."

        {
            "text": "But, as I and many others have said before, unless wider systemic issues are resolved, too many children and young people\u00a0will continue\u00a0to\u00a0live far from family and friends. Too many social workers will struggle to find time to work directly with children. Children and young people will continue to wait too long for help for their emotional health."

These include details on how inspections should address the quality of life-story work and the impact of lead members of children\u2019s services on corporate parenting. We do look at these areas during our inspections. But, we will look carefully at the recommendations, along with any that may be made in the upcoming Care Review, when considering how to improve our inspections \u2018in the round\u2019."

            "text": "This finding chimes with our own evidence that the independent visitor role benefits far too few children and young people. We have made this clear in our contributions to the Care Review. The level of attention given to independent visiting services can provide a strong indicator of the importance that local authorities place on children\u2019s relationships."

            "text": "Over several years, we\u2019ve seen that the priority given to the service varies significantly between local authorities, despite the legal duty to appoint an independent visitor when it\u2019s felt to be in a child\u2019s best interests. This is a real shame \u2013 an independent visitor can bring something different and hugely valuable to children. They lie outside the network of professionals that often surrounds children in care and care leavers."

            "text": "Another recommendation for Ofsted from the Spotlight Inquiry proposes that inspectors should assess a local authority\u2019s independent visiting services against the standards developed by the National Independent Visitor Network. While not legally enforceable, we agree that they are a useful benchmark for local authorities to consider when developing and monitoring their independent visitor services."

In particular, it describes why our inspectors are keen to see, and report on, that positive impact. It\u2019s an important part of our local authority inspections."
