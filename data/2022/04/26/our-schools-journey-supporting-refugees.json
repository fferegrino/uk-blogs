Chief Executive of The Dean Trust, Tarun Kapur, shares how Broadoak School in Manchester recently supported 60 young refugees and their families from Afghanistan. As children and young people from Ukraine begin to arrive in the country, Tarun shares his advice for schools looking to support refugees. "

They included cultural sensitivities, financial implications and emotional support, utilising the skills and compassion of a range of people in the organisation."

            "text": "We started by identifying staff from across our trust with the skills that were most needed, for example Pashto and Dari speakers who could act as interpreters. We also got in touch with our uniform suppliers and key partners who generously provided financial help and support in kind, for example coats for each child from the Manchester United Foundation. In the school canteen, we ensured there were always Halal options."

            "text": "In order to give our staff the tools they needed, we held training about the Afghan education system and how to create a supportive environment for refugees experiencing PTSD. The training was an opportunity to share relevant knowledge and skills as well as instil empathy and a greater understanding of the young people\u2019s challenging backgrounds. Staff learned to complement mental health services accessed outside of school by ensuring that, in the moment, Broadoak was a safe place where these young people could learn and regain hope for the future."

We also discussed cultural differences \u2013 for example we are a mixed sex school, which is not the norm in Afghanistan. Being able to converse with parents in their native language made a huge difference."

During this time, we assessed the students\u2019 subject levels in Pashto or Dari and in English. We introduced them to various multi-lingual resources to support their learning of English, drawing on support from one of our schools with a high level of students with English as an additional language. Getting students quickly involved in mainstream classes such as PE and drama helped them to integrate because they could easily participate despite initial language barriers."

            "text": "We also planned a series of extra-curricular activities to give the students the opportunity to take part in activities that British students enjoy, like visiting the cinema, an ice rink or a country park. It was amazing to see their reaction; the joy was clearly visible and the experiences helped the students relate to their new peers. We also planned cultural activities where other refugee students from our trust visited and took part in traditional dances and cricket."
