I eventually realised that not everyone thinks of killing themselves several times a week, and that what I was experiencing wasn\u2019t so common. For many years, I crawled on alone, until finally starting treatment in my late twenties."

Not in the sense that I was physically alone - I did hang out with friends and family, when I could muster the strength to pretend to be a functioning human being. However, I was always painfully aware of my isolation, and how I had to put in effort to engage in social interactions that seemed effortless for others. My feeling of alienation was enormous; I could see others merrily socialising, yet all I wanted to do was crawl back to my dark bedroom and stare at the ceiling."

How could I even try to make connections or confide in people about my feelings, if I knew there was something wrong with me? The internalised stigma and learned helplessness made any idea of seeking help seem pointless."

My message to anyone suffering from poor mental health is: support is available, and it\u2019s never too late. Good health is something you\u2019re entitled to. Just like you wouldn\u2019t ignore an open wound and bleed all over the floor, don't feel that poor mental health is something you must endure. Things can get better, and it may not take as much as you think.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Treatment also helped with the feeling of isolation and loneliness. A lot of the distance I used to perceive is actually just part of the normal human experience. Depression did make things worse, but there always is a gap between individuals that takes conscious effort to bridge and overcome. Every man actually is an island, we just tend to build bridges. So now if I avoid people, it\u2019s because I want to."
