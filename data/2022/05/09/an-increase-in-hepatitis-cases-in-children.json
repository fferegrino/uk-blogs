The viruses that normally cause hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A to E) have not been found in the children affected recently. Other possible causes of acute hepatitis, including some medications and toxins are also being investigated, however so far a link has not been found. The UK Health Security Agency is working with the NHS, a wide range of experts and with public health colleagues across the UK to find the cause as soon as possible."

One area being explored is whether the hepatitis cases are linked to an increase in infections caused by adenovirus, a common cause of childhood illness. Over the last two years children have been mixing less because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of this the number of common infections seen in children was reduced."

            "text": "Some of the children with acute hepatitis have recently had a COVID-19 infection, but there has been a high number of COVID-19 infections in this age group so this is not unexpected. There is no link between these hepatitis cases and the COVID-19 vaccine. None of the current cases aged under 10 years old in the UK is known to have been vaccinated."

Most of the children affected were previously healthy, and only a very small number of cases are linked to another case of hepatitis. This means that even if there has been a case in your family or friends, or if a case has occurred at your child\u2019s nursery or school, your child is still at low risk of developing hepatitis."

There are fewer than five older case-patients recorded as having had a COVID-19 vaccination prior to hepatitis onset."
