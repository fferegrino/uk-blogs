            "text": "As editor of the Civil Service Blog, I\u2019m regularly asked what makes a great blog post, so let\u2019s start with the basics. The goal for any blog is to write engaging content that holds your attention till the end. If you get bored reading it, chances are, so will everyone else. First up, consider your audience and what might captivate readers. People relate to authentic, real content - either because it\u2019s relevant, interesting or they\u2019ll learn something. So think about how you can hook people from the start.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Consider key challenges, news, campaigns, careers, events, experience or projects you can write about. Keep an eye out for hot topics in the Civil Service, e.g. Modernisation and Reform, the COVID-19 response, or ever-green topics such as How to Nail That Civil Service Interview. Listicles are hugely popular, e.g. 10 Reasons Why: You Must Tune into Civil Service Live, and can be adapted to almost any topic."

        },
        {
            "text": "Hook readers with an attention-grabbing headline that makes them want to read every word. Alliterative and punny headlines can work brilliantly, and a bit of effort is rarely wasted. For example, Civil Service Reform sounds pretty dry, but tweaking it to Civil Service Reform Revolution sounds a bit more exciting. Last year, I opened a draft titled Evaluation which didn\u2019t sound promising. It was swiftly turned into Don\u2019t Stagnate - Evaluate to Innovate!"

Known in the trade as the \u2018standfirst\u2019, this aims to sum up in a single snappy sentence the most interesting, insightful or colourful gems to hook readers. Look at the way newspapers present their intros and take your time, because it\u2019s what \u2018sells\u2019 the article and lets readers decide whether to read on or click away."

But if it sounds too soul-baring, then it probably strays over the line. Write like you\u2019re talking to a reader for a conversational vibe. But remember, all our bloggers are ambassadors for the Civil Service, so be professional.\u00a0\u00a0"

Our latest blog post always tops the blog homepage, so you need something eye-catching to breathe life into the words, and help explain the story. Take time to get your images right because we can\u2019t fix a blurry shot. It\u2019s your responsibility to provide three strong images which must be hi-res, jpg and landscape. When photographing people, your frame should capture from the head to the waist and leave plenty space above and to the sides, as this leaves a little leeway for cropping."

In a nutshell, take photos during the day, try and step outside into natural lighting and don\u2019t take it too close up. Government buildings can add a pop of location interest. Consider the background (greenery works well) and shoot from different angles for variety. Above all, avoid virtual meeting shots which rarely look anything other than blurry and dull."
