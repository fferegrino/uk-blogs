In its report, published on 31 March 2021, the Commission found aggregate terms like \u2018BAME\u2019 (black, Asian and minority ethnic) were no longer helpful. It recommended they\u00a0 should be dropped, advocating instead a focus on understanding disparities and outcomes - such as in education or health - for specific ethnic groups."

This sets out an action plan intended to tackle negative disparities, promote unity and build a fairer Britain for all. It also includes a commitment to no longer use the term \u2018BAME\u2019 in government. But why does this matter?\u00a0"
