            "text": "These plants are on coastal flood banks, which need to be able to withstand winter storms and high tides. Alexanders and Sea Beet grow vigorously, early in the growing season and prevent other species from establishing. If left uncut, these plants will seed and then die back in late summer leaving extensive areas of bare soil on the flood banks. To be able to withstand these weather circumstances, the banks need vegetation cover. Targeted cutting of these species helps because repeatedly cutting them weakens the plant and prevents it producing seed. Other species of wildflowers and grasses can then germinate and establish."

Our monitoring in 2021 found that as the summer progressed and other vegetation became established, the dominance of Alexanders and Sea Beet gradually reduced. As a result, we were able to reduce the extent of our targeted cutting."
