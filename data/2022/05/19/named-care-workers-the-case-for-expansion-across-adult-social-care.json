It\u2019s been suggested that every \u00a31 invested would anticipate a saving or costs avoided of \u00a35.14. Now, the initiative of having a named worker is being extended to other people who draw on care and support. A recent SCIE webinar covered this issue."

The worker knows that a person\u2019s background, values and requirements are unique.

The big question is how we can extend it beyond that. It\u2019s about developing the skills, confidence and leadership capabilities of named workers. This is a big step from traditional approaches to care management. Staff are likely to have concerns about the potential for a higher workload. In the webinar, a delegate asked how it\u2019s possible to have a named worker and, at the same time, manage sickness, absence and a lack of staffing in teams?"

            "text": "But the alternative is what we\u2019ve been hearing: that practice over time becomes task driven and case-management-led in its approach. There can be an obsession with risk management, a general poor understanding of the individual and a focus on tasks and protocols. Social work can be held back when these and other things are present."

We\u2019re hoping that, in widening the named worker focus more broadly than just learning disability and autism services, many more adults will receive care and support more appropriate and fine-tuned to their needs."
