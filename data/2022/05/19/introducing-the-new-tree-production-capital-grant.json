            "text": "Tree planting is a core part of the government agenda to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The government aims to at least treble tree planting rates in England and is committed to increasing planting across the UK to 30,000 hectares per year by the end of this parliament."

            "text": "The England Trees Action Plan outlined our commitment to increase sapling supply and build nursery capacity. To deliver this, we are providing funding to increase the domestic production of tree seed and saplings, with Forestry Commission shortly opening a new Tree Production Capital Grant. As planting rates go up, market demand for seed and saplings will increase, so this grant will help suppliers scale up and modernise their operations to meet a historic opportunity."

Any public, private, or third sector organisation who will use the funding to support their production of tree seed or saplings is encouraged to apply!"

To learn more about projects funded by the Tree Production Innovation Fund, read our blog."

And by increasing domestic supply we will boost our green economy and mitigate against the biosecurity risks associated with importing planting material."
