            "text": "Plants are vital for our health and the environment. They improve air quality, boost our mood, improve our resilience to climate change, and provide a home for wildlife. Many of the plants in our gardens and ponds are not native to Britain - they have been introduced from all over the world by people. While non-native plants can add much to a garden, some may become invasive causing problems in the garden and the wider environment. Although only a small minority of non-native plants become invasive, the impact they can have is extensive and may be irreversible."

            "text": "Some invasive plants quickly form dense stands crowding out native plants reducing the local plant diversity and affecting other species that rely on native plants for food or shelter. The highly endangered tansy beetle (left) was reduced to a single population when its sole food source, the native tansy plant, became rare, partly due to competition from invasive Himalayan balsam (right)."

Montbretia grows quickly outcompeting native species. Another introduced species, Hottentot fig (right), changes the soil conditions and nutrients, starving other plants."

The Spanish bluebell (right) hybridises with our native bluebell, an iconic woodland species, which could lead to the loss of the native plant."

            "text": "Invasive aquatic plants such as water primrose (left) and floating pennywort (right) are particularly problematic if they escape into a natural waterbody, clogging waterways and reducing oxygen availability in the water, and interfering with recreation, making it harder for us to take part in activities such as fishing, sailing or paddling."

Often complete eradication is impossible, and millions of pounds are spent each year to limit their spread. Local Action Groups across the country are helping to control invasive plants, find out how APHA staff have been involved in efforts to tackle floating pennywort in our recent blog."
