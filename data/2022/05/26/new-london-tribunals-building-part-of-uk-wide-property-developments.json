I knew that I would need to think carefully about our approach to our buildings to meet the bespoke needs of the justice system.\nOur priority during the pandemic was to keep justice going, but now that we\u2019ve emerged, it\u2019s time to reset our property development plans to make the best use of our existing buildings and open new ones."

It will provide around 30 hearing rooms that are flexible and capable of hearing a wide range of tribunal case types and we expect it to be operational by the end of 2023."
