Targeted screening focuses on smaller groups that have a heightened risk of a condition\u00a0 before screening. Population screening focuses on large demographically defined populations with a generally low level of risk."

The aim of this is to improve health outcomes\u2019."

Targeted and selective screening were found to be interchangeable. Cascade screening, while conceptually similar to targeted screening, was a term only used within the context of genetic diseases."
