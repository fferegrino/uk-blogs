We want a network of professionals who can establish a consistent approach to teaching and learning, assessment, and teacher development across our trust. With the introduction of the Early Career Framework (ECF), we saw NPQs as an opportunity to really integrate our CPD."

            "text": "Rather than focusing only on new teachers and their CPD, we wanted to broaden the experience of developing teachers across our workforce \u2013 not just those at the outset of their careers. The ECF works alongside NPQs in helping us do that, giving opportunities for experienced teachers to take on the mentorship of early career teachers and develop their leadership skills that way."

The funding designated to the programmes means that more teachers and leaders than ever before can access qualifications. At RISE, we are seizing this opportunity to supplement trust-wide CPD programmes and replace some external programmes which may not be as cost-effective or time-efficient."

The qualifications allow time for professionals to network with other teachers and leaders around the country to share best practice. It\u2019s a great opportunity for the profession to develop by ensuring research is interwoven in our practice."
