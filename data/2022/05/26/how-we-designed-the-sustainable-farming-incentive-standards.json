In the past we have been focused on prescribing how a moor should be managed without clearly setting out what success looks like environmentally. Secondly, every moor is different. Each has a unique mix of habitats and growing conditions. Neighbouring moors can have very different stock carrying capacity. A \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach is difficult to justify.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is why our approach to designing standards has been centred around co-design. We have been working with farmers and land managers throughout the standard development process to make sure that the standards are simple to understand, feasible to achieve, and that they address the environmental issues and opportunities that are important to us.\u00a0"
