            "text": "In Cumbria, managing and reducing flood risk remains a key focus for Eden Rivers Trust \u2013 and trees do help reduce flood risk. Rain hits the ground at higher speeds where there is a lack of tree cover, whilst a canopy of leaves, branches and trunks slows down the rain before it hits the ground simply by getting in the way (interception) and slowing its route to the ground and running off into the river. Some of the water will evaporate back into the atmosphere directly from the canopy without ever reaching the ground."

            "text": "Root systems also help water penetrate deeper into the soil at a faster rate under and around trees. This means less surface run-off and more water storage in the soil and that can help slow the flow of water which in turn take the peak off the flood downstream."

One third of all woodland wildlife species are in decline and one in 10 woodland wildlife species are at risk of extinction (Woodland Trust, 2021). We know we need more trees and planting a young sapling, or a whip, is one of the most compelling and satisfying things we can do in the world of conservation land management. But we cannot just plant trees."

            "text": "Peat is formed by dead vegetation that is unable to fully decompose in the waterlogged environment, thereby locking up carbon. Globally, the carbon stored in peat is estimated to be twice that found in forests and whilst both are important, the absence of tree cover from the bog system ensures peat forming sphagnum mosses can thrive. The UK Forestry Standard framework provides further advice on tree planting, urging that new woodland design consider the site\u2019s landscape, suitability, environmental, economic, and social factors."

            "text": "The right species of tree in the right place reduces the chance that pests, diseases, natural disasters and other threats can make a drastic impact on a habitat or area. For example, take the current loss we face from the threat of ash dieback disease: we are set to lose around 80% of ash trees in the UK, and this will have a devastating impact on the landscape and the species that rely on the tree. To mitigate some of the damage, we need to plant (or encourage natural regeneration of) other species of trees not impacted by the disease to replace the role of ash in the ecosystem."
