As a headteacher, I can see the wide range of issues that affect children\u2019s regular attendance. Often these are complex issues affecting the whole family, with some of the most serious being financial concerns, homelessness or housing insecurity, and in some instances alcohol and substance abuse.\u00a0\u00a0"

Through our partnership with our local Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) partnership, we have identified a number of local charities who were best suited to helping us tackle some of these root causes to persistent absence.\u00a0"

By providing space for staff to undertake this work, we can ensure we are giving back to the community and our children can see the important link between school, home and their local area. There is still a long way to go yet on our attendance journey but this way of working could prove effective in the long run. If we harness the power of our communities and place-based organisations then we can, I believe, address some of the intractable issues that we face in schools. \u00a0"
