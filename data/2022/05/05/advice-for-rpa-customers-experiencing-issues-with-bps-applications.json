This screen displays the information that will be used to create the BPS application and any changes made on the land use screen will not be included in the BPS application until it has been opened."

If there is an error, this can usually be corrected by over-writing the information directly into the \u2018Applied for\u2019 column."

This is a warning that the activated area declared for the parcel is greater than its BPS eligible area and that this needs to be corrected before the application can be submitted.\u00a0 This can normally be done by checking the information entered for the land parcel on the \u2018land-use\u2019 screen and either correcting that information or reducing the declared area to match the correct eligible area of the parcel in the \u2018Activate less BPS area\u2019 screen."

This is being corrected on the system but, while this is being done, any customer encountering this error can normally correct it by deleting and re-entering the relevant information on the \u2018land-use\u2019 screen (in some cases, it may be necessary to do this more than once) and then re-opening the \u2018Activate less BPS area\u2019 screen to ensure the information carries over into the application."
