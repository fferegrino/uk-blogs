The Buying for Schools team has pulled together a set of DfE-approved frameworks that could lead to lower costs for schools, but how can schools identify the areas that may lead to the biggest financial savings and, more importantly, how can they assess whether seeking to negotiate a new contract would be worth it?"

VMFI provides financial information quickly and in an easy-to-understand format, offering a tailored visual interface to quickly identify areas to investigate by offering comparisons with 30 of the most similar schools. The ultimate aim of VMFI is to make it far easier for users to examine the financial position of their school or trust by providing this automated assessment of their data and a set of helpful starting points to investigate from."

By identifying these potential areas for improvement, VMFI is able to identify commercial recommendations from across the DfE and suggest various frameworks that might be considered by users. \u00a0An example of how this would be displayed is in the image below:"

We simply aim to provide you with the information to make your own decisions."
