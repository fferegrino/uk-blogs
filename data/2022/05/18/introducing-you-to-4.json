We receive lots of requests for information from third parties, so it\u2019s important we follow the legislation correctly and don\u2019t release any of our customers\u2019 personal data."

            "text": "My work in the Information Rights Team is interesting and challenging, and no case is the same. We investigate each request to establish exactly what it relates to, if the information is held and, if so, which area of RPA will address it. We identify which piece of legislation the request falls under and commission it to the appropriate individual or team. When we\u2019ve received the required information, we establish if it can be released under the legislation or not. We then formulate a response to the requestor, either providing the information or explaining why it can\u2019t be released."

I started as an Administrative Assistant in Livestock, which seems a very long time ago now! I\u2019ve also worked as a processor on legacy schemes, the Single Payment Scheme, the Basic Payment Scheme, Countryside Stewardship and as a Complaint Resolution Officer. I particularly enjoyed completing service reviews when I worked in Customer Resolution. It was very rewarding when I was able to resolve issues and support our customers."
