I know many of you had a lot of questions about how the scheme would work, and I hope we\u2019re now in better position to answer these."

There are many drivers that have always been able to tow without taking the B+E test and we know that many of them would benefit from professional, accredited training. So, if you have any other ways to signpost the scheme to motorists, including any of your former pupils, that will help us to raise awareness with existing trailer users."
