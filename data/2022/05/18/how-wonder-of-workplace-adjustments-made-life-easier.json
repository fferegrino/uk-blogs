I was terrified that the confusion I expected to feel in the classroom would take me right back to being a teenager in school. I left school convinced I was rubbish at English and would never be able to understand it."

Two years ago, I wrote about how assistive software made a profound\u00a0 difference to life at work. Two years on, it\u2019s time to update my story. I am now very proud to say that assistive software is helping me fulfil my ambitions in other areas of my life too.\u00a0"

I was absolutely blown away and expected someone to tell me it's all a joke. I\u2019m so happy my adjustments have given me the tools to really showcase my skills and fulfil my potential.\u00a0"

I have an agreement with my teacher to add any material that we cover during the lesson to the classroom online platform.

I still use Claroread to read emails and documents as well as \u2018speak as I type\u2019 when I am creating documents or replying to emails; this allows me to consciously craft as I write, such as I\u2019ve done for this blog post. Sonocent Audio Notetaker records meetings, allowing me to fully engage without the anxiety of missing key content. (This software has some privacy challenges in my role, but these are easily mitigated.) Finally, Mindview supports me with planning my work - it allows me to map out in a visual spider graph format, bringing clarity out of the fog of my often confused mind."

            "text": "Assistive software is a game changer for some colleagues who need workplace adjustments. However in my experience, they generally cannot be used in isolation, but as a supplement to other adjustments. If you think that assistive software could help you, talk to your manager about the workplace adjustments you might need. You will need to complete a Workplace Adjustment Passport which is available on departmental websites. You can also seek advice through the Civil Service Disability Network and Civil Service Dyslexia and Dyspraxia Network."
