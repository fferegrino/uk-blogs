            "text": "Since it was founded in 2014, Policy Lab\u2019s mission has been to explore the cutting edge of policy design practice: to radically improve policymaking through design, innovation and people-centred approaches. Back then, applying design thinking to a policy challenge was a very new and different way to frame, research and solve policy problems. Today these methods have been adopted way beyond our team. User centred design, service design and systems thinking are now part of the latest Policy Professions Standards and there are teams across the civil service pursuing these methods.\u00a0"

The last one is blank because our horizon scanning work for policymaking is an ongoing process and we expect to discover more new methods."

            "text": "Some of these methods, like serious games, are already gaining ground in a policy context - we\u2019ve included them because we think they have the potential to be used more widely across government. For example, Policy Lab worked with the Maritime Autonomous Regulation Lab (MARLab) during 2019 and 2020 to develop a serious game that explored the future of maritime regulation.\u00a0"

For example Formula One uses digital twins to identify opportunities for improvement and efficiency using data.

As we start to introduce them in our work, we are excited to see what we will learn about how the policy system could adopt these approaches. We hope some, if not all, of the methods might make it into the Policy Profession Standards of the future. As Matthew Syed said in his book, Rebel Ideas: there was once a time when adding wheels to a suitcase seemed absurd.\u00a0"
