Today we have published the last in our monthly series of data releases for March 2022 specifically looking at the impact of the pandemic. We now have a valuable set of data to analyse, helping to show the changes in the way we engaged with nature as the country navigated lockdowns and the easing of restrictions.\u00a0\u00a0"

This includes things like listening to birdsong and noticing butterflies.\u00a0"

The People and Nature Survey has revealed that for many people, spending time outside in nature is not always easy.\u00a026% of adults surveyed said they had not spent any time in green and natural spaces in the previous 14 days (March 2022). This was higher for people from lower income households (37%, income less than \u00a315,000, March 2022) suggesting that existing inequalities in accessing nature were not negated.\u00a0"

The type and quality of local green space was dependent on where you lived. For people who lived in towns and cities, this often-meant places such as parks or playing fields, with 48% of people who spent time outdoors visiting an urban green space (March 2022).\u00a0"

Amid the anxiety and endless video calls of the early days of pandemic, getting out into nature on a daily basis was essential for my wellbeing. Looking back from 2022, I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to connect with the nature on my doorstep. Living on the edge of Bristol, I explored footpaths within a couple of miles of my house that I had never used before. With some of these paths having become firm favourites, I try to spend more time in nature and continue to go for regular walks from home as we come out of the pandemic.\u00a0"
