            "text": "Before joining LAA Digital, I worked in the Higher Education sector teaching Computer Science at a Midlands University. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d planned or aspired to, but I fell in love with the role and the opportunity to shape the lives of future generations. I put in countless hours to ensure marking was finished on time and frequently gave up weekends to help run open days and events. However, this all changed during the pandemic."

            "text": "The transition to online learning was relatively well managed, and I was determined to ensure the students still had the best experience, so I invested in a green screen and professional camera. However, with more to do than ever before, and the demands of the role continuing to increase, eventually\u2026 I burnt out."

            "text": "The passion and motivation I\u2019d had were gone, but it took a while for me to acknowledge this as I\u2019d always prided myself on my mental fortitude and work ethic. I talked to friends and family, who were extremely supportive, and I began to ask myself - Is this really what I want?"

        {
            "text": "I\u2019d entered HE thinking it would be the perfect role to continue my personal development. Ironically, when you\u2019re spending all your time preparing material and marking work, there isn\u2019t a lot of time left over for learning. I eventually came to the conclusion that software development is my true passion, having enjoyed creating new assignments or problem sets for students, times when I could really get my hands dirty."

            "text": "However, I had trouble letting go. I felt responsible for the students in my care and the teaching material I\u2019d developed. How could I leave all of this behind? Was I good enough? Would anyone want to hire me? Then, personal tragedy struck. I lost a dear friend in a motorcycle accident at the age of 28. Even now almost a year on, I\u2019m still not sure if I\u2019ve fully come to terms with his passing. He always lived life to the fullest, and it gives me great solace knowing that he died doing something he loved. He made me realise that life is too short to spend it being unhappy, so I began job hunting and eventually, something caught my eye."

So I buried my doubts and applied for the position. I\u2019ve been with LAA Digital for around 7 months now and am content to say It\u2019s everything I hoped it would be, and more!"

I\u2019m routinely utilising modern tools and technologies, my technical knowledge continues to reach new heights, and I\u2019m contributing to something valuable. They also emphasise the importance of feedback with fortnightly surveys and opportunities for teams to meet the senior management team, who genuinely want LAA Digital to be the best place to work."

Right now, our main focus is centred around modernisation, and migrating large parts of our legacy estate via the development of new microservices, allowing us to take advantage of modern technologies and tooling. Some of our software is decades old, so it\u2019s exciting to be involved in these efforts, which will undoubtedly improve the experience of our stakeholders when applying for legal aid."
