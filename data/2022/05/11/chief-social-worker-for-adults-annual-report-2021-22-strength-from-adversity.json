Social workers and social care and health colleagues continue to help individuals and families process the disruption, loss and trauma of the last two and half years. Now of course, they will be contending with the stresses of the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine, both of which exact a mental and physical toll, even on those not directly affected."

He is working hard with the MHA Reform team and stakeholders to strengthen the approved mental health professional (AMHP) workforce \u2013 an often unseen bastion of brilliance!"

In the darkest days of the pandemic, I am so glad the adult social work profession had the benefit of the collective wisdom of not one, but two Chief Social Workers, Fran Leddra and Mark Harvey."

Social work \u2013 and social care generally \u2013 can only be truly effective if it mirrors the society it serves."
