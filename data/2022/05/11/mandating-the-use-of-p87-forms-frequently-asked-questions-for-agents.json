            "text": "We receive a wide variety of employment expense claim forms from repayment agents. We are bringing in the new P87 form so we have a consistent standard coming into HMRC. This will allow us to process these applications more efficiently and will allow us to start automating the processing of P87s. For automation to work, all forms need to be the same so our systems can scan them and identify the necessary information. This will help us to pick up and process any repayments and coding adjustments more quickly."

Applications received in a non-prescribed form will not be processed.\nThe repayment agent will receive a letter explaining this and advising that the prescribed P87 form must be used.
