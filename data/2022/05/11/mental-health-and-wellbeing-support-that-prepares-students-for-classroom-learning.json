The senior leaders in our school are determined that we meet the primary needs of children, which means our mental health and wellbeing provision is as carefully considered as our academic offer. It\u2019s important to us that our staff understand and respect the community we serve, so that children are not shoehorned into classroom success without addressing their primary needs."

With our team of learning mentors, we also work weekly with our primary mental health worker, play therapist, family support worker, counsellor and CAW attendance officer. The positive impact of this provision is widely recognised; our staff and children are proud of what they achieve together with their key professional and their families."

On their entry to KS1, a group of six to eight children receive two hours of teaching each morning from an accredited Nurturing Schools Programme Teacher. As children \u2018graduate\u2019 from this phase having met their SEMH targets, they are prepared for classroom learning and the best possible start to Year 1."

For children transitioning to KS2, our afternoon provision promotes social communication. It can lead to rapid progress in the classroom, reduced incidents of unsafe behaviour and a culture that acknowledges the importance of prioritising mental wellbeing. Children feel valued here at Whitehawk, with 97% of children reporting that they feel safe at school and 94% reporting that they feel a sense of belonging."

Ultimately, we have one piece of advice: your whole organisation has to believe in the impact of meaningful, well designed and well delivered SEMH provision. If colleagues from every team subscribe to the ethos of \u2018meeting the child\u2019s primary needs\u2019 we can achieve a culture of respect for mental health and wellbeing."
