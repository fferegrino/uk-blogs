To initiate an investigation, we first need evidence from a UK industry, both that imports are dumped or subsidised and that they are harming UK business.\u00a0You can see the detail in our guidance on how we carry out investigations.\u00a0 "

In markets where prices are not public, you may not know the exact price at which an overseas competitor is winning business from you, for example. So where an overseas competitor is undercutting your prices, we need the best available intelligence available to you to help us establish whether we can initiate a case.\u00a0"

            "text": "We have prescribed calculations and analyses we then have to conduct during a case. If we have an allegation of dumping, we have to be able to demonstrate that the price overseas businesses are selling at in the UK is less than the price they charge customers at home. Clearly, we need to ensure we are making a fair comparison, so if the domestic price is distorted \u2013 for example by government intervention in the market for energy as we have seen in some cases \u2013 we need to be able to adjust that price to what it would be if it was set in a competitive market. The more information we have the better. Why should we believe that a market is distorted? What would a price set in open markets without distortions be? All insights into these questions will help us reach more robust conclusions. We check all the supporting evidence collated and is consistent with the law and the requirements of the WTO.\u00a0"

This is not a measurable fact but a matter of judgement. But we need credible evidence. We verify the facts provided and test the assumptions underlying the numbers.\u00a0\u00a0"

A wide range of good evidence we can trust, robustly analysed, is the best foundation for that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
