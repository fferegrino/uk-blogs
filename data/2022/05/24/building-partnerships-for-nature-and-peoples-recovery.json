On an individual level, one in four adults and one in 10 children experience mental illness. The government has recently published a call for evidence to inform a new 10-year mental health plan to level up mental health across the country and put mental and physical health on an equal footing. At Natural England, we understand the role that connecting people with nature can play to support happy and healthy people in thriving, natural settings."

            "text": "The positive link between a connection to nature and good physical and mental health is supported by years of scientific study. I recently visited the Wild Being project in Reading funded by the Thriving Communities Programme. The project supported an extensive programme of arts, culture, nature, physical activity and life advice for 300 people including pop up arts, English language conversations, and gardening. At the event I was reminded of a study from 1984 (incidentally the year I was born), which reported that people can recover from surgery or deal with pain more effectively, if exposed to a natural environment. Viewing nature alone can aid in the path to recovery (Ulrich RS, 1984)."

            "text": "While we know that the evidence is strong on the links between nature and health, a cross-government and cross-sector approach is needed to realise the potential. That\u2019s why Natural England is championing green social prescribing (GSP), which is the practice of supporting people to engage with nature-based interventions and activities to improve their mental health. Nature provides inspiration and a foundation from which we can re-build our own sense of self and connection, on our terms."

Partners from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), NHS England, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), Sport England and the National Academy for Social Prescribing, as well as a host of local community and health partners, came together. We discussed how we can scale up GSP and ensure it meets the needs of individuals facing inequalities in health and access to the natural environment."

This event was a major milestone for the national GSP pilot and a testament to the successful collaboration of the cross-government partnership and local delivery."
