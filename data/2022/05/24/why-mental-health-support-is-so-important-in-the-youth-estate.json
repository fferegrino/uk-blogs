She shares why understanding the role of trauma and creating a safe, mental health-informed environment can be game-changing for youth offenders. Alongside proven mental health-boosters like access to sports and a library, Feltham\u2019s staff take the time to understand every boy\u2019s story \u2013 with the hope of stopping the cycle of offending."

This makes it more likely that young people will struggle to assess danger accurately and therefore engage in high-risk, reckless, or self-destructive behaviours (e.g. carrying weapons) as a way to feel safe, which inadvertently results in the cycle of offending behaviour continuing.\u201d"
