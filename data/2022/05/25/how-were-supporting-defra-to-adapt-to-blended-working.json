            "text": "For many colleagues, this means working some of the time in a Defra group workplace, and some of the time from home, where this is possible and practical. For this approach to work though, a system needs to be in place that will enable Defra to combine the benefits of face-to-face interaction and collaboration, with the flexibility of working in a virtual way."

            "text": "So, it feels good to have contributed to that, not least because ultimately, it\u2019s giving our people choice. Being able to choose the best way of working and the right workspace for you, when you need it, whilst at the same time reducing the inflexibility of having fixed allocated areas which may not always be occupied, is more efficient for people and organisations."
