For example, vulnerable or intimidated witnesses can record their evidence before the full trial and away from the courtroom, through the pre-recorded cross examination special measure (section 28). We play the recording during the live trial, helping to make the experience less distressing for the person involved. It also means they don\u2019t have to wait for the trial to present their evidence."
