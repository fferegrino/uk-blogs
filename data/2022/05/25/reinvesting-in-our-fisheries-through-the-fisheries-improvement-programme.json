Over the past 12 months, more than \u00a33.5 million has been invested through FIP, funding more than 100 projects, including habitat conservation to protect fish species and boost stocks, and improving accessibility by creating new fishing platforms, pathways and car parking."

As a snapshot, since FIP was established, we have completed around 850 projects across the length and breadth of the country, with \u00a36 million invested from fishing licence sales alone."

We are delighted to have received \u00a32.9M in total match funding this year. It is also great to recognise that over the last 5 years we estimate the amount of match funding has been in the region \u00a311.5M. Therefore, the total value of our investment has more than tripled, delivering significantly more benefits for fish and for our local anglers!"
