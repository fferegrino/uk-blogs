He often spoke of his joy working collaboratively with humble, entrepreneurial, and talented people to serve the public. This, of course, filled me with the desire to work alongside such people myself. Furthermore, I thought it\u2019d be great to be involved in something that facilitates social mobility and stimulates diversity of thought in government, by creating opportunities for disadvantaged people."

I landed on my feet here, surrounded by lovely people that wanted the best for me. As my time at university was spent studying data science, my workplace mentor and supportive line manager were keen on exposing me to opportunities to continue learning about data science at work. This led me to collaborate with the Data Products team in GDS, and the rest, as they say, is history!\u00a0"

Constant exposure to challenge and innovation at work creates this unscratchable itch to keep learning. So let your workplace be your university. Look out bravely upon the fog of mystery and let it be the greatest teacher you ever had."
