There\u2019s so much knowledge in the heads of the people we work with, and through developing our own training it helps us to share that in a way that\u2019s tailored to the work we do and the context we work in, filling knowledge gaps and creating consistency where useful."

            "text": "Beyond knowledge sharing, designing and delivering training can also allow you to receive feedback and iterate your work or methods, and make valuable connections across government. Others may even come to perceive you as an expert when it comes to a specific craft or space, and ultimately this can help build your confidence in your own practice and further develop your career."

            "text": "There are even benefits to offering training beyond your discipline. By opening up training to others there is a greater chance that you will learn from different perspectives or approaches which can help you develop your own practice. It can also help to build understanding about how other disciplines work and what they can offer, which makes working together even better."

There were also talks about applying user-centred design practices and its impact within a department. These workshops were open to anyone with an interest, and more than 2,500 people attended which goes to show how much people value learning from their peers and other disciplines \u2013 you can read about the week\u2019s activities.\u00a0"

Not only did I share my understanding of those features\u2019 methodologies and functionalities with others; I also learned some neat tricks myself, and gained empathy for those not familiar with using Figma. Although I ran those sessions, I\u2019m constantly learning about the tool itself and will be sharing what I learn as I go.\n\nIf you haven't run training before it can seem a bit stressful \u2013 that\u2019s okay. I was nervous when I did my first Figma workshop, so I did a dry run beforehand with one person. Starting with one or 2 people can help you get a feel for it, get feedback on what worked and what didn\u2019t go exactly as you envisioned and build your confidence to run the session with a larger group."
