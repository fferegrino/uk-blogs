However, any lawyer will agree that the passing of legislation is rarely the end of the story \u2013 things need tightening up and adjusting as the regulations make their first encounter with real life. Accordingly, the\u202fTrade Remedies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations\u202f2022 came into force on 3 May 2022."

Applications to us to open an investigation are confidential, so if we had ever got to this point, there would have been an interesting balancing act for us as an Authority."

The changes will give us the powers to run a review to exempt parties from the circumvention measures if the circumvention review was completed before the measure was transitioned into UK law."

Bike companies which currently pay the anti-dumping duty on parts they import from the People\u2019s Republic of China will need to show us that they are not circumventing the duty. In practice, we\u2019ll need evidence that they are not related to a company that is currently subject to the duty and that the bikes they make are either made with less than 60% by value Chinese parts or, where the bikes are made of more than 60% parts from China, that the value added to the parts is greater than 25% of the manufacturing costs."
