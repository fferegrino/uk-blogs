Before that, I\u2019d spent my whole life thinking that I just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough - that I was annoying because I talked too much or lazy because I couldn\u2019t get things done.

That\u2019s when I heard about Right to Choose. This gave me the freedom to choose who provided my assessment, as long as they had a contract with the NHS somewhere in the UK. It significantly reduced the wait time to see a psychiatrist.\u00a0A relatively short 5 months later I had my assessment and received my diagnosis."

I make sure I set it for an achievable amount of focus time and when I\u2019m done, I reward myself!\u00a0 This is usually some time outside, because research shows that breaks in nature are particularly beneficial. This is called \u2018green time\u2019."
