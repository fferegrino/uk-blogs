The campaign is owned by the Mental Health Foundation which states that prevention is at the heart of its work. In a time where mental health problems are sadly the leading cause of sickness absence in the UK, preventing work-related wellbeing issues needs to be a priority for all organisations."

This week the mental health first aid group is hosting a workplace wellbeing session to discuss mental health and how the office can improve its support. We\u2019re also hosting an onsite \u2018Coffee Connect\u2019. This is an initiative that offers staff the chance to pair up with a random colleague they may not have met to help people make new friends and build meaningful connections with one another."

I applied for the role because poor mental health is something I\u2019ve experienced myself, particularly after I lost a family member through suicide. I was keen to use my experiences to help IPO create and maintain an environment where mental health is discussed openly, something we\u2019ve made great strides towards in recent years. It\u2019s great to be a part of an organisation that is so passionate about supporting colleagues who are struggling."

Clients can personalise this service, opting for a one-off session or book regular appointments - whatever suits them best. Our counsellors also lead and advise the mental health first aider group, supporting them through difficult scenarios or working together to record any trends that may crop up amongst staff."
