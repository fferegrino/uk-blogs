The variety of queries was a little daunting at first, but the team around me were supportive and the culture meant there was less emphasis on knowing the answer and more on knowing where to find it. This was my first Civil Service job and it helped me understand the breadth of technology that DWP uses. \u00a0"

I championed the in-built accessibility features and hosted workshops on things like voice-over and switch control. I think this experience combined with my time as a tech support manager helped me get my current role in infrastructure engineering. \u00a0"
