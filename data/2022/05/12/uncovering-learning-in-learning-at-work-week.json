Yet there\u2019s still more we need to do to improve ourselves, the 450,000 plus workforce responsible for some of the most important challenges of our time! The Declaration on Government Reform committed to change that, with specific goals in leadership, early talent (the Fast Stream and apprenticeships), and establishing the Government Campus for skills.\u00a0"

You\u2019ll hear directly from the people involved in designing and developing training products and programmes."

I looked at the last 30 years of leadership development, including the different programmes offered at the National School of Government. I looked at the evolution of the Fast Stream programme, and its huge growth, from 300 people in 2013 to 2,000 now. All of the changes made sense in isolation and in context, but no-one had ever tried to define a meaningful, specific curriculum for the whole Civil Service - and use that to provide assurance and consistency in all the places where people learnt their trades.\u00a0"
