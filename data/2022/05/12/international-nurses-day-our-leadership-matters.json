            "text": "In my role as Chief Nurse for Adult Social Care, I would be failing in my duty if I did not emphasise, encourage and otherwise extol the virtue of social care nurses as professional leaders. We are every bit the equal of our brilliant NHS counterparts, with the broadest of skill sets, lived and professional experience, and a tireless drive to do the very best for people in our care."

            "text": "There remains, however, a cultural and institutional gap between perception and reality \u2013 a gap I am determined to close. The recent government investment in training, continuous professional development and the opening up of new career pathways (including making it easier for nurses to move between NHS and care service roles) is very welcome, but we need a wholesale cultural shift to make the most of this funding."

I want to go further. I want to see the entire social care nursing profession achieve registration \u2013 and make our value to the health and care system official at all levels."

            "text": "It demonstrates our expertise in a critical area of nursing, and one not exclusive to our equally skilled NHS colleagues. Reducing infection risks, limiting or preventing disease outbreaks \u2013 not just coronavirus \u2013 is a real benchmark of our effectiveness. Indeed, by creating champions within individual care settings, this is another way we demonstrate leadership, share learning and evolve IPC practice to keep everyone safe."

I have long advocated for a strong evidence base to demonstrate the value social care nursing brings to the sector \u2013 we need to prove what works to advocate its adoption elsewhere in the system."

            "text": "Likewise, the Chief Nurse for Adult Social Care Awards, shine a light on exceptional colleagues leading the way in person-centred, empathic care. Leadership, in this sense, is not about control, but about inspiring others. It\u2019s also my way of proving to award recipients \u2013 and those around them \u2013 that what they do really matters. The best care colleagues transform lives for the better and, in the case of their colleagues, unlock their potential to transform many more."
