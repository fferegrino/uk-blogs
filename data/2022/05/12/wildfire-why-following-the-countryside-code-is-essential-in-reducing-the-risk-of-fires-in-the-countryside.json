The term conjures up images of raging fires and smouldering forests, something we would usually expect to see on television from international news stations, caused by freak weather events. Unfortunately, so-called wildfires are all too common in England as well, but here they are often caused by people and are rarely natural events. The damage caused by these fires in the countryside and parks can be devastating and the areas affected can take years to recover. Firefighting and recovery costs run into millions of pounds, including regenerating habitats and helping the species lost from those sites to repopulate."

            "text": "Some of the biggest risks of wildfires here in England come from a lack of understanding of how our behaviour can affect our natural spaces. Portable BBQs, campfires and cigarette butts can contribute to wildfire. In 2020 alone Natural England staff recorded a staggering 42 wildfires on Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI\u2019s) with a combined area of 773 hectares of National Nature Reserve (NNR) sites being burnt."

The Reserve lies in an area where peat used to be extracted for horticulture and despite our restoration work there are still areas of dry peat which are particularly vulnerable to fire.\u00a0 In May and June 2020, parts of the reserve were devastated by wildfires that burned for more than 10 days, damaging important habitat and wildlife, forcing closure to visitors and threatening important infrastructure."

The experience of wildfire is like no other; there are fronts, firefights, drones and helicopters. Thankfully, due to the immense professionalism of the Fire and Rescue Services there were no human casualties, and nobody\u2019s home was damaged. Afterwards, shell-shocked, we were left to count the cost."

They won\u2019t have seen the flames, that the little bit of smoulder in the peat which their BBQ may have caused, went on to ignite. They didn\u2019t smell the thick smoke that hung in the air. They didn\u2019t hear the crackling of the flames or feel the heat of that destructive force. They didn\u2019t witness what the hundreds of firefighters from Yorkshire, Humberside, Derbyshire and beyond saw and what they did. They weren\u2019t aware of the tears shed by grown men rescuing an orphan deer from the flames."

We had a wildfire that burnt across about 500 hectares of internationally important bog habitat, damaging about half of that area. It killed or damaged the habitat of a wide range of reptiles, birds and other wildlife. Some areas of peat were completely burnt away leaving permanent scars. The fire also led to the release of at least 160k tonnes CO2eq, which is equivalent to the annual greenhouse emissions of at least 30,000 people. It\u2019s hard to quantify the mental damage and stress that the incident caused too. For all of us that were involved in the battle, our neighbours, whose properties were at risk at the peak of the fire, and for all of those who care about the fantastic landscape and wildlife of the Humberhead Peatlands NNR; the impact was huge.

Those that may have lit a BBQ that day were as desperate as the rest of us for some relief from lockdown. But if everyone followed the Countryside Code and took time to read the signs when arriving at a site, there would be peace and the NNR would have been spared its scars that year.\u201d"
