This is partly due to the nature of the job - it\u2019s emotive and it\u2019s impossible not to give 100% of yourself every single day. The emotional weight that comes with that can sometimes be heavy."

We are incredibly lucky in this country to have an army of education staff who are dedicated, compassionate and will always do their very best for the children and the families that they serve. We must therefore celebrate them!"
