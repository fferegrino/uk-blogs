My current role is now more strategic which means I\u2019m in meetings most of the time, so it was a welcome change to take part in a local volunteering event to help clear floating pennywort weeds that are taking over the waterways (see distribution map)."

The NNSS leads the Check Clean Dry and Be Plant Wise campaigns in partnership with a wide range of other organisations, to raise awareness of the impacts of invasive non-native species, and how people can help to prevent their spread. Once established, invasive non-native species can be extremely difficult and costly to control, but across GB there is a network of Local Action Groups helping to manage of a number of invasive plants. Volunteers include APHA staff, who are helping to tackle floating pennywort."

I even roped my family in to help! We joined local residents and colleagues from APHA and Dittons Paddle Boarding and Walton Canoe and Camping clubs to haul large rafts of pennywort that were blocking the river."

            "text": "Large clumps of pennywort were collected on kayaks or paddleboards or dragged from the river onto the bankside using ropes, rakes, tarpaulin and lots of heaving. It was hard work and very muddy, but we all felt very satisfied at the end of the day when we saw the amount we had cleared, and the improvement in the water flow. This was the fourth volunteering event held along the river and it\u2019s a constant battle to stay on top of this fast-growing invasive plant. There are lots of other problems impacting the environment so there is a concerted effort coming up to address these issues during Invasive Species Week."
