Exploration can come in the shape of Proof of Concepts (PoC), Proof of Values (PoV) or Pilots, with each type of initiative differing slightly in terms of how widely the technology solution is tested. These initiatives are usually designed to be short-term, timeboxed pieces of work, with limited budgets to test and understand if a proposed technology solution has potential."

            "text": "Due to being light-touch and aimed at getting a steer on the big questions rather than answering every question there may be, explorations do not have to go through our formal project process ,and instead go through a shorter, more flexible Technology Innovation governance workflow."

In this opportunity we are using AR as a training tool for junior members of staff, enabling experienced colleagues to provide AR-driven training guides that the learner can use to learn in-situ and on the job. The benefit of this work is saved costs in technician callouts and effective interactive training being accessible 24/7."

This initiative will place a chatbot on Defra\u2019s internal Content Cloud service \u2013 guiding users through the service, instantly answering their questions and proactively providing helpful reminders and tips. It is expected that this virtual assistant will provide beneficial guidance for thousands of Content Cloud users and result in a better, more efficient service for the department."

The Technology Innovation team achieved this through creating a realistic model of the Foss Barrier in virtual reality, demonstrating the valuable ability to investigate, examine and discuss assets before they are built. It is believed this approach could enable significant savings in building and maintenance costs of large structures across Defra."

These initiatives include Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity, to enable automated monitoring in remote areas, IoT to monitor and proactively notify of potential felling in trees, and Virtual Reality to support Blended Working. We're looking forward to completing these explorations and seeing what other challenges and ideas colleagues present to us throughout the year."
