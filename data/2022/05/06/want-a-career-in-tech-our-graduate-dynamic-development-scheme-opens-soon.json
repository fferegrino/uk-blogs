Unlike what I thought before joining the Civil Service, being a Technology Delivery Manager has nothing to do with vans, bikes or packages! At its core, delivery management is really an enabling role. It\u2019s all about helping the team maximise the amount of quality work being produced."

            "text": "HOF is chiefly a software development team, so my day-to-day activities include running planning meetings, communicating with our varied stakeholders, removing blockers, and keeping our Kanban board looking as neat and tidy as possible. If I\u2019m doing my job well, everyone else in the team should find they have more time to focus on the things that matter in their jobs."

Although I wasn\u2019t accepted on the Fast Stream luckily my assessment centre scores were good enough to earn me a place on the Direct Appointment Scheme (a \u201cpeople with potential\u201d pool). From there, I got selected to join the Home Office as part of the DDS."

        {
            "text": "The DDS checked a lot of the boxes I was looking for, in particular the opportunity to rotate between different roles. As I wanted to career-switch from science into data and technology, being able to get an understanding of different jobs was essential to me. So, I jumped at the chance to join the DDS!"

On top of that, there\u2019s currently no one in the team doing that role, so you have to carve out your own niche. That was my situation six months ago before joining my current placement. I was excited for the challenge, but naturally very nervous too."

            "text": "From day one the supportive and friendly nature of my placement manager and my team allayed these fears. I can\u2019t thank the HOF team enough for their patience and understanding when I first joined. What they get right, in my opinion, is really valuing people, sharing responsibility as a team and always encouraging learning and development."

I\u2019ve interacted with a diverse range of colleagues in the Civil Service, all unified by their friendliness, helpfulness, and motivation to get the best possible job done. It\u2019s inspiring to be surrounded by people dedicated to making improvements for the public good."

            "text": "I\u2019ve just touched on the second thing that makes me proud: serving the public. For me, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the smaller details, but I love to regularly take a wider look and remember that everything I\u2019m doing is contributing to making peoples\u2019 lives better."
