During today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll update you on the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme, give you the latest information on the Countryside Stewardship applications window and review the Lump Sum Exit Scheme. Later in the programme, we\u2019ll introduce you to the RPA\u2019s Customer Development, Journey and Insight team, and hear about the launch of their RPA Research and Insight Network Group."

Alex, thanks for your time on The RPA Podcast."

            "text": "Alex: Yes, as part of the Agricultural Transition Plan, we - Defra and RPA - are launching three new schemes that will reward environmental land management; the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme, Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery. The Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme will reward farmers to produce public goods such as water quality, biodiversity, animal health and welfare and climate change mitigation, alongside food production. Food production is an important element that often gets missed. These public goods are essential to meeting our 25 Year Environment Plan, Net Zero and animal health and welfare ambitions, alongside our ambitions for a productive and competitive agriculture sector.\u202fWe launched the SFI pilot scheme last year and the SFI live service will open for applications later this year."

            "text": "James: And you\u2019ve played a pivotal role in the Sustainable Farming Incentive\u2019s pilot phase, so how have you approached this stage?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: Well, this has been a joint effort between the RPA and Defra, and the team\u2019s approach to the Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot has been focused on learning. We\u2019ve been learning how to engage differently with farming communities, working in partnership to help build the future. Also learning how we create a package of standards that suitably rewards farmers for the work they do and how to appropriately streamline the administration to make it simpler. We held three pilot Welcome Webinars for customers and stakeholders, and they\u2019ve been well attended with good engagement. We introduced a collaborative online community recently and it\u2019s great to see participants sharing insight with one another."

        {
            "text": "Alex: So, we achieved a significant milestone in February when we issued the first batch of quarterly payments to those Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot participants whose agreements started in November 2021. This has been the culmination of lots of hard work across teams in the Rural Payments Agency and Defra\u2019s Future Farming & Countryside Programme. Those payments reflected our review of the Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot standards payment rates and will continue to be made to farmers on a quarterly basis, and by the middle of the appropriate month."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And were you pleased with the initial uptake?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: The application window closed at the end of September 2021 and we were really pleased at the amount of interest shown and the willingness of those who\u2019ve applied to work with us to shape the new scheme. We had a good mix of farm types, sizes, locations and tenures, and we\u2019ve been working hard to get agreement offers out to applicants - the first of these were issued in October 2021 for a 1st November start. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to issue agreement offers on a regular basis with over 800 issued so far. But there are a few where it\u2019s taking more time to complete the processing. We\u2019re keen to maximise what we learn through the pilot, including any lessons on where we can resolve issues at application more quickly."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So what have been the key learnings so far?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: Well, we\u2019ve only just started the in-depth learning process but there have been some important findings that we\u2019ve already applied to the SFI live service that is due to launch later this year. For example, pilot farmers told us that they wanted to be able to apply when it made sense for them and their businesses. So, when the SFI live service is launched there\u2019ll be no application submission deadline and the RPA will process applications on a rolling basis. Farmers also told us they wanted the application process to be straightforward enough for them to complete it without having to pay someone to make sense of long documents and complicated forms. We\u2019ve worked to improve the application service and make wording in agreement documents clearer. We\u2019ve also asked pilot participants to keep a journal of their thoughts and reflections at each stage, and these will provide valuable insights into what has worked well, and highlight areas we need to improve as we develop the scheme in the years ahead."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Thanks Alex. We heard more about the SFI scheme in March, so can you update our listeners on the latest information and what they can expect for the launch this summer?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: Of course. First of all, the scheme will open for applications this June and applications will be made via the Rural Payments service, as was the case for the pilot scheme. It will be available to over 84,000 farmers in England who are eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme \u2013 this includes tenants and upland farmers. We\u2019ll support the roll-out with further information nearer the time, along with engagement with our customers and partners.\u200b It\u2019s really important to highlight that this year is just the beginning and will add more standards into the scheme in later years. So this isn\u2019t the final offer and you can visit the GOV.UK website to see a roadmap of when we\u2019ll add further standards and levels in the years ahead."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And just to be clear, what does \u2018eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme\u2019 mean?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: Eligible for BPS means your business, the Single Business Identifier \u2013 or SBI - that\u2019s applying for SFI, must have at least 5 hectares of BPS eligible land and 5 or more BPS entitlements on 16th May 2022. Your business - or SBI - doesn\u2019t have to claim BPS in 2022 or to have received BPS payments in the past."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So does the minimum 5 hectares of BPS eligible land set the minimum area that can enter into an SFI standards agreement?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: No it doesn\u2019t, the minimum 5 hectares of BPS eligible land doesn\u2019t set a minimum area that\u2019s eligible for SFI, as there isn\u2019t a minimum area you can enter into an SFI standards agreement."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So why are you linking SFI eligibility to BPS eligibility?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: In early rollout we are doing this purely for practical reasons \u2013 because farmers who are BPS eligible are already registered with the RPA. This requirement will be removed in later years so a wider range of farmers can apply for an SFI standards agreement."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: And how long do the Sustainable Farming Incentive agreements last?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: SFI standards agreements will last for 3 years, and farmers need to have management control of the land entered into the agreement for its 3-year duration. Payments will be on a quarterly basis, with the first payment made three months after the agreement starts. We\u2019ll use a new, more supportive approach for checking progress of your agreement. If you cannot deliver your agreement, we\u2019ll start by helping you fix what\u2019s gone wrong, wherever possible and, unlike previous schemes, there will be no additional financial penalties applied. We\u2019re making the scheme more flexible so farmers will be able to add new standards to their agreements annually. And we\u2019ve also extended eligibility for tenants, so if they occupy land on a \u2018rolling\u2019 year-by-year basis they\u2019ll be able to apply to the scheme."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: Great, and what would be your message to our listeners in the run-up to SFI applications opening?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Alex: Well, farming is changing, and the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme aims to help farmers manage land in a way that both improves food production and is more environmentally sustainable. As a new farming scheme, it\u2019s crucial that our standards have been co-designed with farmers and stakeholders. We have listened and improved the application process; it\u2019s straightforward and complements other available schemes. Soil health is of paramount importance and SFI rewards a new way of farming with environmental outcomes to benefit it all\u200b, so I would urge all your listeners to read the latest guidance on GOV.UK and get ready to apply."

        {
            "text": "James: Thanks Alex. It\u2019s certainly a pivotal period in the agricultural transition process and we\u2019ll look forward to hearing more in the months ahead."

We didn\u2019t make the progress we expected in getting agreement offers out in a timely way and there was no one thing, there were a number of factors which contributed to this. We know that\u2019s frustrating for our customers and are sorry for the delays that caused. As with all our services, we\u2019ve focused on learning from the experience of our customers and teams and improving this year. I would say that our customers can really help here too by getting documents and information needed to us as quickly as possible."

            "text": "Rozanne: It has indeed James. This year, we\u2019ve made it easier to make Mid-Tier applications by making it possible for farmers and landowners to apply online. We\u2019re encouraging customers to apply for Mid-Tier online wherever possible as we think applying online is much quicker than paper applications. It\u2019s also much safer because there\u2019s no risk of applications getting lost in the post and of course for us, and this is important too, it\u2019s a more sustainable option."

It\u2019s a new two-year capital grant that allows farmers and landowners to apply for the FY2 Woodland Infrastructure capital item. You can apply and start your agreement at any point during this year, and agreements run for two years after the agreement start date James, and if you complete the works before then, you can claim your funding before the 2 years are up."

We\u2019ll also be publishing an RPA blog soon which will address some frequently asked questions and provide more information about our learnings so far.

        {
            "text": "Rozanne: Yes, that\u2019s right James, there are. The SFI scheme will be open to farmers eligible for BPS, Basic Payment Scheme, who already have an agreement under an existing agri-environment scheme - such as Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship \u2013 provided the Sustainable Farming Incentive standard they choose is compatible with their existing agreement and doesn\u2019t result in them being paid twice for similar activities. And again, further information can be found on our GOV.UK website."

        },
        {
            "text": "Duncan: Well, we know there are often a range of considerations for farmers when they\u2019re looking to retire or leave the industry. One of the issues is the financial impact as a lack of capital can prevent them from leaving and we think the Lump Sum Exit Scheme could help them. The time is right to offer this now as farming and the way government supports it is really changing, so it\u2019s good to offer this alternative alongside the Agricultural Transition."
        },

        {
            "text": "Duncan: Yes, we ran a consultation on a Lump Sum Exit Scheme for farmers and our proposed approach to delinking payments which had 654 responses. It was great to see the engagement and the interest. After going through the responses, we decided a number of things including that farmers must have claimed Basic Payment Scheme in 2018 or earlier scheme years to be eligible \u2013 although there are some exceptions. Farmers will also have to surrender their English BPS entitlements before they can receive the lump sum payment. Once they\u2019ve received the lump sum payment, they won\u2019t be able to claim further Basic Payment Scheme or delinked payments in England, as part of that business."

It\u2019s important to highlight here that farmers will be able to keep their farmhouse, other buildings and non-agricultural land and there will be more flexible rules for partnerships and limited companies than we had proposed in the consultation."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So how will the payments be calculated?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Duncan: The lump sum will be based on the average BPS payments made to the farmer for the 2019 to 2021 scheme years - this is known as the farmer\u2019s \u2018reference amount\u2019. The reference amount will be capped at \u00a342,500 and multiplied by 2.35 to calculate the lump sum. That means the maximum lump sum a farmer can be paid is \u00a399,875, which is in line with proposals in the consultation where the upper limit of \u00a3100,000 was broadly supported."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: So for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme, the outcome of consultation focused heavily on the financial support?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Duncan: It was certainly a significant factor. The findings actually supported the view that financial security and assistance was a key factor and those looking to leave the industry needed support. So, following the consultation, we plan to offer farmers in England who wish to exit the industry the option of applying in 2022 for a lump sum payment."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: I saw that guidance was published earlier this year, so can you summarise the key points of the scheme for our listeners?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Duncan: Of course. Yes, we published guidance on lump sum payments in February and this included details of how these payments will be taxed. The RPA also sent information to Basic Payment Scheme applicants to explain how they can request a forecast statement showing the lump sum amount they could receive. Full scheme guidance was shared when we opened the scheme earlier in April. And we expect payments to begin to be made for some farmers from November this year, but farmers will have a longer period if they need it to arrange their exit. The scheme has been designed to enable those who wish to retire or leave the industry to do so in a planned way. By freeing up land, the scheme will also open up opportunities for new entrants and farmers wishing to expand their businesses."

            "text": "James: Great, thanks Duncan. And the Basic Payment Scheme application window opened on 15 March for farmers to claim their 2022 payments. The deadline for BPS applications \u2013 without penalty \u2013 is 16\u00a0May, so what\u2019s your advice to farmers who are eligible for BPS but considering the Lump Sum Exit Scheme?"
        },

            "text": "Duncan: Well, we\u2019re encouraging farmers who are considering applying for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme to apply for BPS in 2022 as well as applying for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme later on, that\u2019s provided their continuing farming circumstances allow them to do so. This will protect applicants if they find that they are not eligible for the lump sum scheme, cannot complete the transfer of their land in time, or decide to withdraw their application before payments are made."

These events will be at different times of the year, on different days, including in the evenings, and in different locations across England. We know our customers don\u2019t work office hours and sometimes there are much busier parts of the year than others, so we\u2019re really looking to be as flexible as we can when organising these events. We also hope to attend some of the agricultural shows and events \u2013 so you\u2019ll find us at the RPA stand, so please do come along and say hello and share your feedback with us!"

For us we are looking for real life examples; maybe perhaps invite you to be in a podcast or star in a video. If you\u2019ve had a good experience with one of our schemes or have great tips about how to prepare a claim, or perhaps are able to explain how a grant has changed or improved your business, why not help us by sharing your knowledge and advice with others in the community?"

            "text": "Jen: This is something we\u2019ve been so conscious of from the very beginning. We know how valuable time is and especially in the farming industry. So all we would ask is that our panel members try to participate in at least one piece of research a year or attend at least one meeting a year. These can be virtual, on the phone or in person. But the only commitment we\u2019re asking to sign up is one. They can absolutely do more if they want to, so they\u2019ll be invited to various bits of research and we\u2019ll also try to keep it as relevant as we can. So we won\u2019t be asking arable farmers about their opinions on our livestock services, so it\u2019ll be very much built around what they\u2019re eligible for, but what they participate in will be very much in their control. And people can always leave the Group if they want to, although of course we really hope that they don\u2019t; but in that event all they\u2019d need to do is drop us an email and ask to be taken off the mailing list."

            "text": "Jen: Absolutely, yes. It is so important we do that because that gives them that sense of what I\u2019m saying is actually being listened to and acted on. We know there is nothing more frustrating than offering suggestions or advice and then feeling ignored, so we will be sharing as much as we can, as soon as we can. We may put some of the findings on our GOV.UK page as well, our Twitter page, on Facebook or we may email, write or update people on the telephone. And that reminds me, if anyone doesn\u2019t follow RPA on social media, then maybe give us a follow today so that you don\u2019t miss out on any updates. There will be times when we can\u2019t always do everything we wish we could do with the feedback but even in those scenarios, we will still go back to people and say we\u2019ve listened, this is what we\u2019d like to be able to do, maybe it\u2019s not possible just yet but it\u2019s very much on our notepad for the future. And just, again, really reiterate to people that we are listening to what they tell us. We know that nobody knows farmers\u2019 needs better than the farmers themselves."

        {
            "text": "Jen: It has, yes. So we\u2019re looking to create more videos that actually feature farmers, showing their experience in real time so that we can fully understand their perspective and their challenges. And equally we\u2019re also doing a lot more videos to show people how to do things. So how to apply for schemes and how to use certain aspects of the systems. Recently what we did was get some customers to give us their views on the videos we have on our YouTube page. So these were how to tutorials really and, as a result of the feedback that we got, we\u2019re making improvements to the voiceover, we\u2019re clarifying the introductions, giving more information within the video and also looking at accessibility is greater detail. So the feedback that we\u2019ve already had is already having such a tremendous impact and we\u2019ll be sharing those new and improved videos with the customers who helped with this project first and thanking them for their suggestions. But yes, videos are definitely something we want to do more of and is something that will definitely feature on the panel."
