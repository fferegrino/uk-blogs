TerraFIRMA* is a new project spinning up at the Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) institutions across the UK. TerraFIRMA (\u2018Future Impacts Risks and Mitigation in a Changing Earth \u00a0System\u2019) will use Earth system modelling to investigate the impacts of future global change on air quality as well as water resources, wildfires, marine ecosystems and global sea level rise."

            "text": "TerraFIRMA will generate data on air pollutants under different scenarios of emissions and climate. These will include warming overshoot scenarios where global warming exceeds key targets (e.g.\u00a01.5 to 2\u00b0C) and cools thereafter,\u00a0stabilization scenarios where global warming is held at these targets and climate change mitigation options. We will also be developing a higher resolution model to test these scenarios over the UK region. We think there is huge potential for these data to be used by the air quality impacts community and our first job is to find out who you are!"

We are keen to understand what use cases you might have for TerraFIRMA data and how we can extend the model simulations to be useful for assessing air quality impacts, for example, through downscaling. Initially we would like to meet with interested parties in small groups or teams with the view to holding a workshop in Autumn 2022."
