This was a real test of a new manager, and also of an organisation\u2019s culture. The department passed the test with flying colours, allowing me this time and I felt very supported throughout."

I feel privileged to have been able to do this, the first three months were simply supporting, as we tried to figure out which way was up. The last month, however, was me on my own. It was daunting, but I really loved it."

I am still daunted, but really looking forward to having this time, especially if the weather holds out and we get time in the garden!"

I already do compressed hours, which has meant more time than I could have hoped for (or just occasionally more than I wanted!) with my kids. But for me, shared parental leave seemed like a no-brainer - I get time with my kids at an important point in their development."

This was important to me as I felt it would mean a good opportunity for someone, but also ensure that they had the right autonomy and authority to operate while I was off. Once this process had concluded, I spent a lot of time with the individual to make the handover as smooth as possible. I had some \u2018keep in touch\u2019 (KIT) days, but not many as I wanted to focus on my family while equally not making my cover feel they had to run things past me."

I am sure it is the same for many across departments. Once back, it was a process of prioritisation to get back up to speed and balance the current asks, but like an annual leave break, you find a way through, and you build up your knowledge as you go. For the individual who covered for me, it was also an excellent opportunity for them to further their career."
