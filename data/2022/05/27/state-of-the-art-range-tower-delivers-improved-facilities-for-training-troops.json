[Landmarc Support Services]The tower was specifically designed by contractors, Jubb, and architects, Bailey Partnership, to reflect the requirement for a modern and robust facility to operate in a remote and challenging environment. The tower at Castlemartin has three floors, with access to the building and ablutions on the lower floor, a large viewing area on the first floor and the control room on the second floor. The roof of the tower houses the communications aerials, photovoltaic (PV) system and serves as an additional viewing area."

The control area also has large windows suitable for viewing the firing lanes and targets that the TAOs and Range Control Officers (RCO) are responsible for."

Local\u00a0labour was also used to construct the tower and sustainable procurement measures were used to purchase the materials."

I'm pleased to say that this was achieved."
