I have regular sessions with participants throughout their time on the programme covering what commercial data HM Land Registry has and how it might help them, introducing them to stakeholders and helping them understand our statutory services. The support doesn\u2019t stop at the end of the programme as they remain members of Geovation. It\u2019s the best role I have had in HM Land Registry and it\u2019s very rewarding to see how the companies we have supported go from strength to strength."
