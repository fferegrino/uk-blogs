The digital transformation in the department was intriguing. The interview panel explained that the role had been filled, but they thought I\u2019d be great for their product manager vacancy. I was honest and said I\u2019d never heard of it. They gave me an overview and it seemed like something I could do."

We built systems to allow local businesses and people on low incomes to apply for financial support. This was a stern test of our technical skill, speed and team cohesion, and I\u2019m pleased to say it was a successful project. This gave me the confidence to apply for the role in the rapid response team at DLUHC. In my new role, I\u2019ve continued to work on high-profile, fast-paced projects, like Homes for Ukraine."

My colleagues are always generous in sharing their knowledge and feedback. This type of work is not easy. We\u2019re grappling with multi-faceted human problems and limited resources. Sharing ideas and mutual support with colleagues and peers helps."
