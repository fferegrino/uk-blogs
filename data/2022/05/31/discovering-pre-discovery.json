We are one of the top 5 government departments by amount of grant funding given out. We decided to do a pre-discovery because we knew this was a huge topic and a really important project for BEIS."

Within a few hours of opening ticket sales, all 50 places were filled! So we knew this was a topic lots of people are interested in."

            "text": "We mapped them on a Risk-Impact diagram \u2013 what would be the biggest risk if we didn\u2019t address it? And where do we think we could make a big difference? This made it easier to understand what our priorities should be."

            "text": "We knew that senior stakeholders are very busy and that we\u2019d need to talk to them again in discovery. So we decided to start by sending off a survey to get some high-level information about areas that desk research hadn't told us much about."

            "text": "When we move into discovery we will spend most of our time talking to people: our users and stakeholders have a wealth of information that will help us understand the problem. They are the reason why we are trying to make improvements in the first place."
