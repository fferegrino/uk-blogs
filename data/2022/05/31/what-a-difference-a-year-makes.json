As a Board member, it meant having formal oversight responsibilities for the first time - but for the organisation as a whole, it meant so much more. The ability to develop our own culture, the ability to \u2018think outside the box\u2019 when tackling knotty economic and trade issues, and our ability to give robust and scrupulously independent advice to government ministers were all heightened when we made that transition a year ago. It really started to \u2018feel different\u2019 as we developed our own ways of working, making us more effective and more confident.\u202f\u00a0"

Many colleagues have worked on sensitive and high-profile issues that have attracted interest and scrutiny from businesses, the media, and the political world. Others have built the foundations of a strong organisation, navigating the complexities of building a new government body from the ground up, amidst ceaseless political and global change. And we grew, as well, with many new colleagues joining the organisation and swiftly making their mark.\u00a0"

No longer were we simply reviewing and revising measures that had been put in place during our decades as part of the EU; instead, we were beginning to shape a more tailored and specific trade remedies regime for the UK. And this was just the first of many to come over the years ahead.\u202f\u00a0"
