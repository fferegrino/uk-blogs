            "text": "Who remembers the days when you could win a goldfish at the fairground? Or have you wondered what to do with the unwanted contents of a garden pond? \u00a0Studies have shown a higher likelihood of non-native and/or ornamental aquatic species being found in waters near fairground sites and garden centres as a result of the animals being released when no longer wanted. Ornamental fish species such as koi carp have been introduced into commercial fisheries often bringing with them the risk of koi herpes virus, a disease that affects common carp, causing losses and an economic impact to fisheries. Even releasing the wrong animal or plant into your garden pond could start an unwanted invasion if they can spread from there into the wider countryside, for example in the event of a flood which connects your pond to a nearby river. Elsewhere, invasive species such as lionfish are damaging coral reef fish communities across the Caribbean following the first report of them off Florida in the 1980s, and the species is now becoming established in the Mediterranean as well."

            "text": "Since the 1950s, when air freight became the norm, a trend for more diverse food in UK restaurants, shops and fishmongers has grown.\u00a0 Possibly the largest live aquatic animal trade is in American lobsters. In 2015, people participating in a religious festival released over 300 American lobsters into the sea off Sussex. Although the release was done through the belief that the compassionate act of releasing captive animals is positive, the reality was a potential introduction of disease, hybridisation and competition with native species, all of which could be damaging to our native lobsters."

            "text": "Another route that both ornamental species and animals for food can find their way into the wild is when they are purchased and used as live fishing bait, both through animals escaping the hook and being released if unused at the end of a trip.\u00a0 Fishing kit along, with small watercraft like paddle boards and dingys, also pose a hidden risk.\u00a0 In 2010 the invasive pink or killer shrimp was identified in a reservoir in Cambridgeshire.\u00a0 The most likely route of arrival in a UK lake was as a hitchhiker on wet kit or within puddles in niches on watercraft without the owners knowing or realising, that they were there, highlighting the need to clean and dry kit every time after use."

Our experts have knowledge of how to spot potential threats to local biodiversity and through this decision support tool (AS-ISK: Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit) we can help people understand the nature of the threat and what can be done to reduce it. And with the current trend for changing conditions here and abroad due to climate change, now is the time to reassess which non native species could become established in the coming years."
