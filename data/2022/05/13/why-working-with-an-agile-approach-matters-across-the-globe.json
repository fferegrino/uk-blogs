            "text": "Frameworks and standards can achieve change, like in UK, but these can't necessarily be applied the same way in different countries. Instead, by understanding, testing and adapting different approaches in small, regular iterations, other governments can shape and contextualise good practice ways of working and delivery methods over time gradually and methodically."

            "text": "In the countries we work in, the focus has been on developing the technical digital skills to push forward the delivery of services - a necessity often borne of political and economic pressures. It is just as important to build soft skills in leaders - and teams - to support agile ways of working, like leading with direction, not dictats. It takes a real shift in mindsets across all levels, valuing collaboration over hierarchy and traditional structures. Our work focuses on dedicated coaching for leaders and teams to ensure that agile practices and behaviours are embedded and really understood in the organisations we work with."

        {
            "text": "For leaders the shift in mindset is not only behavioural but also the need to focus on outcomes over outputs, evidencing tangible progress and working out what delivers the most value for the organisation and its users will help build the case for agile and build capacity through delivery. This also means that leaders need to adjust their focus, set expectations and help manage financial or political pressures so that teams can focus on what\u2019s important - meeting user needs."

Over the pandemic, we saw that in some areas, that the rush to provide digital services has led to the fast implementation of solutions that don\u2019t actually meet what users need, resulting in the loss of time and money as they have to be re-done, and damaging citizens\u2019 trust in government."

        {
            "text": "For organisations that are new to digital service delivery, it is crucial to introduce new skills and behaviours gradually to help mitigate risk. Part of this sometimes has to be done through managing demand for technical support from across government, so that the lead organisation can succeed in delivering value in a sustainable way, building in long-term sustainability and capability."

            "text": "Introducing change more slowly also helps teams developing digital tools and services to better understand citizen needs and incorporate them from the outset, and taking time to understand different regulatory approaches and attitudes to things like privacy that may impact how and what we help teams deliver."

Talking about what\u2019s being delivered, what it means for the organisation, and how it impacts the organisation, is essential to helping get the buy-in and support at an organisational level."

Part of the approach should focus on testing out what gives the teams we work with (as well as our own) the safety and structure to try new things, a critical factor in agile adoption when there may be organisational or political pressures."
