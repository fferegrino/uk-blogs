My focus recently has been on the deployment of Microsoft Teams and on moving us from existing communication services such as Jabber and WebEx onto this new platform."

Over the last 25 years, both in my personal and professional life, I\u2019ve known far too many people affected by mental health issues. Whether that be through serious depression, and the impact that has had on their daily life, or people who have taken their own lives due to mental illness and despair."

My family and I have lost a significant number of friends in our community, even as recently as this month. Charming, loving, caring sons,\u00a0daughters, brothers and sisters who have\u00a0succumbed\u00a0to their mental health battles."

For those suffering, it seems there\u2019s no hope or light on the horizon, making it harder for families to pull together and move forward."

I was able to seek the help I needed through charities, plus my incredible close friends and family, and positively move on with my life."

Talking openly and supporting charities that do the groundwork; avoiding mental health \"taboo\" subjects, such as depression, self-harm, suicide and encouraging people that it's OK to get the help they need, such as counselling, therapy or even just picking up the phone to a professional/charity organisation such as the Samaritans, MIND and SOS Silence of Suicide."

Entire communities can be affected by these challenges, but collectively we can all help to break away from the ongoing sadness."

Living through a pandemic, for some, would have magnified mental health issues. As a single parent working from home (as someone \u2018kindly\u2019 pointed out at the school gate for me right at the start of it all), I\u2019ve felt the strain of a single adult situation through the long days and nights, week on week pushing through to the next \u2018Tier\u2019 (remember those!?)."

In the past I\u2019ve completed \u2018fun-runs\u2019 for various charities, and last year I volunteered for the Matthew Tree Project, packing fruit and veg boxes to send out to families who are borderline homeless.

Both are super worthy causes if you can spare the time, all run by fantastic volunteers."

I\u2019m currently in \u2018training\u2019 (yes, real training, apparently!), including mini-mountain walks (I\u2019m sure Pen-Y-Fan counts..?). I\u2019m hoping to raise some money for the mental health charity MIND, to help tackle some of these issues and support those that are not so lucky, or who are so far into the black void they can\u2019t see a way out. Please support me if you can, any little helps."
