            "text": "You may not be aware that the Animal and Plant Health Agency co-ordinates the government response to any disease outbreak affecting animals in the UK by mobilising an incident management team called the National Emergency Epidemiology Group (NEEG). The actions of this group are vitally important to ensure livestock, wildlife and more recently pets are protected from any escalating disease situations. This is necessary to manage the disease by limiting its spread through biosecurity actions and minimising the impacts on associated industries and the economy."

But what is the role of this group and why is it so important? In this blog, we hear from Dr Vicky Kalogeropoulou, senior scientific project manager and member of the NEEG as she explains more."

            "text": "The NEEG is an APHA emergency group which is rapidly formed in response to disease incidents which have the potential for high impact on animal or public health, and rapid spread. These notifiable animal diseases must be reported to APHA. Typically, the NEEG is mobilised once a notifiable disease has been identified by our diagnostic team and confirmed at a disease confirmation teleconference led by the UK\u2019s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) or the CVO for Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (depending on the where the outbreak is). One of the strengths of the NEEG is that it can also be mobilised before disease is confirmed, if there is a strong suspicion of a notifiable disease. This significantly increases the speed of the disease investigation, especially the gathering of potential source and spread tracings, which are key to disease control."

You will have seen similar modelling on television as part of the Covid-19 press conferences that the Prime Minister and Chris Witty frequently gave. Disease surveillance and tracing plans are prepared to investigate the possible source and spread of the disease which feed into the development of control strategies to prevent further spread."

Inter-relationships between the science and policy groups during a disease outbreak are key to a successful response, and therefore many groups and committees meet and work collaboratively together to control and eradicate the disease during the outbreak. For this reason, a series of daily and weekly meetings are always established at the start of an outbreak to coordinate all activities, participants and events."

Exercise assessment and the lessons learned from them is then used to highlight and promote best practice and to review and update contingency plans."

The exercise tested our response to a hypothetical outbreak of foot and mouth disease on 74 different premises.
