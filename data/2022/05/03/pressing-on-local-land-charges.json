Fast forward to today and we are really starting to realise that vision."

As such, we spend every working day pushing ourselves to transfer all LLC records in England and Wales by 2025 to the national register.\u00a0 An ambition we announced a year ago."

            "text": "As a result of our work so far, residents in 40 local authorities are benefiting from this modern, digital service. The pace at which we are now migrating the local authorities has dramatically increased with 28 of the 40 completed since April 2021 and 16 of the 28 in the last six months. We attribute this progress to lessons learnt from the first 12 migrations and a commitment to continuously improve our approach."

We have automated the data discovery process by combining our Data Analysis Dashboard with local authorities\u2019 software. This has reduced the analysis processing time from 3 months to 4 days on average."

            "text": "During the early days of the programme, we travelled to council sites to manually create the spatial extents. With an average 50,000 charges per local authority and each taking 3-10 minutes, this was unsustainable. The introduction of the Migration Helper has radically sped up data cleansing by allowing multiple people to access the information remotely through GOV.UK."

The digital data is then loaded into the Migration Helper, pre-populating the data-capture screens. These enhancements have increased our per day productivity five-fold, as well as improving data quality."
