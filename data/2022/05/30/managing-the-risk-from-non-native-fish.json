Non-native fish come in all shapes and sizes, from the small, unassuming topmouth gudgeon and fathead minnow, to giant wels catfish. They all carry a different degree of risk to our native fish stocks and wildlife."

            "text": "We have a long history of non-native fish in England. Rainbow trout, wels catfish and zander first arrived in the 19th century. Grass carp, topmouth gudgeon and Prussian carp are more recent introductions. While some are restricted to just a few sites, others have colonised many parts of the UK by escaping from fish farms and ornamental ponds, being introduced legally for angling, or stocked illegally or unintentionally."

        {
            "text": "Popular recreational fisheries have been developed for some non-native fish. For instance, the River Severn and Fenland drains are famed for zander and many stillwaters attract anglers targeting specimen wels catfish."

        {
            "text": "However, introducing non-native species will always pose some risk. Wels and zander are predators. The feeding habits of others, like grass carp, can upset the ecology of a water, making it less favourable for native wildlife. All non-native species can act as vectors for new exotic fish parasites and diseases."

        {
            "text": "The level of risk depends on the species and the type of water it is being introduced to. At the Environment Agency, we regulate which fish can be stocked and kept in which waters. While we take a precautionary approach to non-native fish, we do permit a handful of species to be stocked to support angling, but only in certain circumstances."

            "text": "It is vital that the right fish are stocked in the right place. For instance, we do not take any chances with rainbow trout. Despite having only bred successfully in just a few waters throughout their 150-year history, we will only permit their stocking with infertile \u201ctriploid\u201d fish."

However, my team at our National Fisheries Laboratory has been leading the way on identifying Prussian carp through detailed morphological and molecular (DNA) analysis.

More information is available on the Angling Trust website."

The species are extremely invasive, they outcompete our native fish for food and habitat, and in some waters, they can account for over 90% of the fish biomass, ruining the quality of the angling and wider ecology."
