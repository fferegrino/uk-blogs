The Network has been providing Departmental language-based support to projects in government, from creating a survey in Ukrainian for the ONS, delivering basic Cantonese to assist FCDO in their work with British Nationals from Hong Kong and helping HMRC with some of their investigations in Farsi too! (If you\u2019re in the Civil Service, please contact the Network if you would like to join or if you need Departmental language-based support.)"

Having started 2022 with 213 members, the Civil Service BSL Network has rapidly increased to over 400! Members meet up regularly to practise and learn BSL supported by Deaf BSL-using colleagues. The Network helps support those on their BSL learning journey with conversation practice, hosts taster sessions (introductory classes) and also circulates a newsletter."

Having a statutory commitment to improving communication for Deaf people feels very empowering."
