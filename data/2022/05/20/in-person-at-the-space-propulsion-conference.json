This site builds capacity in chemical propulsion testing up to 1500N and gives industry the opportunity to build, test, and get to market quicker, all within the UK. Supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council and operated by NAMMO UK, both of whom were present, we made a great impression on announcing the site and we have already received enquiries for use."

Andrew Ratcliffe, Chief Engineer at the UK Space Agency, joined a panel with the heads of our fellow ESA member states:\u00a0Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, Italy and ESA\u2019s director of Space Transportation. What really resonated with attendees was the UK\u2019s clear direction and ambition for space, and all the opportunities we plan to explore as outlined in the National Space Strategy."

            "text": "As well as sharing our own work, we wanted to gain a deeper knowledge of propulsion and launch plans from around the world. The UK is aiming to be the leading country in Europe to offer small satellite launch, with the first horizontal launch from Spaceport Cornwall later this year, followed by vertical launches from Scotland at both Space Hub Sutherland and SaxaVord Spaceport in Shetland. The conference hosted several panel discussions and roundtables that were engaging, varied and ambitious on a range of subjects from air breathing electric propulsion to reusable systems. The session that stood out for me was the roundtable on engine developments for European small launchers, which explored other European ambitions to launch alongside the UK. We all came away having learned something new."
