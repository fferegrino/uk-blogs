The proposals aim to promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials, improve the diversity of participants, streamline clinical trial approvals, enable innovation, and enhance clinical trials transparency. \u00a0The engagement has been fantastic with over 2000 responses received.\u00a0 We, along with colleagues at the Health Research Agency, are now carefully considering the feedback."
