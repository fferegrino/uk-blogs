            "text": "Targeted screening aims to identify people with a higher risk of a condition beyond demographics such as age or gender. For example, smokers could be offered targeted lung cancer screening because they are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer regardless of age and gender."

            "text": "Stratified screening offers testing tailored to individual risk. For example, people with a family history of breast cancer could be referred to a high-risk clinic and screened more often than people without such a family history."
