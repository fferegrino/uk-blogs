These plans enable the recording of a person\u2019s thoughts and wishes and help to open up conversations that may have been avoided for a long time. This gives a person with a learning disability more choice and control over the end of their life."

People with learning disabilities have an equal right to a \u2018good death\u2019, and we hope by making conversations and planning more normalised through the Dying to Talk Project we can help everyone within MacIntyre and the wider health and social care sector to get end of life care right."
