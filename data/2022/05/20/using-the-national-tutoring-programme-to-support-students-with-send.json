They\u2019re really committed as they can see the results quickly and are conscious they have exams in the future. I\u2019d recommend to any school considering tuition for the first time to concentrate on year groups with upcoming exams, as this tuition can aid exam preparation and bring students on board."

            "text": "Any new programme requires some administration to implement. With the NTP, the task is to get students logged on and learning. With SEND students, some will need extra help. That might mean talking with them beforehand to ensure they\u2019re confident in attending the session, making sure they are comfortable talking with their tutor, and briefing their tutor so that they are clear on the adjustments that may be needed for individual students and which areas they need to focus on."

            "text": "Some of our students are happier talking to their tutors than others, but one positive we\u2019ve seen from our tuition partner (TP), MyTutor, has been that they can generally offer the same tutor week after week. For students with SEND this is helpful, as they can sometimes struggle to work effectively and it can take time to build relations and trust. I would recommend you speak with your TP and see whether tutor consistency is something they can offer."

We knew that tuition would be beneficial for them, so we discussed what we could do to help them feel\u00a0more comfortable. It turned out that having a member of staff there would help, so someone sat in on the next session, and we\u2019ve had teaching assistants sit in on other sessions. This allows the students to concentrate on their learning and make the most of the sessions."
