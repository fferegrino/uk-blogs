Maybe you\u2019ve worked for a year or 2 in a different role but have been applying user-centred thinking to that role or a side project. For example, many content designers develop their UCD skills in entry roles to do with whilst writing for the web, before making the move into content design. It\u2019s all about leveraging the experience you\u2019ve got."
