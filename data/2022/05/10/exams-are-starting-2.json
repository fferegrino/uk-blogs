More than a million students will sit exams in thousands of different exam centres. More than 70,000 examiners and moderators will mark students\u2019 work or moderate teachers\u2019 marking, so that 5.7 million results can be issued in August. That\u2019s on top of the many thousands of exams and formal assessments already underway and still to be taken for vocational and technical qualifications.\u00a0"

An unprecedented package of support is in place for students this year, including the spacing out of exams so there are at least 10 days between the first and last exam in a subject, a choice of content in some subjects, the provision of formulae sheets in some exams, and advance information in most subjects to help students focus their revision. At the heart of all this are the students. But there are also parents, teachers, exams officers, invigilators, examiners and moderators all playing a part. \u00a0"

Depending on when the mistake was noticed, students might have sat part of an exam they weren\u2019t prepared for and missed the opportunity to take the scheduled paper. And they are likely to be interviewed and asked to sign confidentiality statements. If this happens and students are involved, don\u2019t let students out of the exam hall and make sure they are supervised while you get in touch with the exam board for advice."
