Generally, these schools were previously underperforming under local authority control and have been taken out of local authority control and made into academies to bring about improvement. Since 2016, the Secretary of State has been required by law to convert schools in receipt of an Inadequate judgement into sponsored academies. By taking the lowest rated schools off local authorities it inevitably means the quality of their remaining schools appears higher and the average for academies becomes lower."
