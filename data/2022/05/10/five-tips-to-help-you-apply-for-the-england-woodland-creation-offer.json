This then enables us to administer the payments which currently average \u00a311,800 per hectare and have the potential to be as high as \u00a319,500 per hectare in some locations."

This must be completed before we are able to run eligibility checks on your application. It\u2019s worth checking your details on the Rural Payments service to make sure they\u2019re up-to-date and any outstanding notifications have been resolved before making a EWCO application."

If there is a notification, we will ask that this is amended by contacting the Rural Payments service at ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk or by phone on 03000 200 301. This could be as simple as a change of address and is often easily rectified. However, we are only able to proceed with processing your application once this notification is resolved, or if we have been provided with evidence the RPA is currently processing any change."

This means SBIs and CRNs are a mandatory requirement for the lead applicant on the EWCO Application Form (both Parts A and Part B)."

The more notice you can give your nursery, the more likely they are to be able to fulfil any order you make later."
