The tranquil natural settings and well sheltered anchorage spots make the bay particularly popular for recreational activities such as boating."

            "text": "In 2020, an assessment was conducted by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) to evaluate the potential impacts of marine non-licensable activities on the designated features of Studland Bay Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ). Marine non-licensable activities are generally recreational activities including sailing, powerboating and diving. The assessment found that management measures were needed to protect the site\u2019s seagrass beds and seahorses from damage by anchoring."

            "text": "After much consultation with the boating community and users of the bay, a voluntary no anchor zone was introduced on 17 December 2021 in Studland Bay to help reduce damage caused by boats dropping and weighing anchors. The zone will also become a permanent larger area in June 2022."

Most people that we spoke with on the water were responsive and keen to receive the leaflet which explains the reasoning behind the voluntary no anchor zone and provides the co-ordinates which can be added to electronic charts to clearly define the boundaries."

            "text": "The seagrass beds provide several vital ecological functions. Most notably, seagrass beds stabilise sediments, provide habitat for species such as commercially important fish and seahorses, and act as a sink for atmospheric carbon. It is also home to bass and endangered undulate rays. Long-snouted seahorses are a designated feature of the MCZ and a protected species."
