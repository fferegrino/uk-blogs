The digital landscape is dominated by a small group of tech giants, and that can lead to negative consequences for all of us, for example:"

A new pro-competition approach is needed to oversee the most powerful digital firms and, in December 2020, our Digital Markets Taskforce proposed a blueprint for this regime."

This will help ensure digital markets are competitive and innovative."

We support the final proposals and will work with the government on the draft measures and with Parliament and stakeholders."

We\u2019re working closer than ever before with other regulators via the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, the DRCF, which published its workplan last week. We will also keenly follow the progress of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU. Collaboration with other jurisdictions is vital and we will work to ensure actions firms take to comply with their obligations result in good outcomes for UK consumers and businesses. Our success in securing a global commitment from Google relating to its Privacy Sandbox is a prime example of this."

A new pro-competition regime is needed to preserve and enhance a dynamic and innovative tech sector in the UK. While legislation develops, we will continue to protect consumers and businesses with our existing CMA powers and will build capacity, capability and knowledge in the DMU to make sure we are well-placed to use the new powers when they arrive."
