We are really keen to talk to and visit library services who are at an early stage in considering changes (or are in the process of making changes) to their library service provision. This helps us understand what\u2019s happening but also provides opportunities for councils to ask us questions. Sometimes we meet councils because they have contacted us; but other times we pick up the phone to talk to them because we\u2019ve heard they\u2019re planning changes, that a consultation is underway or being planned, or that a new strategy has been published."
