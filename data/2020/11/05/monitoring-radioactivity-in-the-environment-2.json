We are also exposed to man-made radioactivity, such as in medical applications used in hospitals and nuclear power. It is a legal requirement to make sure the amount of man-made radiation that people are exposed to from discharges is kept within a safe limit."

We use this information to estimate the amount of radiation the general public is exposed to, and particularly to those small groups of people who are most exposed because of their age, diet, location or way of life."
