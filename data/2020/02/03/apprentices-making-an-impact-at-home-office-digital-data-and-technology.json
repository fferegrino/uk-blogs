We have been trialling several apprenticeships, thanks to an active digital trailblazer community which has embraced the opportunities that employer-developed standards offer and a collaborative Government profession which sees departments working together to participate and take advantage."

            "text": "Home Office DDaT were key players in the first government cohort of a software developer accelerated apprenticeship which started in Autumn 2018, providing opportunities for eight individuals from across the department. Some of these committed individuals are now completing their Level 4 qualification now, just over a year on and far swifter than the usual two for this apprenticeship. You can read about the first to pass, Will Wayman. This programme makes a significant impact in increasing our civil servant capability, while reducing our use of contractors as we develop some of the most challenging and transformative technology projects the department has ever seen. So much so that we took on another nine apprentices last November, extending the opportunity to employees in other departments too."

To increase inclusivity and support the Home Office\u2019s social mobility aims, we focussed on aptitude and attitude, rather than requiring qualifications. This aims to bring our total new apprentice starts across DDaT this financial year up to 50. With our 2018-19 new intake less than 20, this really will make some impact.
