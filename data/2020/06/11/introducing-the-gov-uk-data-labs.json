Last year, Head of GOV.UK Jen Allum set out the GOV.UK vision on how we will meet these expectations and she recently posted on the future of GOV.UK. At the heart of this vision is transforming the way we use data on GOV.UK."

Working with data can be complex but the benefits are substantial. In order to do this properly, we have brought our data science and user-centred design disciplines together into the GOV.UK Data Labs."

On average we have seen 1,000 comments per day on everything from food deliveries to furlough schemes to the easing of lockdown. These comments, together with our analytics, can provide a valuable indicator of potential user needs for product teams, and evidence for possible policy changes."

An example was opening the knowledge graph up to content designers to use it as a way to ask questions of our content and users, such as \u201cgive me all the content that mentions [date], [department] or [thing]\u201d. This has been invaluable during COVID-19 as our content colleagues can self-serve answers to tricky questions like, \u201cgive me all the COVID-19 content published by the Cabinet Office after 1st March\u201d, for example."

Attributes like things (such as passports), people (like ministers), places (such as Ireland) and eligibility criteria (like costs and age) need to be identified and added to our content for the graph to be really valuable for government."

            "text": "We\u2019re looking at adding attributes to around 450,000 bits of content on GOV.UK, but this is not something we can do manually. Instead, we are using an AI process called Natural Language Processing, specifically entity extraction and information extraction. Through these processes, GOV.UK content is reviewed and any mentions of things like people, places, objects and costs, or services like 'renewing your passport', are automatically tagged with relevant descriptors. Our goal is to develop a corpus of government terms and to develop a semantic graph that can be added to govGraph, and can be used more widely across GOV.UK and government."
