We use intellectual property (IP) to remove the fakes and the fakers - which is cheap, quick and efficient. Gone are the long, drawn out legal conversations around links being removed. It can take less than four minutes to remove an infringing product from, as an example, Amazon using registered intellectual property [copyright, trademarks, design rights or patents] to prove the originality of the copied product."

From the early beginnings of the kitchen table, we now work with brands around the world."

SnapDragon\u2019s approach, and innovative software, means any business, large or small, anywhere in the world, can take control of their brand online \u2013 identifying infringements, and infringers, and taking them off line, preventing the visibility, purchase, export, import, distribution and sale of fake goods. Our solution is effective and affordable, making it truly unique in brand protection terms \u2013 and with the growth we have seen in the last four years, it seemed a good time to apply for the award."

We work passionately and diligently for our clients and to have been recognised for this through the Award, has been a really wonderful. We had a lovely lockdown party on Zoom \u2013 with fizz delivered to every team member in advance with balloons \u2026 to enable a real celebration."

Fake products contribute over 3.3% to world trade each year (Source: OECD, 2019) and it\u2019s a problem which isn\u2019t going away. Child labour, unsafe materials and poor-quality goods are commonplace with counterfeits, and it\u2019s every brand\u2019s responsibility to prevent these products, which pretend to be genuine, from getting into the hands of customers."
