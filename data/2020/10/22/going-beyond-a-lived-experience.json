Prison leavers need to think about where they are going to live following their release, what they need in order to move forward with their new life (such as valid ID, which can be a barrier to accommodation and employment) and also how they are going to resettle into the community.\u00a0"

            "text": "It is always difficult and nerve-wracking to apply for a job - you are putting yourself out there to be judged and assessed. Having an unspent conviction on your criminal record means that applying for roles can bring with it fears and doubts about how you will be treated by potential employers, or whether your background will act as a barrier to hiring you. Many employers, including the Civil Service, have signed up to initiatives such as Ban the Box, which aim to reduce the stigma faced by ex-offenders during the recruitment process."

            "text": "We know that people with convictions can be unemployed following their sentence for a number of reasons, whether that\u2019s because of barriers they face when applying for roles or their own personal barriers, such as confidence. Prison leavers have much lower levels of employment than the general population. Approximately 17% of prison leavers in 2011/12 were in employment one year after release, and much of this work is part-time or at very low wages (Gov.uk).\u00a0 Yet the opportunity of meaningful employment could be the turning point that someone needs in order to make a change to their lives, for the better."
