Long distance remote working is very difficult to do.\u00a0But in these uncertain times it is absolutely essential that we make time to know our colleagues well. One of the positives from this situation is the honesty and trust that has developed from some really difficult conversations.\u00a0The team know that I am on their side, I have their back and trust them to do their job."

However, there were days last week when I moved from staff recruitment, to helping with geography homework, from school budgets to science homework, equations to school risk assessments, recovery planning and it goes on\u2026\u00a0 We all have our own challenges and as a leader we must be flexible and adaptable enough to respond to the needs of our staff. Constant communication, respect for others and trust are the key ingredients to making this work."

All remote learning is set on Go4Schools so that students and their parents are all seeing the same resources and the same instructions \u2013 this keeps the message consistent and clear.\u00a0 Meetings take place via Teams so that face to face communication isn\u2019t lost.\u00a0We have even planned a virtual staff Friday night social so that people don\u2019t feel isolated! Sometimes you just need a glass of something and a good natter, even if it is through a computer screen."

These 3 elements will support all our colleagues, but for those who don\u2019t want to work a traditional 5-day week it has demonstrated that there is another way. I think we have shown that some meetings can be just as purposeful and effective via Teams or Zoom, that work can be completed at various times and still be high quality, that collaboration is better than working in isolation, whatever the means of sharing.\u00a0However, the continuous lack of face to face human contact I sincerely hope is a temporary measure \u2013 at times, there is no substitute for an individual conversation when you\u2019re both in the same room and not separated by a screen."
