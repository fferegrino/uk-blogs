            "text": "You may be wondering what event fees are. Essentially, they are fees for services (like the maintenance of\u00a0communal areas or\u00a0the provision of\u00a0care services, or even social gatherings for residents like\u00a0garden parties), which are collected after the homeowner leaves the property."

            "text": "In 2013, the Office of Fair Trading's investigation into retirement home transfer fee terms\u00a0found that some leases that included these fees were unfair. For example, some older people and their families weren\u2019t told about the fees. In the worst cases, people were unexpectedly charged for moving in a partner or carer to assist with their care. This wasn\u2019t happening in every case, but it was worrying for my team."

            "text": "One of the report\u2019s recommendations was for a national database of retirement leasehold properties to improve the transparency and presentation of event fee information ahead of purchase. This sounded great to me and I asked MHCLG\u2019s Digital team to approve the database."

            "text": "I was surprised to discover they wanted a lot more information than I had. What would be in the database? Who would administer it? How did we know it would meet the needs of our users and solve the problem we\u2019d identified? The team suggested doing a discovery\u00a0exercise\u00a0to really understand the issue.\u00a0MHCLG ran an open procurement and\u00a0Agilesphere\u00a0were appointed to deliver the discovery."

            "text": "For a policy officer with my background, this was a new way of working which was culturally different to anything I\u2019d done before. I had to get my head round new approaches such as\u00a0stand-ups,\u00a0show and tells, retrospectives,\u00a0scrums\u00a0and\u00a0sprints. But what I did like about it was the openness and transparency of the methodology\u00a0\u2013 even though\u00a0we are very familiar with engaging with stakeholders and consulting on policy proposals. This enabled\u00a0us\u00a0to get external stakeholders on board and help shape the research and solutions. Publishing this report is part of our commitment to those stakeholders that we would publicly share\u00a0the\u00a0findings."

Event fees are only a small part of that picture, which means that\u00a0a database that only held\u00a0information on\u00a0event fees\u00a0may only partially meet the needs of consumers."

Our work and\u00a0these\u00a0recommendations have implications for wider leasehold reform and the sales and marketing of these properties, but it all fits in with the current leasehold reform agenda and the future direction of\u00a0travel\u00a0for\u00a0improving the\u00a0home buying and selling\u00a0process."
