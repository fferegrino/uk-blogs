            "text": "LDL cholesterol is often referred to as \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d, as it can lead to fatty deposits building up in the arteries, causing them to harden and narrow \u2013 known as atherosclerosis. This then leads to an increased risk of developing CVD, including conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Statins may also exert some benefit by their anti-inflammatory effect in areas of cholesterol build-up within the walls of arteries. High cholesterol is said to account for 7.1% of deaths in England."

            "text": "One of the reasons for differences in press coverage is the frequent failure to distinguish what we mean when we talk about \u201cprevention\u201d of CVD. When a person has already had a cardiovascular event, such as a stroke or heart attack, it is obvious that one would want to reduce the likelihood of any future event. Approaches to prevention for these individuals is often referred to as \u2018secondary\u2019 prevention; preventing a future event after a first one has occurred. There is no debate about the benefit of statins for such people, and clinicians would always advise their use wherever possible in these circumstances."
        },
        {
            "text": "The situation is often seen as different for people who have not yet been identified as having cardiovascular disease, but who may be at increased risk of having a future cardiovascular event because they may have risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, a family history of CVD, a raised cholesterol etc.). Attempts to reduce the future risk of a CV event in these individuals, who have not yet shown signs of having CVD, is often termed \u2018primary\u2019 prevention, and it is in this area where most controversy exists."

        {
            "text": "Some argue the case for statins for almost all who have an increased CV risk, whereas others argue that this represents \u2018medicalising\u2019 the population and results in over prescribing. Scoring systems have been used to assess an individual\u2019s future CV risk, the most commonly used taking a ten year time scale, but others using a lifetime horizon."

This type of coverage can lead to doubt about the benefits of statins among both health professionals and the public. Consequently, it has led to some patients stopping their statin treatment because of concerns about the perceived side effects."

Serious adverse effects are extremely rare and the vast majority of people can tolerate them well and do not experience any problems. This has been confirmed by extensive research and a major review of evidence which has confirmed that the benefits of statins for those who might benefit from them far outweigh any possible adverse effects."

However, there are some people (over 150,000 in England) who have a raised cholesterol due to a single gene variation, a condition known as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). The genetic abnormality is inherited from a parent, causing high LDL cholesterol levels from birth, and behaviour change alone is insufficient to lower cholesterol adequately. FH patients will always need the addition of statin treatment, for LDL levels and CVD risk to be significantly lowered."

Overall low statin use could be because they are not being prescribed to eligible individuals, because patients refuse treatment, or because they stop taking the medication. As a result, it means that statin use is suboptimal, leaving significant numbers of people at risk of a preventable CVD event. \u00a0To address this, PHE, NHS England and a coalition of system partners \u2013 known as the National CVD Prevention System Leadership Forum (CVDPSLF) \u2013 is calling for statin use to be optimised."

In the case of statins, healthcare professionals can be confident that current recommendations on their use are based on robust and extensive evidence. No one doubts the benefit of statins when prescribed for those who are known to have CVD, so individuals in this category should be reassured of their benefits and encouraged to take their medication if at all possible."

Getting more individuals with a >10-20% ten-year risk of developing CVD on to statin therapy will save thousands of lives and help reduce the number of people suffering the burden of living with CVD."
