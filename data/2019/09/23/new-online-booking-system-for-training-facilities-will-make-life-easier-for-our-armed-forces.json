It is a new online booking service for our Armed Forces, which replaces paper forms and processes for troops looking to book facilities on the UK\u2019s training areas and ranges. As the BAMS and National Service Centre Manager for Landmarc Support Services (Landmarc), I am responsible for a team that supports all users of BAMS by providing training and technical help."

            "text": "With over 6,000 bookable facilities, one of the most important benefits of BAMS is that the military now has one system that provides complete visibility of everything that the training estate has to offer; which means more options to help meet vital training objectives. The military tend to focus on the main training areas when booking facilities as it is what they have always known. With BAMS you can now see all the different locations and facilities that are available across the country from ranges, dry training areas and urban complexes which should reduce clashes with availability and encourage use of other lesser known areas."
