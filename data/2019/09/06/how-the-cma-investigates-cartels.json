Those involved in cartels will often go to great lengths to ensure they go undetected. Therefore, we have a number of tools at our disposal to expose them, such as gathering covert intelligence or turning up at company offices to search them unannounced."

            "text": "It\u2019s worth noting that in the case of a tip-off from a whistle-blower who wishes to remain anonymous, those investigating the case will not meet the person or know who they are. Instead, the person will interact with specially trained officers from the CMA\u2019s intelligence team who are independent of the case team and will ensure that the identity of the whistle-blower is kept confidential. We will not be able to rely on what the whistle-blower has told us in any enforcement action. Whatever they tell us will help us to know where to look for evidence, but the case team will have to find this for themselves as part of their investigation."

The identity of the applicant will be known to the case team and, as a condition of their leniency, the applicant can be asked to provide evidence, including by acting as a witness."

One way our teams overcome this challenge is through the use of sophisticated review software and techniques. Digital evidence review software can help us trawl through thousands of documents, identifying crucial bits of evidence, key people and any gaps in the evidence. Other investigative steps will arise from the evidence review, which may include conducting further interviews, gathering more evidence and possibly additional site visits."

This is a document which outlines the CMA\u2019s initial findings in the cartel investigation and gives the parties an opportunity to reply. After this, the case may proceed to a final published CMA decision."
