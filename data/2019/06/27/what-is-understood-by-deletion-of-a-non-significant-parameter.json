            "text": "The Variation Classification guidelines list approximately 350 different types of variation change codes and classification sub-categories. These variations fall under three possible procedure types: TIA, TIB or TII and cover the active substance and finished product, devices and safety, efficacy, and pharmacovigilance changes. Further details of the procedure types can be found on our website."

Deletion of a \u2018non-significant\u2019 parameter is an example of one of these change codes and the following article will define and explain what a deletion of a \u2018non-significant\u2019 and \u2018significant\u2019 parameter is."

However, it is possible, if the deletion does not meet the relevant Type IA requirements and can be demonstrated by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) not to significantly impact the overall quality of the product, to submit the change as a TIB, z) (other variation) sub-category. This reasoning should be clearly explained and submitted as a justification and included in the variation submission."

        {
            "text": "As mentioned, there has been some confusion about what is classed as a non-significant parameter, with some deletions being submitted as a Type IA procedure and being refused. An example of this is where the deletion of finished product specification (FPS) parameters are submitted simply because they are controlled in-process during manufacture. This is not classed as a non-significant parameter."

For example, a change to related substance limits which would fall under changes outside the approved specification limits."

            "text": "The deletion of a 'non-significant' specification parameter as a Type IA notification should be limited to situations like the removal of outdated (obsolete) tests and not a critical parameter. An example of obsolete tests includes drug substance organoleptic properties e.g. odour, where the test is no longer required in accordance with current requirements and does not serve any particular purpose."

            "text": "It should not be an opportunity to try and delete any possible parameter or limit. Attention should always be given to the background of why the test was included in the first place and consequently the implication of the deletion, which in most cases will require assessment."
