I supervise offenders with unpaid work such as gardening, painting, and education training and employment courses. I find it rewarding as I am able to work with a diverse range of individuals, and after unpaid work, they approach me to say thank you, which is extremely rewarding. I received positive feedback from non-profits, charitable organisations and others who benefit from Community Payback work, that was also a rewarding experience.\u00a0"
