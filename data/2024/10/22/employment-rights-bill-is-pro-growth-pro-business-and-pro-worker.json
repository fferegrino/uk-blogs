It continues to attract significant media attention, as shown by today\u2019s front pages, which all lead on the bill\u2019s impact assessment published yesterday and words from the Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner telling Parliament how the bill will benefit ten million working people across the country."

She said: \u201cMy fight to support others out of insecurity into stability and restore respect is deeply personal. I know how it feels, and I\u2019ve been there. Now I am at the Cabinet table, I am determined to deliver for the millions of people in the position I was once in.\u201d"

Put in context, this amounts to costing only 0.4% of the total \u00a31.3 trillion pay bill paid by UK businesses annually. The impact assessment also concludes the bill could have a direct and positive impact on economic growth, and by boosting protections and quality of work for the lowest paid, will help raise living standards for families and communities across the UK."
