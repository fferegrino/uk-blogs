We hope this will be more than a one-way conversation, with residents and visitors contributing to citizen science by sharing their own observations from these sites."

Just download the app and head out to your local river where you can follow the survey on your phone and answer questions about what you can see and how you feel. The Rivers Trust will use this information to help build a national picture of river health."
