It was the perfect job for me: I got to work in the field I was interested in, and as I worked Fridays to Mondays, my hours fitted around my childcare arrangements. I enjoyed working with people on probation and seeing them learn new skills and make progress towards turning their lives around. I was also very proud of the unpaid work my groups did in the community and the appreciation the public showed."

So, this job was a great route into the Probation Service and gaining experience of working with offenders. My initial training gave me a really good grounding in a range of subjects to help me work effectively and safely with them. Among other things, I learnt ways of dealing with people who were exhibiting challenging behaviour, and how to role model positive behaviours.\u201d"

Simple things like asking rather than telling people what to do is so important and helps to increase their motivation. In turn, people work more effectively as part of a team \u2013 a vital part of completing their unpaid work tasks while on CP."

You also need to be resilient and an active listener, alert to what\u2019s going on around you at all times and respond quickly and appropriately. A good sense of humour when things don\u2019t go quite to plan doesn\u2019t go amiss either.\u201d"

This involved managing a team of CP supervisors, allocating people on probation to their CP work placements, and ensuring people on my caseload turned up to do their unpaid work and completed their allocated hours. Having done the CP supervisor role myself, I knew what was expected of my team and what support they needed from me."

I also worked with other trainers to deliver CP training across the Probation Service. Currently, I'm National Senior Policy Lead, influencing the delivery of Community Payback services nationwide and I recently achieved\u00a0Ministry of Justice awards team finalist in May 2024."

I managed the region\u2019s Courts and Assessment team for a while. And, after that, I worked in the Ministry of Justice as the assistant private secretary to the prison and probation minister \u2013 an amazing and exciting role that I got because of my experience of working directly with people on probation while in my CP roles."

So, I\u2019m delighted my career has come full circle and I\u2019m back working in CP again \u2013 this time as the national senior policy lead, helping to shape the delivery of CP services and ensuring staff joining us have robust training to help them get the most out of their roles.\u201d\u00a0"
