It aims to provide our officers with hands-on operational experience, supporting their ability to regulate with greater understanding, credibility and confidence by undertaking short placements with participating waste companies. It also presents an opportunity for both us as the regulator, and regulated organisations to develop a shared understanding of waste regulation. This enables each to gain a greater appreciation of the problems and issues on both sides, allowing us to create a better place for people and wildlife while supporting sustainable development.\u00a0\u00a0"

The basis of the scheme is the belief that by working together in this way, standards in operation and regulation will improve with enhanced levels of compliance and environmental protection to the benefit all. However, we get much more out of the scheme than merely training regulators.\u202f We have also found that site operators receive as much valuable feedback from the process as our staff do from the operators.\u202f As with all good collaborations, the scheme is viewed as being mutually beneficial and leading to a better understanding of each other\u2019s needs and responsibilities.\u00a0"

Over the years, WIPS has subsequently become a long running and successful collaborative venture between ourselves, Environmental Services Association and Waste Industry Operators. Following the successful pilot in 1999, the scheme ran up until 2019 before having to temporarily close due to the covid19 pandemic. Such was the success and positive feedback from both the industry and Agency staff, the scheme was relaunched for 2024 in May, at an opening event in Birmingham."

We want to make sure our officers have the best skills, knowledge and experience to do their jobs effectively, so we are delighted to reinstate this scheme so that more people can benefit. We look forward to collaborating with the ESA and the waste industry on the scheme for years to come.\u201d\u00a0"

I have seen the challenges sites face around different types of waste as well as the risks posed by waste types such as gas bottles. The biggest lesson I have taken from this is that the types of waste coming into a plant have the most significant impact on the performance of the plant. I will be considering this more when performing my regulatory work at transfer stations as I will be stricter when it comes to assessing what waste types are being sent for incineration as I am now aware of the environmental impacts this can have.\u201d\u00a0"
