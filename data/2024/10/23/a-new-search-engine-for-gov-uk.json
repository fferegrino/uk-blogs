            "text": "Since GOV.UK was launched in 2012, site search has been powered by an open source search engine which we customised to suit our needs. Over the years, we\u2019ve worked hard on this customisation, experimenting with different ways to improve the relevance of results."

            "text": "To make sure our new search engine would deliver the best experience for users, we started by running a thorough review of search products on the market. Once initial research was completed, we built working prototypes of different search engines to understand the search engine features that would be most effective in helping us improve outcomes for users, and make it simplest to integrate with our existing technology infrastructure."
        },
        {
            "text": "We ran search queries on these prototypes and used judgement lists (sets of ratings for how relevant results are for a given search query) to review the quality of results. For further feedback, we also built a tool that let colleagues review and rate the prototypes\u2019 search results."

            "text": "It was clear from this research that the latest generation of semantic search products, particularly those that use large language models, were able to provide significant improvements in search relevance at scale. We chose Google\u2019s Vertex AI Search as the product that would best meet user needs both for relevance and ease of integration."

This was also an opportunity to simplify how we collect and process content from across GOV.UK for searching, since the new application has less complicated logic which is easier to understand and maintain."

        {
            "text": "Finally, we connected the search engine to anonymous data on how users are interacting with search (from users who have consented to analytics tracking). This allows it to improve search results over time, by learning which results are useful for which queries, based on what users are clicking on."

We extended and improved our judgement lists, built automated tests, and built a new tool to let colleagues rate results and report queries with result quality problems."
        },
        {
            "text": "Once we were confident in the quality of results, we started an A/B test on the live site. This test meant a random sample of GOV.UK users were shown results from the new search engine so we could compare its performance against the old search engine. We gradually ramped this test up to 50% of users (who had consented to analytics tracking) while closely monitoring the reliability of the system."

            "text": "We tracked a range of behavioural metrics over the A/B test, such as clickthrough (does the user click on a search result, and how high up is the result they click on?) and refinement (does the user change their search because they did not get the results they expected?)."

We\u2019re really pleased with the results we\u2019ve seen so far, which represent a significant improvement in the search experience for GOV.UK users.
