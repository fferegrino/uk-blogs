With almost 84,000km2 of ocean territory, the waters around Anguilla are integral to the island\u2019s economy, providing the foundation for key sectors such as tourism, fishing, and water sports. Pristine beaches and marine biodiversity attract global visitors, making tourism a critical industry. The sea also supports local livelihoods through fishing and recreational activities like diving and snorkelling. As such, the waters around Anguilla are a valuable resource for achieving sustainable economic development, bringing positive benefits for both people and the environment. However, Anguilla\u2019s marine environment faces several challenges, including the impacts of climate change, overfishing, pollution, and coastal development, all of which threaten the sustainability of these resources.\u00a0"

Delivered effectively, MSP will ensure the sustainable use of marine resources by balancing competing interests such as tourism, fishing, and conservation. It ensures that the right activities are developed in the right place and in the right way, helping to avoid conflicts between different activities, reducing impacts to marine habitats and wildlife, and providing benefits to local communities. MSP will also enhance the island\u2019s resilience to climate change by safeguarding coral reefs and mangroves that act as natural buffers. By identifying key areas for protection and managing economic activities like fishing and shipping, MSP will foster economic stability and ensure that Anguilla\u2019s marine ecosystems remain healthy and productive for future generations.\u00a0"

This includes information about the different habitats and species found within Anguilla\u2019s marine area.

Workshop participants highlighted data (for example, where key marine habitats and species occur and how the marine area is used) they hold that could inform the MSP process and also identified additional stakeholders who should be involved. Participatory mapping was undertaken during four of the workshops. Participants marked on maps where different activities currently occur in Anguilla\u2019s marine and coastal zone and areas where there are conflicts between these activities. The workshops also discussed the possible locations for a pilot study to allow MSP principles to be tested and applied to address the issues in the chosen area. The lessons learnt from this pilot study will then be used to prepare the marine spatial plan for Anguilla in subsequent years.\u00a0\u00a0"
