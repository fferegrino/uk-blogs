The Centre forecasts for all natural forms of flooding including from rivers, surface water, groundwater and the sea.\u00a0\u00a0They are a key link between Met Office Strategic Operations Centre and the EA\u2019s Local Forecasting Centres and have been successfully running now for 15 years."

We know from the past year and last month why this work is so important. The visit coincides with the one year anniversary of Storm Babet, which brought significant flooding across the country and saw the third wettest three-day period in a series for England and Wales since 1891. Nearly 96,900 properties were protected by the Environment Agency during Storm Babet, though sadly around 2,150 were flooded.\u00a0 And in the last month, heavy rainfall led to the first major incident of the season with almost a thousand properties flooded. It followed the wettest 18 months on record in England up to February 2024. \u202fClimate Change is happening now.\u00a0"

Our people at the FFC work hard to monitor our weather and understand the likelihood of flooding. They issue guidance to emergency responders and forecasts that help our Environment Agency staff issue flood alerts and warnings and work with our partners to help communities respond.\u00a0\u00a0"

Early results from the trial are incredibly positive. Further research will assess the value of the trial to the response community and government. This will inform recommendations for the future of the service for 2025 and beyond. The RFG trial is part of the Surface Water Flood Forecasting Improvement Project, a 3-year Defra and Environment Agency\u00a0 funded initiative, completing in March 2026. Its an example of the strategic leadership we provide on surface water where we\u2019re proactively providing more information and training to local authorities and partners.\u00a0We are also collaborating with the Met Office looking ahead to the future and reviewing the environmental risks on the National Security Risk Register (NSRA).\u00a0"

It allows us and our emergency responders to reach anyone with a mobile phone in a certain location, if there is a \u2018risk to life\u2019. This was used for the first time after a severe Flood Warning and Emergency Alert were issued in the early hours of Thursday 23rd May for Highbridge and Stokedalewath (small hamlets on River Roe, South of Carlisle)."

And remember never walk or drive through floodwater.\u00a0Some of these small actions can reduce your risk and help avoid years of financial costs and mental stress.\u00a0\u00a0"
