The ability to share data is critical for driving innovation, improving decision-making, and fostering collaboration. This is a perennial cross-government challenge as many different departments have to go through lengthy processes to share data sets. Our Chief Data Architect for Government, Jenny Brooker, hosted a data sharing panel, with GCHQ, Cabinet Office and NHS England. The panel discussed the cultural, technical and regulatory barriers to data sharing, and offered solutions, including creating a shared platform for data sharing, and advocating for buy-in from senior stakeholders."

This panel discussion explored why data catalogues are needed, and how to develop them on a budget. Hosted by Douglas Ward, from PwC, it included panellists from British Council, Ordnance Survey, and Department for Business and Trade. Another panel debate which proved popular explored how Gen AI application was being put into practice across various government departments. This session was hosted by Craig Suckling, and panellists included: Dr Amanda Svensson, from the Government Communication Service, who discussed 'a new way to communicate: The role of data in empowering GCS's AI tooling'; Ganesh Sethi, from Government Digital Service, who talked about 'ask analytics: democratising data insights with Generative AI for GOV.UK'; and Steve Kingston, from Ordnance Survey, who explored 'the AI of where: unleashing the power of grid index systems and foundation machine learning models on Geospatial Data.'"
