This blog offers a behind-the-scenes look at the work involved, the challenges faced, and the solutions crafted along the way, ultimately leading to a successful and innovative outcome for the Dogs Unit and their users. There are currently 946 dogs in service across HMPPS and over 800 dog handlers, the dogs perform various tasks from patrolling areas and ensuring security to searching for and detecting contraband."

For this, we worked closely with the supplier. We navigated the complexities of networking changes, system specifications and organisational security requirements around secure systems and access for 3rd parties. We provided technical setup details and collaborated at every step to ensure the VMs met what was needed."

One of the most significant challenges arose when we discovered a firewall separating our development (DEV) and production (PROD) environments. Our original plan to deploy test Virtual Machines (VMs) in the DEV environment so that Dogs unit users could be trained in a totally safe place where no cross contamination of data to prod was a risk. The firewall made this unworkable, users simply couldn\u2019t access the Test VMs due to the firewall restrictions."

Our solution was to set up staging VMs in the production environment instead and to implement guard rails that would protect any test data reaching prod. There was close coordination and adherence to MoJ processes as we migrated the resources we had already created from the DEV to PROD environment."

Working with colleagues in Platforms & Architecture and Networks was crucial as we navigated DNS updates, certificate changes and firewall routing. The end result is an environment users can use with complete confidence that whatever they do won't impact prod. This did impact on the overall timeline but thanks to our honesty and transparency, training date and roll out plans were accommodated for. "

The new system isn't just an upgrade, it represents a complete transformation, providing seamless access, improved functionality, and better security."
