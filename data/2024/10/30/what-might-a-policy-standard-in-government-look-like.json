Government services are the result of policy decisions, and do not operate in a vacuum. But when designers collaborate with policymakers, they may find that they are alone in their familiarity with the Service Standard. Those who create policy are not required to follow it or understand its importance to designers.\u00a0"

This puts the onus on designers to follow these principles, rather than on policymakers to create the necessary conditions for well-designed services.\u00a0"
