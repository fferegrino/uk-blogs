I'm particularly interested in how we can use digital, data and AI across the government. We have amazing digital teams in the public sector, and the technology continues to move at pace, so we have no idea what we\u2019ll be doing with the tech in the future; but that\u2019s pretty exciting because we're going to discover it together."

            "text": "I started as a graduate in a HEO software engineering job. Over the years, through building technology, running technology teams and designing new digital services, I began to care about the technology people agenda. I was asking questions like \u2018who are we going to recruit into digital?\u2019 and \u2018how are we going to look after our digital people?\u2019 which led me into a bunch of roles, and I'm now a senior civil servant thinking about our ambitions for the digital architecture of government in the future. I\u2019d love for people reading this to take away that you can be a deep technologist and be a senior civil servant, using your technical skills every day."

            "text": "What advice can I share? One of the most powerful tools is coaching: I can rattle off a list of people that I'm super proud to have grown, who have got promoted within the Civil Service and are now grade 7s and grade 6s. There's even one who is now a Chief Technology Officer. I\u2019ve coached individuals during some of the hardest decisions in their career, and it's really rewarding to see them flourish now."

You can see all the roles available there, and various routes into them including apprenticeships and Fast Stream opportunities. It\u2019s an exciting time to join Government Digital and Data - the community that drives digital transformation in government.\u00a0\u00a0Digital colleagues are a crucial part of every Civil Service department, whether you\u2019re analysing attendance data at schools or designing technology to read passports. On top of these technical roles, you can be a leader. There is an exciting offer for digital people who want to get more senior and the Modern Civil Service supports that. You can also subscribe to our Central Digital and Data blog and follow us on LinkedIn to find out all the latest digital transformation news happening across government."
