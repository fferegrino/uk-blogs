This will continue while I develop in my role. We inspect the wastewater treatment works and assess compliance with the site\u2019s environmental permit which sets out conditions under which the site can discharge treated effluent into the river. We take photographs, reference the permit and ask questions about on-site operations and maintenance as we go along. We are assessing if the site is compliant with the permit and looking for any breaches of the conditions."

A plume of discoloured water, odour, sewage fungus or foam are some things that could indicate issues with the quality of the final effluent discharged to the river."
