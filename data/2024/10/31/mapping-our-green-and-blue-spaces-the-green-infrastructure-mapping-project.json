The update also adds new data to support nature recovery and look at the proportion of green cover in urban areas. Two new maps show data from the People and Nature Survey: perceptions of improvement of local greenspace and visits to them in the last 14 days. For some cities, including Greater Manchester, the update incorporates some experimental data. This includes new maps of urban habitats, urban heat, air quality and urban food production. These give more data for developing local nature recovery strategies and show how green infrastructure meets communities' needs. Including this data will support future development, to potentially roll out these maps over more areas."

This supports libraries to help people rediscover nature, enhance their wellbeing and contribute to nature recovery in urban landscapes. It also funds nature connection training for library staff so that they can run nature engagement activities. The project uses the green infrastructure mapping database to generate interest, exchange information and consider opportunities for local landscapes. Between September 2024 and March 2025, they will work with up to 30 libraries across England."
