That\u2019s where a community designer, like myself, comes in; to build relationships with our users, find out their needs, and work with the team to design solutions. I\u2019m there after things have gone live too, checking that things have landed as intended, feeding back to the team if they haven\u2019t. A community designer is there for the whole user journey but where the community is the service."

After all, most of the components and patterns that sit in our product are contributed by external users. We have an impartial, external panel of experts that make up the GOV.UK Design System Working Group, that have the final say on whether components and patterns are ready to launch. We also now co-design all our components and patterns, running collaborative kick-off sessions, ideations, crits and launches."

It is our highlight event of the year, and that\u2019s why we insist on putting our community members front and centre. We essentially create a stage for our community to showcase their work and skills. Every talk is user-pitched, drafted and delivered; much like any other contribution to the design system. The agenda is shaped by the community, for the community, and we love being able to give people that agency."
