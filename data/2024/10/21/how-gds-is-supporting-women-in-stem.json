They especially focus on working with girls from lower income and minority backgrounds.\u00a0"

Their mission is \u201cto inspire today's girls in education to be tomorrow's women in tech\u201d. As a woman who has been on that journey myself, I wanted to get involved to bring opportunities I didn\u2019t have in the past to the next generation of female digital and technology specialists."

            "text": "In the UK, Next Tech Girls statistics show that there is currently a huge gender gap in STEM careers, with women severely underrepresented. Women are much less likely to enter into a STEM career path due to a number of factors. "

        {
            "text": "This can range from the stereotypes of it being a predominantly male career path (I was one of the only girls on my own university computer science degree out of approximately 100, which was intimidating), issues with a lack of role models and visibility of women working in tech, to a lack of advocacy and support in school to pursue these types of careers in the first place.

            "text": "We learnt that the students were especially interested in our individual career paths, what qualifications we each had, what helped us get to where we currently were in our career, and what a day in the life of different disciplines looked like, especially what it was like to work in a modern office environment.\u00a0"

This led to putting together a team of designers, developers, delivery managers, data scientists, and leadership roles to spend some time throughout the week giving the students a variety of perspectives.

It was important to respect the time of our volunteers, but also give the students a bit of time to learn from people, then go off and complete some self-directed activities and tasks. The challenge here was not making it too much like the school environment, and exposing them in a safe way to a work environment where they had to use their initiative to develop their own skills."

        {
            "text": "We kicked the week off with an introduction from myself to GDS and our unique history. I then gave a brief overview of my education and career to date, what I enjoyed and what I found a challenge. This format was used by most of our volunteers to give an insight into how different people approached their careers, followed by some hands-on activities and experience. I also set them a task for the week of summarising what they learned during their time with us, to present back on the Friday afternoon."

This was the highlight of the week for me, as not only was it an energetic presentation from the girls, but seeing the sheer amount of things they learned about and put into practice over such a short time that week was incredible. They told us they really enjoyed the week and have a good idea of what to do next to start out in their careers."

            "text": "We learned it was so important to have a strict agenda to stick to, to give confidence that the students would have a good mix of taught and self-directed learning, and to see the spread of disciplines and activities they would be doing. It was also useful to set up a Slack channel for all volunteers to keep in touch with, and in case of emergencies.\u00a0"

We had to remember that they weren\u2019t familiar with many of the daily aspects of work we take for granted as experienced STEM professionals."
