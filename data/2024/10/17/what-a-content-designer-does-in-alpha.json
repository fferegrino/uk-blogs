You\u2019ll act as an advocate for user needs, analysing evidence to distinguish what\u2019s true about your service and what\u2019s assumed. You might run riskiest assumption testing (RAT), which helps surface uncertainty about your service, users or delivery plan."

We put these in front of users as a sounding board to understand their needs. This helped us get clearer feedback from subject matter experts, and stopped them from latching on to designs that we might not move forward with. We only started using the GOV.UK Prototyping Kit once we had a higher level of confidence about the direction of our service."

Show them your work-in-progress. You\u2019ll get clearer feedback and move faster. It\u2019s important to keep a record of this feedback and what changes you made afterward. Documenting each iteration will help you trace design decisions."

Although you\u2019ll run accessibility testing in beta phase, it\u2019s important to work with guidelines in mind during alpha too. For example, do not design a component that will not work for a screen reader, or use language that could exclude some users \u2013 even if you\u2019re just trying it out for a test."

Part of alpha is understanding the constraints and limits to your service. It\u2019s a good use of time and resources to come to this decision. In fact, testing things out and pivoting is the whole point of alpha."
