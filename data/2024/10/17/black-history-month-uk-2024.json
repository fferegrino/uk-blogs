His work has implications for understanding diseases such as cancer and infections. He has conducted post-doctoral work at Cancer Research UK and Imperial College London, contributing to advancements in cancer research and is currently an Associate Professor in Immunology at Royal Veterinary College, University of London.\u00a0Dr Palmer is also co-founder of Reach Society, an award-winning social enterprise\u00a0that aims at inspiring young black people, especially boys and young men, to realise their potential in various fields, including science. His work has had a lasting impact on the field of immunology and continues to inspire future generations of scientists. Hear about his story in his own words on this short You Tube\u00a0clip."

        {
            "text": "McCoy is best known for inventing an automatic lubricator for steam engines. This device allowed trains and other machinery to be lubricated while in operation, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the need for maintenance stops. Over his lifetime, McCoy was awarded 57 U.S. patents, many of which were related to lubrication systems. His inventions were so effective that the familiar term, \u201cthe real McCoy\u201d became synonymous with authenticity and high quality. His work had a profound impact on the railroad industry and other sectors that relied on heavy machinery. His innovations helped pave the way for more efficient industrial operations and set a high standard for engineering excellence."

            "text": "Although he was born in the United States, Dr Carruthers\u2019 contributions had a significant impact globally, including in the UK. He is best known for inventing the ultraviolet camera/spectrograph, which was used during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. This device captured images of Earth\u2019s outer atmosphere and deep space objects in ultraviolet light, providing valuable data for space research. Dr Carruthers\u2019 invention was pivotal in advancing our understanding of space and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. His work has been recognised with numerous awards, and his contributions continue to inspire scientists and engineers worldwide. Find out more about him at the National Air and Sace Museum website."
