            "text": "We started at Wroxham where we found two young anglers enjoying their summer holidays on the riverbank. We stopped to see if they had caught anything and asked their ages. One was 13 which meant he needed a fishing licence, which he had. The junior fishing licence is free for those between 13 and 16 years old. The other angler was 12 so therefore didn\u2019t need a licence but he was keen to order one in a few weeks\u2019 time when he turned 13. It\u2019s lovely to see young anglers and interact with them."

            "text": "We travelled from Wroxham down to Salhouse, keeping our eyes peeled for anglers.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t long before we saw an angler, so we approached him on the boat and chatted to him about his catches before checking his licence. He had the correct senior licence and is a regular angler on the broads. It is important to us to build good relationships with the anglers. We continued our journey onto Woodbastwick, where we found two more anglers and were pleased to find they had correct valid licences."

            "text": "Salhouse Broad was our next stop.\u00a0 We found three more anglers all with valid licences \u2013  two of them were on holiday in Norfolk. It is always nice to see people visiting the Broads from further afield who enjoy fishing.\u00a0 We moved onto Black Horse Broad but found no anglers before travelling to Horning Broad.\u00a0 We checked three more anglers who all had valid fishing licences and were pleased to see us out and checking them!"

            "text": "As we had been out patrolling for nearly five hours at this point, we started our return journey back to Wroxham.\u00a0 We saw another angler who was fishing legally but then the last angler of the day was fishing without a licence, so I issued him with an Offence Report Form (ORF).\u00a0 While I was completing the details, they purchased a one-day fishing licence (just \u00a37.10) and I added this detail onto the report.\u00a0 I don\u2019t decide what happens next \u2013 this is determined by our Enforcement Once Team and may involve prosecution with a fine up to \u00a32,500.\u00a0 Fishing without a valid rod licence is a criminal offence and if dealt with by the courts, you\u2019re likely to end up with a criminal record."

            "text": "Is fishing without a licence worth the risk?\u00a0 No!\u00a0 A day licence can be as little as \u00a37.10 (the price increases if you are salmon or sea trout fishing) whilst an annual licence starts at \u00a323.80 for a senior and \u00a335.80 for an adult licence. Again, the price can increase depending on how many rods you have and the type of fishing you want to do. The price for a licence is far cheaper than the fine and prevents you from having a criminal record. Income from fishing licence sales is used to fund vital work to improve and protect our fish and fisheries. Income generated is invested directly back into our angling community, improving fish stocks, boosting opportunities for anglers as well as undertaking fisheries enforcement, habitat improvement and fish rescues when needed."

            "text": "Rod licence checking isn\u2019t the only element to my job.\u00a0 The Environment Agency has a 24-hour 7-days a week incident hotline number which members of the public can use to report any illegal fishing to us - the Hotline number 0800 80 70 60. I am on a roster alongside other FEOs, which means I receive, assess and deal with reports of illegal fishing.\u00a0 This is an important duty as the public uses our hotline to report fish being taken from rivers and fisheries, illegal nets / traps and more.\u00a0 Some days are busier than others but whatever plans I had before the phone rings are put to one side as these reports often mean there is a danger to the fishes\u2019 life and welfare."

            "text": "I visit various lakes and fisheries, using intelligence we have gathered or from reports made by members of the public.\u00a0 Using this intelligence means we can target the locations across East Anglia where anglers are potentially evading the law. I patrol two to four locations a day depending on how many anglers are present and how many licences there are to check.\u00a0 Recently, I attended a lake and there were 76 anglers, so as you can imagine that took some time to check them all!\u00a0 I found three fishing without a rod licence and issued each with an Offence Report Form.\u00a0 Sometimes, an angler will have a valid fishing licence but won\u2019t have it with them, or they panic because they can\u2019t find their digital licence in their emails. This isn\u2019t a problem, because we have a phone app we can use to find a fishing licence as a last resort.\u00a0 I always advise anglers to have their licence handy before they get on the riverbank, so it\u2019s easy to find if you\u2019re asked for it."
