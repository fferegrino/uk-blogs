            "text": "Mass spectrometry, a technique at the core of Robinson\u2019s work, enables scientists to analyse molecules such as proteins by measuring their mass and interactions. This tool has become pivotal in understanding how proteins behave in various disease states, specifically by detecting abnormal protein interactions that may signify disease development. Robinson explains that mass spectrometry allows researchers to examine proteins\u2019 \u201cclumping\u201d behaviour. This can indicate changes in molecular interactions that could be precursors to conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases or cancer."

            "text": "Robinson\u2019s work focuses on examining these molecular structures intact, avoiding the high-energy fragmentation that often characterises traditional mass spectrometry methods. By preserving protein interactions, her research has provided new insights into disease mechanisms, particularly in diseases where proteins aggregate or interact abnormally. Her team\u2019s ability to gently probe these interactions has led to the identification of potential drug targets. This significantly impacts biomedical research and health outcomes."

Despite having no prior knowledge of mass spectrometry, she was drawn to the complexity and hands-on nature of the technology. As Robinson progressed in her career, she developed a passion for the technique and dedicated her work to uncovering its full potential. Robinson went on to study chemistry at Swansea, Oxford and Cambridge universities."

            "text": "The significance of her research is not only recognised through prestigious awards but also through practical applications in the healthcare sector. Robinson co-founded OMass Therapeutics, a spin-out company based on her lab\u2019s research that has successfully raised over $100 million in investment. The company holds multiple patents and focuses on translating mass spectrometry innovations into new therapies for unmet medical needs. This achievement underscores the real-world impact of Robinson\u2019s work and her dedication to bridging the gap between laboratory research and clinical application."
