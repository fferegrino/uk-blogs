A REM system typically consists of sensors and cameras collecting various data (video, GPS etc.), that can then be interpreted to generate information on when and where a vessel is fishing and what it is catching.\u00a0\u00a0"

As part of delivering this, Defra plans to expand the use of REM in English waters over the next five years. The introduction of REM, initially in selected priority fisheries, demonstrates Defra\u2019s commitment to addressing data gaps and concerns that have been highlighted in relation to fishing activity in English waters. Working with \u2018early adopters\u2019 in each priority fishery will enable us to refine our objectives for using REM, and the approaches which work best for fishers allowing us to meet our data needs.\u00a0"

Following the completion of the installation, the vessel set sail for its maiden REM voyage."

During this time, we will continue to refine our approaches and ways of working to ensure that when mandatory REM requirements are introduced, these are fit for purpose."
