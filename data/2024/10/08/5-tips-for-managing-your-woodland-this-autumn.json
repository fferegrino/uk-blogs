If you\u2019re using machinery, be careful that it doesn\u2019t cause soil compaction around tree roots."

            "text": "With the leaves off most broadleaf trees and some conifers, such as larch, it can sometimes be more difficult to detect signs of ill health in the trees. Look for those holding on to their dead leaves as this can be a good indicator that they have died. You can also keep a close eye on the bark for lesions and weeping as well as looking to the crown for dying twiggy branches."

        {
            "text": "Autumn is probably the best time for fungi, all of which are fascinating and play a key role in the woodland ecosystem, recycling nutrients and helping trees to take up soil minerals. Some, however, particularly those growing on the wood of living trees, can be a sign that the tree is diseased or dying. So if those trees are located where could pose a safety risk, have them checked by a qualified tree safety inspector or arboriculturist."

            "text": "As a woodland owner you need to protect your trees from pests and diseases and simple biosecurity measures can stop them being introduced. Ask any visitors to clean their shoes and vehicles before entering your woodland and once they leave. Falling leaves can carry fungal diseases in the leaf litter and this prevents it spreading."
