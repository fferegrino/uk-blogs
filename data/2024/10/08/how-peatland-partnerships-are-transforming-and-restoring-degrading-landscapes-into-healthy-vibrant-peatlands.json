They are also valuable carbon dioxide stores and home to a rich variety of rare wildlife. When in good condition, these peatlands help fight climate change and provide wider environmental benefits."

These partnerships are place-based coalitions of National Parks, National Landscapes, environmental charities and other groups united by a passion for restoring peatland. They coordinate conservation efforts at a regional level, and act as local champions for peatland restoration.\u00a0"

On a site visit last year, I saw how they had transformed a vast expanse of bare peat, scarred by acid rain from the industrial revolution, into a vibrant, healthy blanket bog, rich in peat forming sphagnum moss."

They are restoring peat on an active firing range. Their approach brings together landowners and graziers\u00a0so that everyone can benefit. I enjoyed seeing tonnes of stone being carried over the moor by helicopter to block drainage channels, raise the water table and restore the bog. "

Over the winter, I visited some of their sites and saw first-hand the expertise of the partnership staff. They play an important role in planning and directing works on the ground, working with contractors like Jonny, who previously wrote about a day in his life for this blog."

            "text": "And on a visit to Dorset Peat Partnership, I learnt about the challenges around maintaining peatlands near urban areas. Peatlands are vulnerable to wildfire, and the risk of this is increased near population centres because of activities like barbecues and bonfires. The site I visited had suffered a significant fire in 2022, and local partners had installed a fire hydrant system to mitigate further blazes. Urban peatlands also face pressure from increased recreation, and housing expansion."

They have surveyed thousands of hectares of habitat, laying the groundwork for restoration projects. This autumn, they are working with a local farmer to restore a degraded bog with funding from the Countryside Stewardship scheme. Farming schemes will play a pivotal role in supporting the restoration of peat and helping us meet our net zero targets."
