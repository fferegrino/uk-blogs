Traditional federated learning enables scaling to extremely large training datasets by leveraging distributed computing power; adding privacy-preserving techniques can introduce new scalability challenges specific to PPFL.\u00a0"

            "text": "A major challenge of scaling PPFL systems to large datasets and many clients comes from the computational challenges of the cryptography used to implement PPFL defenses. Techniques like fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC) can protect sensitive computations, but often introduce significant performance overhead. In addition, practical PPFL systems often need to work with heterogeneous clients that have different data and computational abilities. The UK-US Prize Challenges were designed to not only test whether solutions offered a strong level of privacy, but also to establish whether they could achieve performance that was practical in real world applications at scale. We asked some of the winners about the scalability challenges that they had to address, and about how the way data is distributed impacts the solutions.\u00a0"

This includes data that is horizontally distributed, such as data across different hospitals who each have their own patients, as well as data that is vertically distributed such as in scenarios where a patient's data is distributed across multiple entities (hospitals, companies, labs, etc.). While current literature primarily focuses on horizontal distribution scenarios, less focus has been on vertical or arbitrary distributions. Solutions based on cryptography, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption, do work for arbitrary partitions but incur significant computational costs. Developing more efficient algorithms, protocols and tools capable of handling large-scale datasets and complex models is crucial for practical applications with arbitrary partitions.\u00a0"

It's not a straightforward case where increasing the number of participants always leads to better results, nor does reducing them necessarily improve outcomes. There appears to be an optimal point in terms of the number of parties involved in the training process, which maximises the training accuracy.
