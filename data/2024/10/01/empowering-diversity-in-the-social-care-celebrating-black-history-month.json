It also gives us time to reflect on the ongoing need to create more inclusive and equitable opportunities within organisations, teams, spaces and communities - particularly in the rapidly evolving field of digital in social care."

These figures roundup to a quarter of the workforce being from an ethnic minority background. Likewise, international employees make up 19% of the adult social care workforce, meaning one in five workers in England are non-UK citizens. ."

            "text": "Despite being in a diverse industry, black professionals (especially women) continue to face barriers in entering and advancing in the digital space. Examples include underrepresentation in leadership roles and limited access to mentorship and development opportunities. These obstacles must be dismantled to create a more inclusive workforce that reflects the diversity of the population it serves."

It provides networking, mentorship, coaching, and professional development opportunities. It also provides the Digital Fellowship which equips women of colour with tools, training, and support needed for leadership roles."

Thanks to the network, I received a bursary to attend the Digital Health Summer School and became one of the first cohort of Social Care Digital Fellows."

However, we must also look to the future and acknowledge the work that remains to be done. I would like to encourage you to join initiatives like the Shuri Network either as a member or an ally because itis crucial in building a digital workforce that is not only skilled, diverse and dynamic but also representative of the communities it serves.By supporting diversity and inclusion in social care, we can ensure that the digital transformation and revolution benefits everyone. We must ensure that future generations of black professionals and women of colour have the opportunities they deserve to lead, transform and innovate in our organisations."
