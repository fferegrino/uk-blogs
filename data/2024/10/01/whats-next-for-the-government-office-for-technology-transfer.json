            "text": "Looking back on the last 2 and a half years that I\u2019ve been leading the organisation, I am really proud of how far GOTT has come and most importantly, the impact we have had supporting the public sector to identify, protect and exploit its Knowledge Assets. At the time, the term \u201cKnowledge Assets\u201d was quite novel, covering intellectual property and other intangible assets such as data and know-how. I quickly found that it resonated well with many in the public sector who feel that their stock in trade is the creation of new knowledge. It\u2019s encouraging to see this language is now beginning to be recognised more broadly."
        },
        {
            "text": "As GOTT, we\u2019ve gone from a small unit focused on building the foundations and establishing a team to a confident and maturing one that is getting good traction across our public sector client base. We\u2019ve developed our support services to help identify and develop promising Knowledge Assets and to upskill potential innovators, offering advice, hands-on support and access to a developing suite of guidance documents. We now have a catalogue of over 200 Knowledge Assets and we\u2019ve funded over 130 proof of concept projects in more than 40 organisations in areas as diverse as health, defence, museums and the environment. "

            "text": "We\u2019re helping leading public sector organisations to develop a joined-up Knowledge Asset Management Strategy and have created a cross-government \u201cKnowledge Asset Network\u201d which has grown to over 200 members. But don\u2019t just take my word for it. I am pleased to share an independent report published today that provides good evidence of how GOTT is helping to drive innovation in the public sector for the benefit of the citizen and economy. The findings underline the value of Knowledge Asset exploitation and confirms GOTT\u2019s important role in driving change in the way in which the government\u2019s Knowledge Assets are managed. Looking at the design and delivery of GOTT, the report shows the progress made towards realising early outcomes. It recognises that it\u2019s still early days and that the task is long-term and gives confidence that we can build on a really good start."

            "text": "So, what's next for GOTT? Firstly, more of the same. We know how well our grant funding and tech transfer support has been received. There\u2019s been great interest in learning through our recently launched skills programmes and through peer-to-peer support through the Knowledge Asset Network and our events. Our guidance has been co-developed with valued stakeholders and we have more in the pipeline, responding to where the greatest demand lies."

            "text": "Knowledge Asset management is an important contributor to the government\u2019s economic growth mission. Getting Knowledge Assets created in the public sector developed and out to the market helps stimulate productivity and growth, creating and retaining high quality jobs and enabling more people to benefit from the fantastic innovations coming out of government. To support this objective, our work will have a greater focus on the commercialisation of Knowledge Assets. We\u2019re looking at additional ways that we can enhance the support we offer, helping to increase Knowledge Assets.
