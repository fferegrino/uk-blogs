First, fellow travellers in the world of service design who might want to know more about this conference, in case they are considering going in future. Second, colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) who are perhaps not too connected with service design, but who want to know what those people do all day. \u00a0"

This ranged across everything from the design of ballot papers, to voting booths, to possible futures of electronic voting, and much more besides. \u00a0\u00a0In-between sessions I spoke with: Anne-Louise, head of a new service design team working for local authorities in Yorkshire; Sophie, a designer working on health services at a university hospital in London; Joe, a student in Scotland completing a User Experience (UX) Masters degree; and Ian, Head of Department for Service Design at a nearby university. I also of course got to meet some of my MHCLG colleagues for the first time (I only joined in September) and even hear about some of the design work that has taken place in the department in recent years. \u00a0"

The BOPS case study allowed us to evaluate ODP from the other side, to understand how third-party designers, government designers, and local government can all work together to solve large complex problems. It would have been great to hear from one of the collaborating local authorities themselves, to pick up on any differences in their own perspective, but we can\u2019t have everything! \u202fI am informed that there are regular public show and tell sessions so we can all follow the progress there.\u00a0"
