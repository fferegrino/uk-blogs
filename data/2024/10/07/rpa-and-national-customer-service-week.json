One of the ways RPA gathers feedback on our approach to customer service is by attending shows and events across the country. "

Visiting our stand is often the only face-to-face contact that many people have with RPA. For us, being able to meet farmers and agents allows us to gain insight and feedback that we can use to further shape the way we work, or the way we write guidance and design processes."

But it\u2019s not just farmers and agents. Networking is a big part of being on the RPA stand. We mainly share the stand with Defra when we attend shows and it\u2019s good listening to them, as I\u2019ve learnt so much\"."
