Without adequate preparation, many parts of our everyday lives wouldn\u2019t be possible. So how do you feel about your water supply at home and at work? Do you know how much you use? It\u2019s easy to think that the water we use from the tap will always be there, but without a vast amount of planning and work, the answer is, it won\u2019t."

If we look around the world, we can see the devastating impacts lack of water can have upon a country\u2019s population, chances of survival and economic success. In England, we face a shortfall of nearly 5 billion litres* of water per day by 2050 between the available, sustainable water supplies and expected demand. It\u2019s vital that we plan and prepare for our water needs now to ensure we have enough in the future."

            "text": "An essential part of our role at the Environment Agency is to advise water companies and the Government on effectively planning for the future. By law, every five years, water companies must produce Water Resources Management Plans (WRMPs) which set out how they intend to deliver our water security and protection of the environment for the next 25 years, in their supply area. These plans are a positive step forward as, upon implementation, they should improve resilience to extreme droughts, serve a thriving economy and improve the environment allowing fish and wildlife to flourish. We play a crucial role in this, using our specialist knowledge to set technical guidance, respond to draft plans and advise the Secretary of State on their suitability."

It\u2019s a challenge we never stop thinking about. Actions taken by the water industry in the next 12 months, and towards 2030, will be critical to ensuring there is a plentiful and sustainable water supply across England over the coming decades. This is very much a living and agile process which needs to be clearly regulated, which is why, every twelve months, water companies have a statutory duty to report on the progress of their water resources management plans. It\u2019s our job to check that progress and ensure the plans are robust and fit for purpose."

This is the only independent summary and analysis of water resources performance across the sector, providing transparency, greater accountability, and driving evidence-based decisions. This year\u2019s report shows some progress, but highlights areas of significant under delivery which require greater focus from the industry to meet future demand."

It\u2019s positive to see demand and leakage has reduced in 2023/24 from the previous year, however the weather will have been a key factor, due to people using less water, particularly outdoors. The industry needs to ensure the reductions continue and are sustained under drier and more challenging conditions. There is a wide range of existing and emerging innovative ways water companies can reduce leakage. This includes activities such as pipe replacements, smart metering and smart monitoring of networks, and specific activities to help locate and fix leaks such as the use of acoustic logging, satellite imagery, drones and sniffer dogs that can pinpoint leaks."

            "text": "Reducing the demand for water from customers, known as demand management, is another critical element for water companies in their efforts to meet the supply/demand balance and encourage efficient use of the increasingly scarce resource. This will particularly depend on effective smart metering and customer engagement alongside national policy initiatives such as the mandatory water efficiency label and Ofwat\u2019s proposed national water efficiency campaign. Not only is reducing demand important for the long-term management of water, but it is also hugely beneficial to society; it means less water being taken from the environment, less water and wastewater being pumped and treated, and reduces the need for new supplies to meet growth. This translates into fewer carbon emissions, lower costs and a healthier more sustainable environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
