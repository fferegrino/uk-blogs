The key is to gather information about them in advance, so that you can tailor your approach to what they care about. When giving a presentation, for example to stakeholders, listen to your audience\u2019s questions and feedback. Encourage differing views. This will help you engage and demonstrate that you value their input. Listening to your audience, not just in the interests of gathering information, will help you create an impactful message."

Be mindful of distracting habits such as fidgeting with hands, hair or clothes. Recording yourself and reviewing your body language is a good way to make improvements. Consider the message you want to convey \u2013 whether authoritative or passive \u2013 and adapt your style.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "You should also pay close attention to your audience's body language. This will allow you to understand how your message is being received.\u00a0 For example, in a research session, you may notice that a participant is uncomfortable or distressed. You can then adapt your body language to help put them at ease by smiling and relaxing your hands. Ensuring theparticipant is comfortable helps them open up and give real insights to how your product or service makes them feel. Remember, the way you carry yourself not only affects how others perceive you but can also influence how you feel."
