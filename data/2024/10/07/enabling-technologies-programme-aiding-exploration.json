At the UK Space Agency, our Enabling Technologies Programme (ETP) funds national efforts to drive innovation in exploration and human space activity, in-orbit and beyond."

The project involves development of alternative motion techniques for exploration missions, expanding the range and set of operating capabilities for extra-terrestrial robotic missions. Project lead\u00a0 Dr Kate Smith shared the below updates on how their jumping robot design might explore lava tubes on the moon:"
