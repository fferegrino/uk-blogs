To recognise this milestone, we have updated our summary of the committee\u2019s history (originally published in 2019 to commemorate the committee\u2019s 10th anniversary). The new version can be found on our website \u2013 here."

We are proud to have helped successive governments to improve the evidence-base and analysis underpinning regulatory proposals and through this to help them improve the quality of their policy choices."

We welcome the new Secretary of State\u2019s comment (in his foreword to our recent recruitment campaign) that: \u201cThe Government is committed to the role the Better Regulation Framework plays in ensuring that regulatory decisions are based on evidence and sees the RPC's role as a key part of the process. The Committee will continue to be critical in informing our approach to regulation\u201d."
