Bringing in legislation won\u2019t force anyone to use a digital identity. Instead, the proposed new law will create a legislative structure of standards, governance and oversight for organisations that provide \u2018digital verification services\u2019 (which is what digital identities are called in the Bill) and want to be registered as a trusted service. \u00a0\u00a0"
