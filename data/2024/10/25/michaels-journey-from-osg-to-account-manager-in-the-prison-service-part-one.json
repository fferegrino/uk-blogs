Michael now helps drive improvements across some of the most challenging prison sites."

I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore, and my dad, who used to work in the Prison Service, told me there were OSG jobs available at HMP Rochester. So, I signed up for it. I managed to get through, but it was only a temporary role at first. After four months, I secured a permanent job.\u00a0"

If an alarm bell rang, I had to ensure staff were sent to the right place with the right instructions. It was a lot of responsibility, but knowing I was contributing to the safe and smooth running of the prison was extremely satisfying.\u00a0"

After that, I moved into a Band 7 headquarters role, and now I\u2019m in a Band 9 position, leading prison performance improvement nationally. There are plenty of opportunities for progression, and it doesn\u2019t have to be in an operational capacity. I\u2019ve met many OSGs who have moved into administrative or headquarters roles. In fact, some people in my current team started in security or other roles before transitioning into different areas.\u00a0"

            "text": "If this is the work you're looking for, there's a strong likelihood you\u2019ll need to work nights and weekends. Since prisons operate 24/7, shifts need to cover all hours. Flexibility is sometimes possible, especially if the work is covered. I knew people who had football season tickets, so they would swap their shifts to ensure they could attend the football regularly. However, it\u2019s important to be realistic \u2013 don\u2019t sign up expecting complete flexibility.\u00a0"

Your social life tends to revolve around the people you\u2019re working with, and you end up building camaraderie with your colleagues during these unusual hours. It\u2019s a unique environment and you form strong bonds with those around you.\u00a0"

I need someone to open the gate or drive a prisoner to the hospital \u2013 these are all OSG responsibilities. OSGs are the linchpins of the prison, ensuring everything runs smoothly and safely. Direct rehabilitation work, like reducing reoffending or helping prisoners gain an education, can only happen because OSGs enable the processes. We\u2019re the people ensuring the right conditions are there for all that good work to take place.\u00a0"
