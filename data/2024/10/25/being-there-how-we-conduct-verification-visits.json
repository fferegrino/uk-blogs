The shorter calls need to be designed with efficiency in mind and should focus on a narrower range of queries to ensure they are not attended by an unnecessarily large audience and do not begin or end during overly unsocial working hours.\u00a0\u00a0"

These technologies enabled higher quality contact before verification proper and proved helpful to us as we were better able to perform risk assessments and other planning considerations. It also proved helpful for interested parties, as we were able to explain to them what was coming next, share presentations and other infographics and introduce them to key verification terms and procedures, as well as how we would conduct our work. These video sessions replaced what typically would have been performed via telephone or email and were richer as a result.\u00a0\u00a0"
