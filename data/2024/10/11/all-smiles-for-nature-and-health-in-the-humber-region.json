HEY Smile worked with local community groups Solidarity Hull, Welcome House, Hull Afro Caribbean Association, BAMEEN and Bora Shabaa to recruit the Champions. The project builds on and complements the region\u2019s Green Social Prescribing pilot,\u00a0delivered in partnership with HEY Smile and the NHS."

These include feeling unsafe in public parks and a lack of time due to shift work and family commitments. The importance of fostering a sense of belonging, making sure people felt comfortable and included in nature was highlighted. For example, language often used for outdoor activities or sites, such as 'fell walking', 'wetlands', or 'reserve' can be unfamiliar to some communities, so thoughtful communication about outdoor activities can help people feel more comfortable and included."

One exercise used all five senses to help participants deepen their connection to the natural world, enabling them to support their communities to do the same."

Future opportunities for nature connections include the use of citizen science and bringing nature closer to home."
