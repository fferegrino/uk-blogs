        },
        {
            "text": "In recent years, the lake's clear waters have faced a growing threat: harmful blue-green algal blooms. These not only disrupt the delicate ecosystem but also impact the lives of people who depend on the lake for fishing, recreation, and tourism. Addressing this challenge is no small task, but the power of space data and services has the potential to make a real difference."

            "text": "The UK Space Agency\u2019s new challenge, Using Space-Based Technology to Monitor Blue-Green Algal Blooms, aims to do just that. By leveraging the unique capabilities of satellite technology, we can better understand, predict, and manage the spread of harmful algae in Lough Neagh and other waterways. This challenge is not just about solving an immediate environmental issue\u2014it\u2019s about exploring how space technology can provide new insights and tools to help preserve a vital part of Northern Ireland\u2019s natural heritage."

            "text": "Seasonal algal blooms have become a serious concern, driven by excess nutrients from agriculture and wastewater, rising temperatures, and invasive species. In 2023, Lough Neagh experienced severe cyanobacterial growth over the summer, impacting the environment and local communities. Whilst reducing nutrient inputs is a key long-term solution, immediate efforts are needed to better monitor and predict these blooms."

            "text": "Satellite remote sensing can play a critical role in monitoring large and often remote areas, providing regular, consistent data of bloom development and movement that is not always possible through traditional methods."
        },
        {
            "text": "By analysing changes in water colour, temperature, and other indicators, remote sensing can help detect the presence of algal blooms and predict their spread. This is particularly useful in identifying early-stage blooms, allowing authorities to respond more quickly and effectively. Moreover, satellites can provide historical data to help scientists understand past patterns, contributing to a better long-term strategy for managing water quality."
        },
        {
            "text": "The challenge invites innovators to use satellite data, open data sources, AI, and meteorological information to create comprehensive monitoring systems. These solutions could provide a clearer picture of the current state of Lough Neagh\u2019s waters and offer predictions that inform management decisions. The goal is to provide Northern Ireland\u2019s Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) with advanced tools that can make a real difference in how algal blooms are managed."

Running until March 2025, this first phase will focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of proposed solutions."

            "text": "While large algal blooms typically occur in spring and summer, there are opportunities to use real-time and historical satellite data to better understand their dynamics. This approach allows for continuous monitoring throughout the year, and helps establish a baseline for assessing long-term improvements in water quality."

We aim to support sustainable management of ecosystems and resources, contributing valuable insights that can be scaled up to benefit other regions facing similar issues."
