We have been increasing and improving our export support offer on great.gov.uk, so that we can support more businesses by supplementing the in-person support from the department. Great.gov.uk is helping more businesses every year, with a 16% increase in users between 2021 and 2022, and a 30% increase between 2022 and 2023. In Q4 2023/2024, 153k users came to great.gov.uk, out of a total pool of potential exporters to be estimated at around 700k. We\u2019re proud of our growing reach.\u00a0\u00a0"

It is now even easier for users to find export support on great.gov.uk and we have reduced enquiries for routine information like finding your EORI number. However, a research report showed that while our triage system has made it easier to answer simple questions, it is sometimes still hard to locate answers to complex questions. This can be a frustrating experience, and those experiencing this can\u2019t take the next step in their exporting journey. My team was tasked with building the next iteration of our export support triaging system and overcoming this challenge.\u00a0"

As the team who manages online export enquiries, they have a great understanding of the problems that exporters face. Together, we produced a list of 120 export tasks which contains the activities that an exporter could be doing to export their product or service. An example of a task would be \u2018get your commodity code\u2019. The tasks were grouped into 8 categories, each containing multiple subcategories. As an example, the \u2018get your commodity code\u2019 task sits within the \u2018how to make a customs declaration\u2019 sub-category of the \u2018customs, taxes and declarations\u2019 category.\u00a0\u00a0"

The digital team will continue to work with EDES and stakeholders through a monthly advisory group to maintain this collaboration between online and offline export support teams.\u00a0"

We will ask what the user is exporting, where they are exporting to, and the task they want to resolve. We ask the questions progressively rather than all at once, and after each user input we surface relevant and specific information based on the input. As the user gives us more information we can refine what is returned until we give the user what they are looking for. This will allow users to self-serve quicker and easier as the information shown is tailored to their specific circumstances, and irrelevant information is hidden.\u00a0"

The live experiment put a very stripped-back version of the guided journey onto the great.gov.uk homepage. We asked users what product or service they were intending to export and which market they had in mind. As the user provided each input, we presented a very limited selection of results through the journey. We managed to develop this live experiment in just two weeks. In just a month we saw that 97% of users who completed the journey had a product and 70% had a market. We also saw a 60% increase in sign-ups from the homepage banner while the experiment was live. This gave us an indication that a journey that appears tailored to the user could lead to greater engagement and drive sign-ups to the site. This in turn gives us greater insight into businesses looking to export, and, if they consent, the opportunity to contact them proactively to support their exporting journey.\u00a0\u00a0"
