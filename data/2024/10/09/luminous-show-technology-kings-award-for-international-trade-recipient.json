            "text": "LUMINOUS applied to the category for International Trade because it represents our unique relationships with the entertainment industry worldwide. It also outlines our substantial growth in the face of many challenges. Just a few years prior, in response to COVID-19, we transformed the business into manufacturing PPE as the live events industry stood still. We quickly bounced back to doing what we do best and have exceeded expectations. We have provided equipment for events all around the world, such as Disney\u2019s touring productions, the Commowealth Games in Birmingham, Terhal by Dragone in Saudi Arabia, and Harry Potter & The Cursed Child theatre shows across the USA, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Australia."

However, the period of waiting for a decision was undeniably nerve-wracking. Given the significance of the award, we were eager to hear the outcome and anxious to know if our efforts had been recognised. Despite the anxiety of waiting, the process itself was efficient and allowed us to effectively showcase our accomplishments."
