        {
            "text": "Therefore, it\u2019s important to find a way to pay the insured quicker, which parametric insurance aims to do. Parametric insurance pays the policyholder a fixed amount when a pre-defined directly measurable event happens at a certain intensity and location. "

        {
            "text": "As an example, a hurricane parametric product could trigger a payout if wind speed exceeds a pre-specified threshold. Payment would be made immediately upon the wind speeds passing the threshold, allowing finance to be accessed quicker for those whose lives have been impacted."

            "text": "If the payment amount is set too low based on the trigger event, then the payouts may not be enough to protect the livelihoods of the insured. Conversely, if the payments are set too high, it may make the insurance prohibitively expensive. "
        },
        {
            "text": "Similarly, setting the trigger events may be difficult. If the threshold is set too severely, then those insured may not receive any financial assistance until it is too late or none at all following an extreme weather event. "

            "text": "The thresholds are based on satellite data which often doesn\u2019t reach far back enough to give an understanding on what threshold would correspond to a 1 in 10 year event, the level that nations will often want to insure at. "

            "text": "However, care needs to be taken when setting the payout thresholds as it may not provide appropriate levels of cover.

In recent years, significant investment has been made in technology to increase timeliness and access to information, which improves the financial products that can be offered to cover flood risk. "
