The project has already brought its Windrush themed ballet show, Island Movements, to 25 libraries in England and Northern Ireland, with a further 15 shows taking place this month."

The exhibition aims to celebrate the unique experiences, contributions, and achievements of Black ballet dancers who have historically faced barriers and discrimination within the industry. As a result of this funding, English National Ballet also asked to host the exhibition which will run at their HQ in Canning Town until the end of November. A Royal Ballet centred version of the exhibition is also currently at The Royal Ballet and Opera House."

            "text": "Oxygen Arts is a tiny social enterprise, created to share diverse stories. Alone, we could not have had a fraction of the impact that working with public libraries has brought to the project. Library spaces extend across the country, their staff understand the importance of telling these types of stories and immediately grasp the impact on their communities that these could have. They value the arts as an end in itself, and their local knowledge and ability to attract audiences for all types of activities are essential for a small organisation like ours with such limited resources."
