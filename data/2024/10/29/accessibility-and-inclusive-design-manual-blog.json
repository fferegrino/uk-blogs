But there were things we saw happening across projects that made us want to explore this space, to see if we, as the DesignOps team, could further support service teams with accessibility and inclusive design practices."

We strive to ensure that everyone has access to services, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. Accessibility and inclusivity aren\u2019t just about meeting legal requirements - they\u2019re about ensuring our services reflect the diversity of our users and are genuinely usable by everyone."

Our goal was to uncover areas where improvements could be made and identify where gaps in knowledge or practice existed. Through this research, we discovered that while teams were aware of accessibility requirements, many had limited experience with essential activities like commissioning accessibility audits, conducting internal testing, and writing accurate accessibility statements."

It also presented a clear design challenge: how could we help teams deepen their understanding and awareness of accessibility, and how could we create a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to accessibility and inclusive design in the service delivery lifecycle?"

So alongside tool-specific guidance, we\u2019re also creating a selection of short training videos to demonstrate how to use testing tools on some of our digital products.As always, we\u2019re committed to working in the open. You can follow our progress in developing the manual through our accessibility and inclusive design design histories and make use of any of our work from our public GitHub repository. We welcome feedback, and if you would like to discuss the project further or provide input, you can contact the DfE DesignOps team."
