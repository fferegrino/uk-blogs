Biodiversity is vital for mental and physical health. It cleans the air, prevents floods, and cools the environment. We need to avoid building on these green spaces where possible and work to preserve them. In recent years, we found rare orchids and endangered invertebrates on our UK healthcare sites. They show the value of a small oasis in our urban spaces.\u202fThese green spaces play a vital role in SUDs (sustainable urban drainage). They aid climate adaptation and boost health and well-being. We must, therefore, preserve biodiversity where we can and increase species in those areas.\u00a0"

BNG ensures that if a habitat is lost to development, it must be recreated either on-site or if not feasible, nearby, with associated costs. The BNG assessment should be carried out by a qualified ecologist and quantified according to the Statutory Biodiversity Metric. It needs to be beneficial to the environment, multiplied by the value of the lost space and protected for 30 years.\u202f This new space must be protected.\u202f We can develop awareness among staff, estate teams, contractors and the public on the importance of biodiversity and its role in our health system.\u00a0 We also need the ecological and environmental skills to protect and maintain it.\u00a0"

Applying BNG principles to hospital design can create healing environments supporting human health and the ecosystem. As large institutions, hospitals often involve significant construction, which can disrupt local ecosystems. However, integrating BNG into these projects can mitigate the environmental impact and enhance patient care.\u00a0\u00a0"

They demonstrate our commitment to responsible development. These elements support local flora and fauna.\u00a0 They also provide patients and staff access to nature, which has been proven to reduce stress, improve mood, and even accelerate healing. Designing hospitals with BNG in mind goes beyond aesthetics. This could include planting pollinator-friendly gardens to support bees, creating wetlands that manage stormwater, or incorporating natural light and views of greenery into the hospital's design.\u00a0\u00a0"

By integrating nature into hospital design, we can develop spaces that heal both people and the planet, fostering a sustainable future for healthcare.\u00a0"

It is better to look at the entire site or estate and create a BNG strategy that allows mitigation efforts to be delivered over a wider area. Due to the specialised nature of BNG evaluation and planning, it is likely that external expertise will be needed to develop a robust plan and provide ongoing support.\u00a0"

            "text": "Another key finding was that Trust stakeholders had not yet accounted for BNG-related costs in their future development plans. BNG should be assessed early, with appropriate budgets allocated within developments.\u00a0 Alternatively, they can be mitigated through actions defined in a BNG strategy. Evaluating BNG requirements at an early stage of development can help ensure that valuable natural assets are incorporated into the plans. This can avoid loss of biodiversity and the associated liabilities.\u00a0"

            "text": "The training highlighted the financial and reputational risks trusts face if they reduce biodiversity value of land, before development.\u00a0 This applies whether it is done intentionally or not and applies even to areas that may not appear valuable to project planners. As a result, early training for stakeholders is crucial. This training initiative has helped Dorset NHS Partners take a proactive step towards meeting BNG requirements and ensuring that biodiversity remains a priority in their future developments.\u00a0"
