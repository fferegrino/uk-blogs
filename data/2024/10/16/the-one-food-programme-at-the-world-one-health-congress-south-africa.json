The Congress took place over four days in the Cape Town International Conference Centre and focussed on how the One Health concept can help tackle the world\u2019s pressing challenges of food safety and security, environmental pollution, human health, climate change, antimicrobial resistance and zoonotic disease. The event provided the opportunity to look at global One Health science and policy from the perspectives of African colleagues."

The session, with over 100 attendees, explored the challenges and opportunities for a One Health approach to food systems. The panel, comprising representatives of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), United \u00a0Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), World Bank and the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), discussed key questions on integrating across the three One Health pillars for food systems transformation, embedding the One Food approach into \u2018business as usual\u2019 and what a healthy food system could look like in the future."

The One Food programme is looking to place hazard control [e.g., diseases, contaminants etc) at the centre of this new approach \u2013 reducing production losses, avoiding waste in the supply chain, making food safer to eat and ultimately, reducing the footprint of the food system to realise One Health benefits. The quadripartite [FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH] are already looking at this kind of systems approach via their Joint Plan of Action \u2013 programmes such as One Food developing the methods and approaches needed to make this collaborative approach a working reality.\u201d"

This interactive space created an opportunity for deeper dialogue between the experts present at WOHC and to advocate for shared learning to improve our ability to work together and optimise One Health outcomes. There were visitors from government, academic and research institutions and international visitors who were interested in One Food. All were encouraged to join the One Food Community of Practice, which brings previously disparate deep specialisms together around a shared belief \u2013 better, safer foods that have less impact on the environment. The community co-develops science, policy and societal solutions to the pressing challenge of sufficient, accessible, appropriate, safe, resilient and environmentally positive food for all."

It\u2019s really challenging to work across diverse disciplines because we speak different technical languages and hold different worldviews; one person\u2019s ecosystem to conserve is another\u2019s natural resource to utilise. The One Health approach gives us a banner under which we can frame our common goals, and the World One Health Congress is the place to have those cross-pollinating conversations.\u201d"

One of the central outputs of the programme is the \u2018One Food Risk Tool\u2019, a whole-food system risk assessment tool, developed on the template of the earlier Seafood Risk Tool, which seeks to estimate the impact of all hazards (i.e. problems) acting on, or created by, food systems. The tool assesses the impact of chemical, biological, physical and societal along different stages of the food value chain across all food sectors; allowing the relative risk of the hazards to be compared and in doing so facilitating collective decisions on priority interventions."
