These two services work together to provide a seamless user experience.The web chat has evolved as the programme has grown and the agents are now able to manage multiple chats with users. The chatbot has also increased the number of tasks it can handle at any one time. This enables users to quickly resolve straightforward\u00a0issues through a chatbot, meaning our agents are able to dedicate their time to more complex issues."
