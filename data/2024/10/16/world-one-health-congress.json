The Congress took place over four days in the Cape Town International Conference Centre and focussed on how the One Health concept can help tackle the world\u2019s pressing challenges of food safety and security, environmental pollution, human health, climate change, antimicrobial resistance and zoonotic disease. The event provided the opportunity to look at global One Health science and policy from the perspectives of African colleagues."

At the project\u2019s core are integrated One Health principles, which seek to balance and optimise the health of humans, animals/plants and ecosystems, known as the three (One Health \u2018pillars\u2019)."

The session, with over 100 attendees, explored the challenges and opportunities for a One Health approach to food systems. The panel, comprising representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), The\u202fUnited Nations Environment Programme\u202f(UNEP), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), World Bank and South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), discussed key questions on integrating across the three One Health pillars for food systems transformation, embedding the One Food approach into \u2018business as usual\u2019 and what a healthy food system could look like in the future."

This interactive space created an opportunity for deeper dialogue between the experts present at WOHC and to advocate for shared learning to improve our ability to work together and optimise One Health outcomes. There were visitors from government, academic and research institutions and international visitors who were interested in One Food. All were encouraged to join the One Food Community of Practice, which brings previously disparate deep specialisms together around a shared belief \u2013 better, safer foods that have less impact on the environment. The community co-develops science, policy and societal solutions to the pressing challenge of sufficient, accessible, appropriate, safe, resilient and environmentally positive food for all."

One of the central outputs of the programme is the \u2018One Food Risk Tool\u2019, a whole-food system risk assessment tool, developed on the template of the earlier Seafood Risk Tool, which seeks to estimate the impact of all hazards (i.e. problems) acting on, or created by, food systems. The tool assesses the impact of chemical, biological, physical and societal along different stages of the food value chain across all food sectors; allowing the relative risk of the hazards to be compared and in doing so facilitating collective decisions on priority interventions."
