In this follow up video, we go behind the scenes to look at the agronomics that support the improvements Tom made and why regulation can help a farm business. The video features Rob, our Senior Environment Officer in Cornwall, and Graham, a local agronomist who worked with Tom. (And also happens to be his father-in-law!)"

            "text": "If we look beyond this, regulation also provides other things. Like all sectors, agriculture is competitive and businesses that are efficient will thrive. Clear regulations that are properly enforced mean that all businesses compete on\u00a0 a level playing field. They all have to achieve the same regulatory compliance, and have to invest similar amounts of time and money, relatively speaking, in doing so."

        {
            "text": "If you have more capacity to store organic fertilisers from your livestock (i.e. slurry), then you only have to use it when you need to. In practice what this means is applying it to your land when the conditions are most favourable, when the grass or crops you are growing need it and when they will benefit most from it. And it is possible to quantify this - Graham notes that nutrient uptake when applying slurry in Spring, as opposed to Autumn, can be as much as 30% more due to more favourable conditions. Not only that, by doing so you will be complying with Farming Rules for Water requirements to only spread fertiliser to land in accordance with soil and crop need."

        {
            "text": "The knock-on effect of this is clear \u2013 less need to buy in bagged fertiliser, with significant savings year on year. Add in reduced costs for fuel and vehicle maintenance, fewer man hours and reduced impact on soils from heavy machinery and the benefits start to add up. Also, by increasing his storage capacity, Tom was able to create an efficient \u2018circular economy\u2019 on his farm. Nutrients being applied to land from slurry, growing more grass to feed his cows, nutrients then returned to the land through the slurry."
