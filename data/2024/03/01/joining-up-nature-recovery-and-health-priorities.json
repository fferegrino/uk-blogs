Conversely, it also highlights evidence for the negative impacts of contaminated and degraded nature on human health and well-being, and outlines where more research is needed. This includes showing how nature improvement activity impacts those living nearby."

Green social prescribing is embedded within the NHS long term plan, and accessible greenspace is highlighted as a determinant of health in the Department for Health and Social Care\u2019s 'Major Conditions Strategy\u2019. The Department for Education\u2019s \u2018Sustainability and Climate Change Strategy\u2019 (2022) draws on learning in the natural environment for physical and mental health, and the Government\u2019s Levelling up Missions note the importance of access to natural spaces. These are all important steps forward."
