I have been stationed in the Falklands since August, and my responsibilities include coordinating movements around the entire island and facilitating transport, whether it be for military personnel or civilian contractors, to manage vehicle serviceability. I work alongside the operational team to ensure everything runs smoothly with regards to equipment. One significant aspect is managing personnel, both at the mountain sites of Mt Alice and Byron Heights, and Mount Pleasant Complex (MPC)."

We have a morning brief to align on movements, flights, and incoming personnel to the island. From this we\u2019ll have a set of actions, which could be anything from coordinating engineers to supporting the delivery of a resupply ship. No two days are ever alike! The pace is relentless, but it keeps me engaged and passionate about my contribution to the safety of the Falkland Islands."

I have always enjoyed problem solving, and looking for solutions, and often there are tasks that are time critical. It\u2019s satisfying knowing that as an office we have managed to fix something quickly and efficiently!"

The base itself has facilities like a pool, cinema, gaming lounge, and bowling alley, providing great entertainment within the complex. It is challenging for personnel being 8,000 miles away from family and friends, so keeping in touch always boosts morale. Apart from the historical value and military presence, the Falklands offer breath-taking wildlife experiences, from penguins to killer whales. I must admit, I did see \u2018too much, too fast\u2019 when I first arrived. Within just 6 weeks, I\u2019d managed to see all the key tourist attractions!"

It\u2019s very easy to fall into the negative mindset of \u2018I\u2019m far from home, it\u2019s going to be difficult\u201d. In all honesty, it has been a completely different experience for me. Whilst being away from family and friends has provided its own challenge, the Adjutant role provides a unique insight into decision-making processes and offers a fast-paced, enriching environment that has made my tour feel productive knowing I have contributed to the wider Air Force. I would even go as far to say that if anyone was due to come to the Falkland Islands, that Strategic Command would be a role I would recommend!"
