Yet that is the reality for some young people in the Civil Service. Nearly 4000 civil servants under the age of 30 are carers."

They may experience barriers to accessing and fully participating in education and training because of their caring roles and this can translate into barriers to employment.\u00a0We are keen to break down these barriers which is why we have included young carers in our Going Forward into Employment (GFiE) programme."

It is available across the civil service, year-round and nationwide.\u00a0 It opens up opportunities in the civil service directly to carers, offering 12-24 month fixed term appointments with the potential for permanency in some cases. Alongside the job, the scheme offers support to candidates and their line managers."
