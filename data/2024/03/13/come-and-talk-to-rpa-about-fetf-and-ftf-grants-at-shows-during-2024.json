There was a wide range of farmers attending, from small holdings to large farming businesses. Mostly farmers and external stakeholders came with questions on funding and also queries about their current applications in RPA payment schemes. We also had leaflets and cards to hand out which were of great use to signpost farmers to various gov.uk sites.\u201d"
