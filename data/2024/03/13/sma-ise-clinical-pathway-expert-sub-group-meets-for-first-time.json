            "text": "The group\u2019s terms of reference, which focus on the clinical pathway for newborn screening for SMA, were agreed. Although the group will not specifically address the laboratory pathway, its work will align closely with that of the laboratory group and some members will sit on both groups."

            "text": "Dr Elliman presented a draft clinical pathway flowchart for SMA newborn screening which was the focus for this meeting. The UK SMA Newborn Screening Alliance kindly offered to share its existing screening and treatment clinical pathway documents to support further discussions and resource development."

            "text": "The meeting then received an insight into the national SMA newborn screening programmes of Sweden and the Netherlands with each country outlining a different screening pathway for the reporting of SMN1 deletion and SMN2 copy numbers, and the subsequent referral pathways. The different pathways reflect the available treatment options for asymptomatic individuals in Sweden and the Netherlands."
