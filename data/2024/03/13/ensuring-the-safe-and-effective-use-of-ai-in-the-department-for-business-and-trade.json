            "text": "As humans, the process of getting our thoughts down \u2018on paper\u2019 is neurologically hugely complex. Indeed, it is not possible to build a model that accurately represents how we do this. So instead, current language models are built by training statistical models on trillions of words taken from the world wide web. To represent the richness of language, the resulting models are some of the most complex ever developed, containing billions of parameters. For comparison, models used to process images typically have millions rather than billions of parameters.\u00a0\u00a0"

Huge numbers of computers are therefore pooled together so that the training can be done in a reasonable amount of time. Consequently, only those organisations with access to such resources are currently able to develop these models. This means that the most popular models tend to be developed by \u2018big tech\u2019 companies, although some smaller start-ups and academic collaborations have also developed models.\u00a0"

We opted for a voluntary review by the Government Internal Audit Agency to determine the robustness of DBT\u2019s AI adoption strategy.

They tailored their well-established Process Based Governance framework to show how it applied to DBT.
