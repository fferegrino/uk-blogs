During our Changing Futures work, Policy Lab worked with around 10 people with lived experience from the NECG. They joined co-design workshops and met regularly with Policy Lab to shape the ethnography and systems change work we did. This process meant our understanding of the current system, and our ideas for change, were rooted in real life experiences and needs. Over 9 months, we invited the group \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 to help us shape our sessions and project thinking, rather than only interacting through workshops.\u00a0\u00a0"

In project evaluations, many policymakers cited the importance of including people with lived experience in the room, and how this shifted their understanding of the problems and possible solutions. One Changing Futures policymaker reflects, \"I particularly appreciated the sense of contributions in the room... It feels like this should be the business-as-usual policy development process.\" As individuals, we felt a deeper empathy, connection and a powerful motivation, for the challenges that we worked on together. The approach, including being involved in decision-making, was also valued by those with lived experience."
