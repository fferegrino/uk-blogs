The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are driving innovation, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs across the UK."

What \u201cmodern\u201d means changes all the time; I remember when using email seemed like an incredibly modern system. To me, I think building a modern civil service is really about building a civil service that can adapt to what's going to be an ever-present and probably ever-increasing pace of change. We need the skills, the tools, the permission to adapt and grow and change to meet all of the challenges that the world continues to throw at us.\u00a0"

            "text": "Changing and adapting, but also really respecting the things that are in our civil service heritage and our history that make us. I think our values are ever constant, and our mission is ever constant. So all of us need those constants to really grip onto. And I think one of the wonderful things about the civil service is it actually offers us that kind of foundation of the values that we live by and the mission that we hold to, regardless of the innovations we pursue."

            "text": "I think it's really important to start by saying that I think we already have amazing innovation in the civil service and that's innovation of all different kinds. We've done incredible things at a really remarkable pace. In my time in the civil service, I've seen us introduce things like the furlough scheme during COVID, brand new energy price support schemes, and completely new legal frameworks after leaving the EU. Or, looking right across HMG, the work on a single login for gov.uk, or the work Natural England have done to restore peatlands by identifying drainage channels for maintenance.\u00a0"

            "text": "I think there's a huge amount to build on, but it's definitely inconsistent. Sometimes, when we have a crisis to get innovation going, we don't always manage to make that way of working, or perhaps the calmer version of that way of working, part of our everyday life right across our operation."

        {
            "text": "So there's something about taking some of that brilliance and making sure we can do it more consistently.\u00a0 And then the other thing that for me would really show that we had become a truly innovative organisation is I don't think we're as good as we should be at scaling up new ideas."

        {
            "text": "We're a really big organisation. We are jam-packed with talent and with brilliant thoughts about how things could be improved and made better; but we don't always capture those ideas and turn them into delivery. Even when we do that, perhaps in one department or in one team, we're not always good at spotting that it has happened and then scaling it up to the bigger organisation and then to the civil service as a whole.\u00a0"

        },
        {
            "text": "But to my mind, when we think about the skills that we need to build across the civil service, I wouldn't put quite so much emphasis on helping with getting people to have ideas. For me, it's about building the skills that help us scale up those ideas and deliver them. So it's a set of skills about change management and implementation so that we can take a good idea and turn it into a real change in our overall system. And it's also about skills in how we monitor and evaluate."

        {
            "text": "When you've got lots of good ideas, the real question is: which ideas made the biggest difference? Which ones should we really invest in and push forward because they've made a big change happen? We can only do that If we're able to understand and measure the change that we're seeing. So for me, it would be helping us with implementation and change management skills that we need to be brilliant at in the civil service."

There's something particular for leaders about how you create permission and safety to innovate and build a culture around innovation. If there is one thing that I try to ask myself and my teams to do, it's to look at the environment you create around taking risks."

            "text": "Most really successful entrepreneurs have had at least one failed business in their past. I think our leaders have a huge role to play in creating a culture where we can be honest about failures and examine those failures, but with a spirit of learning and developing the idea and seeing what we can do next time, rather than with a spirit of blame or criticism."

            "text": "I think it is difficult sometimes in the civil service to create an environment that fosters risk taking because the truth is we do a lot of things that really matter. And of course, there are many aspects of our work where taking risk is absolutely not the right answer. Our tolerance for risk isn't that high because we're providing services that really matter to the general public. But we can (and arguable must) create environments where we can experiment, sometimes you need to create a sandbox so that you can do a bit of innovation and learn from it."

That's not an easy trick to pull off, but I think that's what the public is asking of us as public servants."

It's definitely not unique to the Civil Service and it's especially true in complex organisations. We have to be able to handle many different kinds of issues and bring together solutions to really challenging problems. Trying to make big, complex systems change just isn't always very easy, and I don't think we should beat ourselves up about it. There's lots of potential for us to collectively do better."
