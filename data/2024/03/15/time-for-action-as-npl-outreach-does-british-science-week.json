As a public sector research establishment, NPL delivers extraordinary impact by providing the measurement capability that underpins the UK's prosperity and quality of life."

            "text": "Since 2015, each year on average, an audience of over comprising students of all ages, from primary school to postdocs, their educators, and the general public, have met with people at NPL and learnt about science, technology, engineering and maths. British Science Week is a particularly busy time for engagement, with at least 40 activities linked to the 10-day nationwide campaign."

            "text": "The theme of British Science Week this year is \u2018Time\u2019, so NPL is exploding with excitement as we are the UK home of timekeeping. We know that many people still think that time comes from Greenwich, so we work closely with the Royal Museum Greenwich to help inform the public about the different links and roles both organisations play in relation to timekeeping in the UK. In one particular initiative, we put one of our clocks on a boat and sent it down the Thames to Greenwich!"

            "text": "So, how can we use the theme of \u2018Time\u2019 to help deliver on our primary goal of inspiring the next generation to consider STEM as a career? During our workshops, we run experiments around time involving pendulums, and we have also used metal strips to find resonant frequencies. We experimentally test reaction times (utilising many hundreds of children) with the hypothesis that dominant hands have a faster reaction time than non-dominant hands."

Please find details here if you would like to encourage your local school to participate.\u00a0Such primary-school online events have previously drawn in audiences of around 20,000 participants."

They are delighted that NPL takes outreach so seriously and are thrilled that our diverse workforce can enable role models different to those most members of the public expect scientists/engineers to look like, helping us effectively work with the Social Mobility Forum, The Blackett Lab Family, Young Enterprise, STEM Ambassadors Programme, The STEM Hub and In2Science, to name a few of our many collaborators."
