I have always been able to hit the ground running, also thanks to my dedication to self-study, personal development and the valuable training I have benefitted from in digital government. I have progressed to become a subject matter expert in my field."

            "text": "To women aspiring to work in similar roles, I cannot stress enough the importance of finding a mentor. Having someone independent to bounce ideas off of has been invaluable to me. Shadowing someone who is already doing the job is also a great way to gain insight and experience. Additionally, it is crucial to engage with and learn from other women working in technology across the department. A starting point for this can be through joining our technology community of practice.\u00a0"

            "text": "One of the recent initiatives I led to inspire inclusion in digital was a series of workshops in partnership with Beyond Equality to raise awareness on practical actions teams and individuals can take to make inclusion a reality in the workplace. Central to these sessions was the question: 'What influence could I have to remove some of the barriers to other people's inclusion?'.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "Another similar initiative centred on psychological safety in our teams \u2013 the shared belief that it's ok to take risks, speak up or make mistakes without fear of retaliation, thus creating a more inclusive environment and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement in digital. We continue to include these elements in our digital and agile learning offering."

            "text": "Unfortunately, unconscious bias can still manifest in various ways. But instead of pointing fingers, I believe in finding ways to help people recognise their bias and understand what they\u2019re doing. Most of us do not have ill intentions \u2013 we simply need guidance. Throughout my Civil Service career, I often wondered why there were not more senior leaders who looked and sounded like me. However, thanks to my leader, I no longer feel different or isolated. Her inclusive leadership style has made a significant impact, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment in our teams."

As a single mum to 2 primary school children, work life balance is particularly important to me, and it\u2019s great to feel that my parental responsibilities are understood and accommodated by the caring and compassionate leadership of my employer."

I think this is getting more recognition from employers generally, but this requires additional flexibility and support to be available and preventative measures to be in place where needed to ensure that employee wellbeing is maintained where there might be conflicts between work and personal priorities.\u00a0"

There are a number of support groups available for staff, including a gender equality network, which are all really diverse and active. I am a member of the Working Parents Network and, as well as providing a sense of community and support, being part of this network helps me to feel that my needs are being represented in wider conversations about policy changes within the department.\u00a0"

            "text": "I\u2019d encourage any woman aspiring to work in digital to approach women who inspire them to ask for the opportunity to talk about their career journeys, seek out opportunities to shadow and observe, and take part in coaching or mentorship, where offered to you. Never be intimidated by a successful, empowered, inspiring female leader or colleague. They have so much to offer in terms of experience, advice and wisdom, and your approach will probably give them a confidence boost too.\u00a0 In my experience, women very rarely realise quite how amazing they are."

            "text": "But crucially, inspiring inclusion starts early. Waiting until university is too late to encourage women to pursue careers in technology. We should go to schools, inspiring kids to consider digital careers. Whether it's becoming a software engineer, a delivery manager or a product specialist, we need to emphasise the importance of STEM subjects and show that anyone can be involved in creating and programming, regardless of their gender.\u00a0"
