Overwhelmingly, the panel was about supporting and inspiring women to be authentic leaders, take the opportunity (even when you don\u2019t tick every single criterion) and to lead with empathy and compassion.\u00a0\u00a0"

Not only do you get a chance to develop valuable and useful skills you might not get through your day-to-day work (e.g. volunteering to help organise a huge event like the GSE Conference), you also get to meet and mix with people from a range of different departments which certainly adds to a feeling of us all being part of a wider Civil Service science and engineering team.\u00a0"
