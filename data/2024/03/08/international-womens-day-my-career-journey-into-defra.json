There wasn\u2019t a lot of money while I was growing up, so getting out to work to earn my own money was important to me."

I had a white board opposite my desk with post-it notes to show the priorities \u2013 the visual aspect of the post-it notes worked best with the engineers who I was having to direct. I wasn\u2019t given any training to deal with it that way, I was working on instinct."
