The clay slurry is then transported in pipelines to the clay refiners and driers where the finished clay product is produced. The complex operational and pipeline infrastructure that Imerys operates allows it to recycle a significant amount of its water (estimated at 40%) thereby reducing its environmental impact.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
