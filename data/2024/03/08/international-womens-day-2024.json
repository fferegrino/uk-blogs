I lead on our GSE newsletter which is for our members to keep up to date with courses, events, opportunities and much more happening within GSE and across-government. I also help with planning and executing events. Currently we are planning our presence for Civil Service Live and our biannual GSE Conference taking place in September 2024. I also work on projects for the team when this is required such as to help create a framework of allowances for scientist and engineers across government.\u00a0"

I am really pleased with the range of events we have coming up internally and externally. To find out more, check out the GSE special edition newsletter.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "When I graduated, I knew I wanted to carry on being involved with science as that\u2019s what I enjoyed the most. I decided to join the government as I wanted to contribute to making a difference, whether that was through policies, courses for scientists, etc but overall wanted to be a part of promoting science. I think the government is the perfect place to be innovative, creative and involved in projects that make a real difference to our society. Overall, while pharmacology remains a field of interest to me, joining the government aligns with my desire to make a meaningful difference at a broader societal level and utilises my skills in communication and stakeholder engagement.\u00a0"

Drawing insights from a range of data sheets and comparing them, is something I did a lot during university and constantly had to support my ideas with evidence. Working in comms means being quick on your feet and also being a part of a fast- paced environment, and as a scientist, I constantly had multiple ongoing projects that needed attention. This experience has helped me keep organised, keep calm under pressure and deal with deadlines swiftly.\u00a0"

I enjoy working in events as I get to collaborate with a range of people, and it\u2019s always satisfying seeing people sign up and enjoy the events. I also enjoy the fact that this role is very creative, which is something I haven\u2019t done previously as a scientist. It has allowed me to push out of my comfort zone and become much more confident in myself, while also learning new skills such as writing scripts and collaborating with new people which I am sure will be beneficial in the future.\u00a0"
