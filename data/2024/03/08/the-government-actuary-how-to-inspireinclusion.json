            "text": "For me inclusion is about everyone having access to the same opportunities to develop their career. However, we know that opportunities aren\u2019t always freely available. If they were, you\u2019d see there was a good balance by gender and race at all levels and throughout society. So, we need to take conscious actions to overcome what could be either implicit or explicit barriers blocking people from getting equal access to opportunities."

            "text": "I\u2019ve always felt lucky that I haven\u2019t had significant challenges at work, but it\u2019s probably partly a conscious career choice as well. When you work in a consulting environment, like GAD, we know we do better for our clients when we work as a team, and we reward more collegiate behaviour. This positive element of culture allows people to contribute more easily and progress."

        {
            "text": "However, even now there are still times when I go to a meeting and feel in the minority and that can be intimidating, especially at the earlier stages of your career. I found that by being authentic and bringing out your personality as well as your technical skills, meant it wasn\u2019t as difficult an environment in practice. Remember there may well be other people in a meeting who are possibly intimidated by the environment for other reasons, maybe even by you being an actuary!"

I don\u2019t want people to be sitting with great ideas in GAD, and for them to feel inhibited about speaking up or challenging how we are doing things. That\u2019s an important benefit of creating an open culture and inclusion."

It means that by their early- to mid-40s, men and women should have had the same amount of time out of the workforce. That will help in getting gender pay and leadership equality, provided employers follow through in supporting men to use their leave."

            "text": "It was also an example of the importance of building your network. \u00a0It\u2019s a two-way thing that you give and get from throughout your career. There's lots of data about how women only put themselves forward for a role when they think they've got 100% of things required, so a network that challenges you to see yourself differently is helpful."
