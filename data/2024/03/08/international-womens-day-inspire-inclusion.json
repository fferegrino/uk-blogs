            "text": "Trust, representation, opportunity, understanding, belonging. These are just a few of the many words that come to mind when I think about what diversity and inclusion mean to me. Today is International Women\u2019s Day, which aims to \u2018Inspire Inclusion\u2019 for women in all aspects of life. But I believe this sentiment should be carried beyond today and beyond gender alone."

            "text": "We\u2019re all individuals with our own unique differences, be that race, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, socio-economic background, physical and cognitive ability. However, there\u2019s a richness in creating a diverse and inclusive environment that nurtures a sense of belonging and understanding to get the best out of every individual for themselves and for society."

            "text": "When individuals feel the security, safety and trust in the environment they\u2019re working in, they can bring their whole selves to work. This can inspire confidence in putting their ideas or points across, knowing they\u2019ll be heard, valued and have an equal voice."

            "text": "Having diverse perspectives helps generate new ideas, awareness of bias or areas requiring further review, helping us develop effective solutions. It helps allow the bigger picture thinking which is vital in the work that we do to serve the public and society at the MHRA. We must support and inspire the journeys of people from diverse backgrounds so we can continue to create a rich environment in our industry."

I thought the only route was to become a doctor as culturally that was a respected and stable job. However, I soon realised that it wasn\u2019t the medicine, but the science that excited me the most, and this took me to an MSc in Toxicology, where I was inspired by the drug development process."

            "text": "When I finished university, I knew I wanted to work as a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) in the pharmaceutical industry, but this is where I met my first hurdle, I had no idea how to go about it. I had no role models in industry, I didn\u2019t know anyone who could help, so I did my own research into the qualifications needed and self-funded my ICH-GCP course."

            "text": "I then encountered a few recruiters who gaslighted me and made me feel that I stood no chance in getting a role out of university as a CRA. But I knew this was what I wanted, and thankfully, one great recruiter contacted me about an entry level CRA role where a candidate had dropped out last minute and I got the job!"

I\u2019ve kept the drive I had as a child, it\u2019s this drive that makes me stay in this industry, as any one of us and our loved ones can become ill, and we\u2019ll all need medicine in our life. I want to make sure that there are safe, effective treatments available for all."

We\u2019re also involved in policy and guidance development and have a key role in maintaining public trust in taking medicine."

            "text": "Just as diversity and inclusion are needed in the workplace and society, it\u2019s vital for our clinical trials if we\u2019re going to inspire trust in the populations who are going to take these medicines. We\u2019ve seen changes in trial design and recruitment practices to reach underserved populations, but there\u2019s still work to do to build that trust."

Whilst there\u2019s work to do, I\u2019m proud of the support offered by the Compliance Teams who continually work to define and improve our culture as teams of inspectors."

            "text": "I recently participated in the Race in STEM Roundtable where we discussed the need to ensure that our efforts result in change. To support this, education is important and being open to learning as well as being aware of our own unconscious biases. We also discussed the importance of role models and if you can see it, you can be it, which was certainly true in my case when I joined as an inspector. Finally, we have some work to do in having sponsors in the workplace who can champion individuals within their career within the agency and provide guidance and support."
