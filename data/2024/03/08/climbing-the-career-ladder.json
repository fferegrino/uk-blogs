You learn fast about the dos and don\u2019ts of being a manager and I can honestly say that now, after over 25 years of managing teams in various roles and levels, it is one aspect of my job I enjoy most."

My confidence was knocked as I had been effectively doing the job but one the best pieces of advice I had and can now give, is ask for and act on feedback. I was able to put this into practice and next time the opportunity came I applied again and got the job."

I was an operations manager in a Customer Service Contact Centre where I led teams of up to 100 colleagues. It was a fast-paced working environment which helped to develop my performance and management skills further. I really enjoyed this role and was able to work towards a leadership and management qualification within the Operational Delivery Profession."

There I learned a new approach in developing people and in particularly managers as I worked to create and deliver management programmes across the UK. I found that I had a natural ability in this area and thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the role. When a permanent post came up in the team, I jumped at it and in total spent 5 years learning my Learning & Development (L&D) trade which included completing a level 5 CIPD HR qualification and delivering several capability projects and initiatives across HMRC\u2019s Customer Services Group and securing another promotion."

I can honestly say that I love my job, it\u2019s the best of both worlds for me in that I\u2019m using my talents, skills, experience and learning to build capability and develop colleagues to manage and deliver customer service excellence for HMRC. I\u2019ve also gained another qualification as an accredited coach to support my new role, making the most of our departments learning offer."

My career journey has also been mainly experiential but learning and qualifications have played a big part and without doubt have helped me get to where I am today."
