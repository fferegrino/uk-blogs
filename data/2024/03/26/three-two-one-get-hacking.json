From hardware including robotics and military devices to software utilising AI and the Internet of Things, the list is endless and you have it all at your fingertips when devising solutions to tackle some of defence\u2019s complex challenges. This equips people with a range of digital and technical skills that can then be brought back to benefit our projects."

In my role as a data analyst, it is important to be able to tackle projects creatively and often there is no one solution, so hackathons offer a great way of challenging your current ways of thinking to come up with different ways to solve problems. I found the event very insightful and I will definitely be signing up for more in the future.\""
