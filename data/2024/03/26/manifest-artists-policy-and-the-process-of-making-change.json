Outputs were first exhibited in Somerset House in a work-in-progress show in May 2023, then at Bloc Projects in Sheffield in December 2023. We, Policy Lab and the University of the Arts London, have recorded the ways that the programme can be said to have made a difference. We have observed that both policymaking and artmaking have been impacted. Policy professionals involved not only appreciated the effects/outcomes but were able to link them to specific \u2013 core \u2013 needs and problems they encounter in their work.\u202fThis can be classified under the following categories:\u00a0"

This is not only the sense that policy professionals see the need to do things differently given various technological and societal trends, but there is a desire to find new solutions for entrenched policy challenges. Dryden Goodwin spent time with Changing Futures, a cross-government programme seeking to improve outcomes for adults experiencing \u2018multiple disadvantage\u2019, defined as a challenging set of overlapping circumstances including homelessness, substance misuse, mental health issues, domestic abuse and contact with the criminal justice system. Dryden combined drawings, film and sound recordings to connect to a diversity of people within the complex policy system, including disadvantaged individuals, those involved in front line support and an assembly of people looking to redesign an entire approach to policy.\u00a0\u00a0"

Through the act of hand-picking their reference points from a variety of disciplines and systems of knowledge-making, Semiconductor emphasise the subjective nature of the gathering and editing process, raising questions around whose voice is heard and who is best placed to imagine potential futures.

We have learnt about the enthusiasm of policy professionals to be exposed to the day-to-day studio processes adopted by artists in their practices, potentially as an inspiration for bringing more creative thinking to their own policy practice. Policy professionals have expressed interest in using artworks directly in key decision-points relating to policies, for example as part of a consultation, stakeholder engagement workshop and cross-government deliberation. This highlights that there is \u2018internal\u2019 demand for engaging with artmaking, and artists, among the policy professionals. One dynamic that could be further tested would be the location in which the artworks might be displayed. Exhibiting work on a gallery wall, in a Minister\u2019s office or in a public-facing location could have profoundly different effects upon people involved at different stages of the policy cycle.\u00a0"
