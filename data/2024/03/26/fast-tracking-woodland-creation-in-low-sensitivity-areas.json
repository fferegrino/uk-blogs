Each proposal is unique and will be fully assessed on its merits.\u00a0\u00a0"

A site visit will help identify any unmapped or unrecorded environmental features that are likely to be adversely affected by tree planting, such as ancient hedgerows, veteran trees, fragments of priority habitats, wet flushes etc., even in low sensitivity areas. We can then apply appropriate mitigation measures to protect important features or conversely, refuse an application to protect those environmental features.\u00a0\u00a0"

For example, we will consider the appropriateness of soil preparation, the use of novel tree species, or the means of tree protection during establishment, all of which have a potential environmental risk.
