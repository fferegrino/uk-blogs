These changes are impacting the way geospatial applications can help to tackle global resilience challenges.\u00a0"

The geospatial community has an important role to play in this area, from being integral parts of resilience planning efforts to providing information to help with measuring, modelling and mitigating global risks.\u00a0"

            "text": "The overall aim of the Summit is to further build a collective understanding of how geospatial technology innovation is impacting on planning, mitigation and adaptation for these resilience issues. This could include new types of analysis that can be undertaken, considerations around speed, scale and cost, the management of shocks in real time or in the preparedness to and mitigation from resilience challenges. Outputs from the Summit discussions will be published later this year.\u00a0"

These innovations are enabling more rapid processing and interpolation of data. This gives us an opportunity to understand our environment, both natural and manmade, with an unprecedented frequency and level of detail. They also offer new opportunities to combine, interrogate and analyse data, creating new insights and knowledge in the process.\u00a0"
