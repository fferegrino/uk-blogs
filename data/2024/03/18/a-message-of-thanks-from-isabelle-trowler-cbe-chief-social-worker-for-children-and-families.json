It's a time to reflect\u00a0on the significant impact you make in improving the lives of others and how we can work together to try and resolve day to day\u00a0barriers to the best that social work can be."

            "text": "In Social Work Week, I\u2019m keen that you use the time together, to share good practice and most importantly,\u00a0enhance your skills\u00a0and\u00a0expand your knowledge\u00a0to continually improve the support you offer to the children, young\u00a0people\u00a0and families that you work with."

        {
            "text": "I\u2019d encourage you to read and reflect on the documents above and what they might mean for your practice and for practice within your local area.\u00a0Also take a look at the Foundations website which is full of information about best evidence when working with children and families. Only last week they published the results of a successful therapeutic programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children; and very recently have published groundbreaking research into family group decision making, which I would love to see in action across all local authorities."

They are in very frequent contact directly through their respective national networks, with both myself and the department. Hearing your views about social work practice helps make our policy making better."
