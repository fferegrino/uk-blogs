            "text": "Our role at the IPA is to provide expert project delivery advice, support and assurance to government departments and their major projects. The vast majority of our effort is focused on those projects in the Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). These projects represent the largest and most complex in government, and it follows that they are often the most expensive and difficult to deliver. It is therefore crucial that we take the time to properly learn the lessons from past GMPP projects and embed them fully into our delivery practices, so that we can realise our ambitions for public services and infrastructure, and secure the best value from the large sums of public funding invested in our major projects."

            "text": "The Elizabeth line is now so popular that it is hard to imagine life in London without it - around 700,000 journeys are made on midweek services, far-exceeding post-pandemic expectations. The popularity of the railway is perhaps not surprising given the savings in journey times that it has delivered, coupled with its accessibility and ultra-modern trains. But bringing the Elizabeth line into existence was not easy, and it is important that now the Crossrail project has been delivered, that we reflect on the challenges that we experienced and take the time to learn from those."

The report was created as a follow-up to the 2019 IPA and DfT publication \u2018Lessons from transport for the sponsorship of major projects\u2019, and it tests whether the 24 lessons highlighted in that original piece of work remain relevant and impactful.\u00a0"

Many projects in government use this type of model where a government department acts as the project sponsor - responsible for setting requirements, owning the business case, and ensuring that the expected benefits are delivered \u2013 but where the hands-on delivery is managed by a separate entity that has the necessary capacity and capability to design and deliver the project, and contract suppliers as part of that.\u00a0"

These lessons are underpinned by over 90 interviews with key project stakeholders, multiple workshops, and hours of reading, in order to ensure that the lessons are based on reliable evidence. Its publication is the culmination of the hard work of its author (Matthew Symes, supported also by Rob Brighouse), the concerted efforts of DfT, TfL, and IPA, and also expertise and peer review supplied by the Association for Project Managers (APM) and the Major Projects Association (MPA).\u00a0"
