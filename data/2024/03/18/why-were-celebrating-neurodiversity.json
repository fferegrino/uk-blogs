I respected the civil service as an employer and wanted to develop and progress within it, but my lack of academic achievements held me back, as did my self-criticism. I was diagnosed with dyslexia later in life, quickly recognising there was a stigma attached to neurodiversity. Something about being dyslexic seemed to stop people from wanting to employ me."

The great thing about the network is that it has colleagues who are neurodiverse joining, and colleagues who are not, but all simply wish to learn more to help themselves and their colleagues. Everyone is respectful, we work together to help each other, and the network really does feel like my family."

It\u2019s amazing how much more productive an organisation can be when their communications resonate with anyone, no matter their communications needs, and it is amazing how much more colleagues thrive when they feel \u2018heard\u2019."
