It is very grounding to realise you are less cut out for these places than the unassuming plants at your feet \u2013 cord grass, sea asters and glassworts.\u00a0"

I work on a catchment scale, looking at the pressures and challenges across the whole land area (the watershed) that drains water off the land, from source to sea. The pressures, the geographies, and people\u2019s priorities and interests are as diverse as the natural habitats and \u2013 while it is a clich\u00e9 \u2013 no two days are ever the same.\u00a0"

The Dart estuary, like many in South Devon, is a ria (a narrow, flooded river valley) with pockets of saltmarsh nestled among a mosaic of mudflats, reedbeds, rocky shores and open water.\u00a0"
