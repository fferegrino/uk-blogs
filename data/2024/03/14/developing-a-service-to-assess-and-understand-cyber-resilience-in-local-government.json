To guide the local government sector through the CAF, DLUHC is developing supporting documentation, guidance and templates. We\u2019re calling this the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) for local government."

This will likely include working closely with partners such as SOLACE or the Local Government Association (LGA)."

We\u2019re keen to understand the resource required to undertake the CAF and to design the service to reduce additional burden on councils. By thoroughly testing the CAF with councils, we can identify the pain points and which elements are the most time and resource consuming."

We have also undertaken a discovery project to explore what services DLUHC needs to build to support delivery of the CAF in local government."
