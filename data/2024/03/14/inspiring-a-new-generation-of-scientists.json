In this blog, we hear from APHA STEM ambassadors, Nichola Stamper, Estella Gonzalez-Fernandez and Amy Parkes-Withers, on why inspiring the next generation of scientists is so rewarding and what it means to them."

I hosted a group of Level 2 General Farm Worker Apprenticeship students to tell them more about APHA and our work at Penrith Veterinary Investigation Centre. The students were extremely interested, asking lots of questions, and learned about job roles in our lab."

            "text": "More recently, I offered my support to a local secondary school, Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Penrith, by taking part in a Year 11 mock interview day. I am involved with recruitment in my main job as Laboratory Manager of Penrith Regional Lab, so was very keen to help students to develop their interview skills and promote APHA as a future employer. It was a bit daunting walking into the school\u2019s main hall, with lots of small desks in rows \u2013 I had a flash back to my own exam days! I really enjoyed the day: I was so impressed with all the students I interviewed, and they were confident and open to feedback. The experience was very rewarding, and I hope I have helped the students to develop key skills which will aid them in future careers."

            "text": "My presentation focused on vector-borne diseases and the impact of global change in their transmission. I provided an overview of these diseases, highlighting the involvement of insects and other arthropods. We explored some examples illustrating the impact of climate change and global trade on the epidemiology of these diseases. I also talked about what we do at APHA to investigate and find answers so that we can understand the epidemiology of these diseases and the potential impact they could have in the UK, so we are better prepared to safeguard UK biosecurity."

Moreover, it encouraged my confidence and provided valuable insights for improving future presentations. I look forward to applying this experience in future talks."

For this activity, all volunteers, colleges, and employers were placed on a desk in a classroom and pupils came around in small groups to ask us questions. All groups of pupils visited each desk for five minutes, and there were a lot of different questions they wanted answers to in that short amount of time."

            "text": "Being able to speak to the pupils in small groups meant almost every student asked a question.
