With a strong focus on collaboration with a range of partners, we work to safeguard and enhance our biodiversity and geodiversity for people and nature."

We have a team of Earth Scientists, for example, who are tasked with the conservation and enhancement of our rich and extremely diverse geological and geomorphological heritage representing around 600 million years of time. This ensures that the places, features and fossils which enable us to understand the history of our planet, past environmental change, and the evolution and adaption of life adaptation in response to these changes, are conserved and managed, enabling us to understand the past and plan for the future."

            "text": "We have life scientists working to conserve and enhance England\u2019s biodiversity, and we have social scientists looking at how people interact with the environment. We also have teams assessing and evaluating our past and current work to ascertain what has worked/is working best for people, places, and nature, and we have Futures Specialists who scan the horizon to assess what issues are emerging and how they may affect our future. Science truly is at the core of all we do."

            "text": "The way we do our science has changed tremendously across the decades. We use scientific advancements that were unimaginable when Natural England\u2019s predecessor bodies were first established. For example, Environmental DNA (eDNA) identifies species present in a particular environment from small samples. We conduct Environmental DNA \u2018Bioblitzes\u2019, which assess all the biodiversity of a given location. Earth observation from satellites would have been pure science fiction when the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act came into force; Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging,) was first used in the 1960s and is now routinely used to identify tiny height differences across sites that are essential for understanding water movement across sites. It goes almost without saying the computers we use every day - whether simply to send an email or to process huge datasets - are far more powerful now than the first computers we used when the organisation began. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the rate at which technology is evolving presents exciting possibilities for the future, especially in terms of data analysis and geographic information."

Research on NNRs continues today with new NNRs designated each year, opening up further opportunities to learn what conservation actions work best."

            "text": "Just over a year ago, Government launched its Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP), which arose from the 25 Year Environment Plan (25YEP). We\u2019ve already been successful in achieving some of the targets set out in the EIP. For example, the recent closure of sandeel fisheries in the English North Sea waters. The closure will bring a number of benefits to the area, including the recovery of sandeel populations; they are a vital food source for commercially important seafood species such as haddock and whiting as well as benefitting seabirds and porpoises. It was our evidence and advice to government that made the decision to close the area possible."

This work is critical for preserving our marine environments, which play a significant part in the overall health of our planet."

From understanding environmental changes to what works in nature recovery, it sets out our goals to continually improve the evidence base, to invest in the scientific expertise of our staff and to work with our partners to drive innovative approaches, and to share our knowledge and understanding."
