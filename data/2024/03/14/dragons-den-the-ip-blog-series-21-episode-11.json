            "text": "Kitty explained that when she had looked for play makeup for Nel and Tessie, she was unable to find any available in the UK with purely natural ingredients. She\u2019d discovered a gap in the market - consumers who are waking up to the need for products that are kind to the skin as well as the planet. That\u2019s when she started The Natural Play Makeup Company."

Consumer education would be a key element of building the brand\u2019s success, she advised."

She has found the repetitive process of hand baking more than 15,000 boxes of her allergen-free vegan granola bars therapeutic, helping to alleviate her anxiety and reduce the symptoms of her neuro-divergent conditions."

He has a patent and a patent pending for his Time:O:Stat invention \u2013 an easy to use thermostat for students and tenants in rented accommodation. The timer function can greatly reduce the cost of heating for landlords of multiple occupancy homes, Anthony assured the Den."
