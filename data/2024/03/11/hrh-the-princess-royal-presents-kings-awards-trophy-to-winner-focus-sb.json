I have been in manufacturing of electrical products all of my career and I started off as a 16-year-old technical apprentice and have worked my way through various businesses from technical to marketing, sales and general management and I have been an MD of two manufacturing companies, including currently with Focus SB.\""

After all, manufacturing accounts for 2.6 million jobs in the UK and we are the 8th largest manufacturing country in the world!\u201d"
