At that point, I couldn\u2019t imagine that the Civil Service would provide me with such incredible opportunities and career progression."

I wanted to build my skills and experience outside of my compliance role. After only a few months, I began to gain the skills that I needed. I earned an Operational Delivery Professional qualification, was more confident in my abilities, and I was ready for the next step in my career. This is where Companies House came in."

With my combination of management skills and compliance casework experience, I felt I was the ideal fit for this varied and fast-paced role. In March 2020 I was asked to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I still had a lot of training to complete, but the support from my manager and colleagues helped me progress in my role. The people here at Companies House are its biggest asset."

Two years later I gained promotion to Intelligence, Integrity, Compliance and Enforcement Senior Manager. This was a very challenging but incredibly rewarding role where I gained experience in new areas of work."

I love the varied nature of the work and the responsibility of leading the Northern Ireland team through significant changes to UK company law. Managing such a strong, friendly, multi-skilled team is a privilege and one that I\u2019ll appreciate throughout my career."

Being nominated was a great acknowledgement of my work during the year. This year the Civil Service Awards received an unprecedented 1,962 nominations across 12 categories. This is the highest number of nominations received in the Awards\u2019 18-year history. You can imagine my surprise when I was shortlisted in the top 3 and invited to the awards ceremony at Lancaster House in London!"

I was delighted to get to the final 3 and winning the award was unexpected. As I stood on stage, blinded by the light, I remembered the most important piece of information given to us \u2013 \u201cdon't fall off the back of the stage\u201d. Fortunately for me I have a dog-like obedience and listen to instructions intently, so I avoided being the night\u2019s embarrassment."

This is all while maintaining our brilliant culture as we transform from a passive recipient of information to an active gatekeeper of the data on our register."
