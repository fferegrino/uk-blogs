Day to day, the care I receive has been finely tuned and personalised to maximise the way I wish to live my life. Investing in my PA\u2019s has been an ongoing priority. If I invest in the care and support of my team, it means I directly reap the benefits through the quality of their care provision."

Before that I was in a short-stay MDT setting for assessments and reablement for adults following hospital discharge or community referral and other varied roles in the sector."
