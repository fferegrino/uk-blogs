            "text": "Today, the Responsible Tech Adoption Unit (RTA) in DSIT and the CDDO (Central Digital and Data Office) are launching updated products to better support public sector organisations in using the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS). This includes a new gov.uk repository for ATRS records which will scale to support increased usage of the ATRS, and an incremental update to the ATRS itself in response to feedback. This aims to more clearly separate information relating to the models and datasets, enabling the ATRS to be applied more easily for commodity models deployed in different use cases."

            "text": "These enhancements follow the announcement in the recent government response to the consultation on the AI White Paper that use of the ATRS will become a requirement for UK government departments, with an intent to extend to the broader public sector over time."

        {
            "text": "We are also introducing regular opportunities to join an ATRS cohort: a group of similar teams all completing transparency records, following the same timelines for writing and publishing. Sharing innovation, experiences and best practice is a key benefit of transparency and being part of a cohort will maximise this opportunity. Cohorts will be open to everyone across the public sector, but for central government in particular this will be a way to get support and share experiences in the run up to the ATRS being mandatory."

The ATRS, internationally recognised as best practice, was developed through a co-design process with UK citizens, and has been trialled right across the public sector, including with central and local government, police forces and regulators."

We\u2019ve included guidance on mitigating the risks to IP, security and gaming posed by making information public. We\u2019ve incorporated a wide range of feedback from government, industry, and the general public. In this update, we\u2019ve looked to improve the public sector user experience \u2013 both ease of using the ATRS, and making it interoperable with other RTA products that are currently under development."

Cohorts will work in parallel to complete their ATRS records and publish them together. It comes with the added benefit of offering participating government departments a strategic head start on ATRS record publication, ensuring readiness for an increased ATRS mandate in the future."

You will have access to workshops run by the ATRS team, opportunities to communicate share approaches with other participants, and a responsive team who will answer questions, review your record and prepare you to publish. You will be able to work alongside others also completing transparency records, share experiences and best practice. Cohorts will span approximately nine weeks, and finish with the publication of a batch of records to our online repository."

Over 2024, we will be implementing this increased mandate, and finalising the detailed scope, including some limited but necessary exemption (e.g. for national security). While this exercise is ongoing, we will determine timelines for departments to complete and publish records and how the ATRS team can best support an increased rate of record publication."
