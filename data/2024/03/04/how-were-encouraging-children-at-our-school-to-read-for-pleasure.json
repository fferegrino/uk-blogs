We conducted a survey with staff that showed only 38% of teachers read children\u2019s literature beyond the directed class texts. Staff were not naturally choosing to read these books, so we made a decision to take a more planned approach."

We placed a particular emphasis on new authors and texts, and books aimed at age groups beyond the specific key stage they worked in. We also covered specific genres and authors including poetry and graphic novels."

Through the tracker we can see if a child is \u2018getting stuck\u2019 in a book that they\u2019re not truly enjoying, allowing us to make interventions and direct children\u2019s reading choices. By expanding teacher\u2019s knowledge of children\u2019s literature, we can quickly introduce children to alternative titles and authors available in both our classroom and school libraries."

Attendance at our lunchtime library club increased significantly, and it was great to see so many children engaged in reading discussion and positive reading behaviours. One child told us \u201cIt was good to see the teachers enjoying reading too and reading with us. It feels like we share the books together\u201d, and this is the exact sort of experience we want them to have."

Over the next academic year, we\u2019re going to build on our momentum and continue to try more things to encourage our children\u2019s love of reading. We are looking to further develop our teacher/parent reading group and want to continue to develop our outdoor spaces to promote recreational reading even further. We\u2019re also hoping to develop wider community links, including forming reading buddies with residents of our local nursing home."
