Any land proposed for use for off-site BNG must be a registered biodiversity gain site. To be eligible for registration on the gain site register, land must be secured by one of two legal mechanisms. The first are planning obligations with local planning authorities (LPAs) under section 106 Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the Act). The second legal mechanism is conservation covenants."

An obligation can require a person to do something on land or restrict what can be done on land and may be conditional or unconditional. Planning obligations are registered as Local Land Charges. They run with the land and are enforceable against the people entering into the obligation and their successors, such as a subsequent owners of the land. All planning obligations must be legal instruments executed as deeds."

It delivers lasting conservation benefit for the public good. A covenant sets out obligations in respect of the land which will be legally binding not only on the landowner but on subsequent owners of the land. So far these have yet to be used (at the time of writing). See the list of designated responsible bodies."

That is, they can be used without any linked planning application when securing off-site biodiversity units (BUs), unless the habitat enhancement works needed planning consent. Be assured that this is perfectly OK!"

It will also need to contain the \u2018at least 30 years\u2019 management and maintenance obligations relating to those enhancements. These two provisions need to be clearly and separately stated. This is because the 30-year maintenance obligation imposed by the legislation must start after the completion of the habitat enhancement works (see s100(2)(b) Environment Act 2021)."

Nevertheless, in all situations, there needs to be clear obligations over the habitat enhancement works as well as obligations for the 30-year maintenance period which starts from the completion of those enhancement works. Guidance is available to help with this."

We would also expect the LPA to have land entry and step in rights to allow it to effectively enforce the landowner\u2019s obligations. In addition, we would expect the landowner to agree to providing reasonable funds to allow the LPA to perform this role. For example, an up-front lump sum or interim payments over the 30-year period."

Also, the statutory biodiversity metric reduces the number of habitat units generated for off-site works outside of the boundary of the LPA or National Character Area (NCA). Habitat units from neighbouring LPAs or NCAs will be reduced by 25%. Habitat units from outside neighbouring LPAs or NCAs will be reduced by 50%. Gaining insight into where the land will be is necessary for LPAs to understand how many habitat units are required."

This may be the greatest challenge as this is very new to all involved."

            "text": "Once you have a buyer, both parties will need to enter a contract to give effect to the sale. This involves transferring or allocating the units to the developer and securing payment from the developer to the seller. This is a new type of transaction with no established precedents. It is likely a developer will want to start with an \u2018option agreement\u2019. Under this, developers can reserve the option to purchase the units upon receiving planning permission, by paying a non-refundable deposit to the seller. The remainder paid if the developers exercise the option. This means that when the developer successfully obtains their planning permission, they pay the remainder. The deposit, or reserve fee, is paid upon signing the option agreement, effectively rewarding the landowner for reserving units during the option period."
