At around 5am, the amount of the Sun\u2019s light hitting the surface of the Moon will be reduced slightly as our planet causes a slight shadow. However, because the Moon, Earth and the Sun are not perfectly aligned, sunlight reaching the Moon is diffused only slightly, so there\u2019ll only be a subtle change in brightness."

            "text": "As they get closer to the Sun\u2019s radiation, interactions with the gas, dust and ice on the comet can cause outbursts on the surface, ejecting material into a plume or \u2018tail\u2019."

This comet has earned the nickname of the \u2018Devil Comet\u2019 in recent months as one of several eruptions caused a second plume of material to stream from its surface, giving it the appearance of having horns."

It\u2019ll move steadily through the tip of Pisces, just under Triangulum and end the month on the line of brighter stars in Aries, appearing to move in the direction of Jupiter. In reality the comet is moving toward the inner solar system where it will reach its closest point to the Sun next month."
