            "text": "Local authorities spend significant time and resources connecting residents with relevant community services, handling over 2 million requests related to adult social care alone in 2021/22. Each council maintains their own directory of community services but managing this information is challenging, often leading to duplication of efforts even within the same local area. Different organisations also hold and share their information in different ways. This means that directories can lack consistency and residents find it difficult to access the right information.\u00a0"
