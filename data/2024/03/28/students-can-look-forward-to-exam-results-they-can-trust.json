Of course, I taught many students who needed extra support or a boost to their confidence \u2013 preparing for exams is a significant challenge for some. But I also remember vividly how so many students who go through a crisis of confidence rise to the challenge, with the help of their teachers, family and friends. And the pride every parent and teacher shares with the student when that happens is worth its weight in gold."

A student in my old school who, having come from a family where no-one had studied beyond the age of 16 before, worked incredibly hard for her GCSEs, took science and maths A levels, and managed to secure an apprenticeship with Jaguar Land Rover, conditional on high A level grades. Those degree apprenticeships are very competitive. She and her parents could hardly believe it when they opened that envelope in August. It only happened because she was motivated to work for her qualifications to achieve a better future for herself."

Everyone sits them at the same time under the same conditions, and they\u2019re marked by expert examiners who have no preconceptions about a student\u2019s ability. In fact, examiners don\u2019t even know the students\u2019 names, which schools they attend or even which part of the country they\u2019re from."

            "text": "We require exam boards and awarding organisations to have robust quality assurance processes for marking and moderating in place. Once exam scripts have been marked, highly experienced examiners agree grade boundaries which reflect any slight changes in the difficulty of each particular exam from previous years. This process ensures that year on year it is no harder or easier to get a particular grade. Each student then gets a grade based on their own individual performance in that exam. There\u2019s no set quota of grades \u2013 I can\u2019t stress this strongly enough. Grades are awarded purely on a student\u2019s performance. And if you look back across the years, there are variations in the number of students getting any particular grade, from the highest to the lowest. That\u2019s because the performance of students naturally varies a little from year to year."
