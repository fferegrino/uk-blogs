We have trained thousands of policy professionals in multidisciplinary approaches. We have run more than 250 innovation projects in some of the UK\u2019s most challenging and high-profile areas of policy. We have worked in almost every government department in the UK and beyond, for organisations such as universities and local authorities, and for international bodies including the United Nations. We have also engaged with many thousands of people outside government to understand how policies affect their daily lives.\u00a0\u00a0"

Our MANIFEST programme, launched in 2022, evaluates the potential role for artistic approaches in policymaking \u2013 to date, we have placed eight artists in policy teams. In 2023, we published People-Centred Policy Design, a free-to-access, five-week course enabling participants to explore a range of participatory and innovation methods. This year we also soft-launched RegBox, a toolkit using serious games, which enables policy professionals to convene stakeholders and work together to make decisions affecting regulation.\u00a0"
