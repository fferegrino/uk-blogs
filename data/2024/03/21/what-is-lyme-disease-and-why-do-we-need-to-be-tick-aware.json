Remove any attached tick as soon as you find it using a tick-removal tool or fine-tipped tweezers. Fine-tipped tweezers are different from regular tweezers that might be used to remove eyebrow hair. They are very narrow and pointed at the tip and ensure that ticks are not squashed during removal."

            "text": "Lyme disease is an infection that can be transmitted by ticks found in the UK, though it should be remembered that not all ticks carry the bacteria which causes Lyme disease and not all bites from an infected tick will result in human infection. The disease can be acquired when someone is bitten by an infected tick, usually outdoors in green spaces where ticks might be present. Lyme disease should not deter you from enjoying the outdoors because you can reduce your chance of infection by following the precautions above."

If untreated, it can cause a wider range of symptoms in some people such as multiple rashes on other parts of the body, facial droop, shooting nerve pain and, rarely, palpitations or joint swelling. Most patients treated in the later stages of infection also respond very well to antibiotics, although some may have long-term damage to their joints or the nervous system."

Not everyone will realise that they were bitten by a tick, so you may still develop Lyme disease symptoms without remembering a tick bite. There are national guidelines for doctors, providing advice on diagnosis and management of Lyme disease."
