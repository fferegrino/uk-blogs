Water companies are already running campaigns focused on ways we can save water, but this alone isn\u2019t enough. We all need to do our bit by taking responsibility and tackling water wastage. Water companies need to repair infrastructure, install smart meters and engage with their customers, to help them save water too. This will mean that less water will be taken from the environment, less water and wastewater needs to be pumped and treated, and fewer new supplies will be needed.\u00a0\u00a0"
