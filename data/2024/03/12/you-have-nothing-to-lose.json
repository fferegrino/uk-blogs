The programme demonstrates to employers that the incredible skills and attributes young adult carers develop directly as a result of their caring role, can also be directly transferred into the workplace. These include excellent time-management skills, a sense of responsibility for other people and the importance of being able to prioritise and juggle lots of tasks \u2013 and budgets \u2013 simultaneously."
