There are numerous pieces of coverage with the story running on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme and on ITV bulletins."

            "text": "The council faces significant financial challenges that have been widely reported and that are as a result of severe mismanagement. This includes an admission of its backdated equal pay liability, currently estimated by the council as being up to \u00a3760 million, along with an in-year budget deficit that includes the costs of implementing an IT system. These deficits were too significant for the council to manage."

They have the powers to provide advice and challenge the council over their budgeting decisions, to help protect the interests of taxpayers and residents. They also have powers relating to governance, scrutiny of strategic decision making, finance and senior appointments."

This will increase their overall funding for next year to \u00a364.7 billion \u2013 a 7.5% increase in cash terms on 2023/24."

This flexibility allows them to meet revenue costs through capital resources \u2013 for example through the sale of council held assets."
