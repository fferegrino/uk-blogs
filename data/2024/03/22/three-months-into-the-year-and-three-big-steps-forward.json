This set out plans to boost the UK\u2019s energy security and achieve net zero carbon emissions, with up to a quarter of Britain\u2019s energy produced from nuclear power by 2050. Access to nuclear sites is a critical factor in achieving these nuclear ambitions, which included deploying SMRs and exploring a further large-scale reactor project after Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C."

The roadmap provides a timeline for when the next steps for exploring a large-scale power plant as big as Sizewell in Suffolk or Hinkley in Somerset will be communicated."

These vendors will now have until June 2024 to submit their tender responses. We will then assess these responses, aiming to announce the successful bidders later in 2024.
