Only 2012, 2000, 1960, 1872 and 1852 were wetter (data sourced from the Met Office National Climate Information Centre). However, heavy rainfall doesn\u2019t take away from water companies\u2019 obligation to maintain their assets or the need for greater operational investment.\u00a0\u00a0"

More monitors mean more data (there were 14,241 overflows with monitors installed in 2023 compared with 13,323 in 2022). In previous years, any storm overflows without a monitor were not being counted. However, on average each overflow operated more times in 2023 than it did in 2022.

Any water companies in breach of their permits are acting illegally and must act urgently to address any non-compliance. We will always seek to hold those responsible for environmental harm to account. If we identify illegal discharges from storm overflows, we investigate them, and action is taken in line with our Enforcement and Sanctions Policy. For example, in 2023, Yorkshire Water breached its environmental permit with an unauthorised sewage discharge. It submitted an Enforcement Undertaking to the Environment Agency proposing a charitable donation totalling \u00a31m which is the largest ever accepted by the Agency. At the start of 2024, the Environment Agency also prosecuted Severn Trent water for a huge discharge of raw sewage at treatment works in Stoke with Severn Trent ordered to pay a fine of over \u00a32m. \u00a0"

However, there are exceptions which must also be considered, such as in very large catchments with long drain down times. We carry out a detailed modelling process, looking at local rainfall gauges and drainage times \u2013 as well as Met Office data \u2013 to establish if dry spills have happened. When data indicates that dry spills may have occurred, this is followed by an investigation on a site-by-site basis.\u00a0"
