So much of our infrastructure is designed and constructed without understanding and considering the needs of the different users, including women. If we are striving for better outcomes, we need to make sure we have diversity and representation across all levels, including senior levels. This is about unlocking talent for the purpose of better outcomes."

The nature of climate change is that it is systemic, and regressive. That means that what happens in one part of the world, or particular system, can catastrophically impact somewhere else.\u00a0"

She talks of the silent, yet persistent, social inequalities that can and do restrict access to contributing to tackling these \u2018grand challenges\u2019. As long as these imbalances and exclusions exist, we will not properly understand the real issues and therefore we certainly won't develop the solutions needed.\u00a0"

While I grew up in a traditional home, where dad went to work, fixed the car etc, and mum stayed at home, cooked, cleaned and fed us, I was never aware of male/female roles. I believe that's because of the regard and respect my parents had for each other as people. My sister and I were given the freedom to make our choices, were taught how to change spark plugs and do an oil change, and at no point did I feel I was identified by my gender.\u00a0"
