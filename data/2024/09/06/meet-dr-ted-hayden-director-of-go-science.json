            "text": "GSE team:\u00a0Hi Ted, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today about your career. To start, can you tell us a bit about your current role as the Director of GO-Science?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Ted: Absolutely. As Director, I oversee GO-Science, which ensures that excellent science advice is put at the heart of decision-making. This is the main objective for the Government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser and central to all our activities. Alongside this, I am responsible for making sure GO-Science is a great place to work and building an organisation where people can flourish and fulfil their potential. I love working in GO-Science and that\u2019s because our people are really invested in their work and passionate about driving towards a common goal. It\u2019s fantastic to get good science advice taken seriously across government and talk about such a wide range of topics with interesting experts."

        {
            "text": "GSE team:\u00a0That sounds like a significant responsibility but a really interesting role. Can you share your career journey that led you to this position?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Of course. My entry into government was through the Science and Engineering Fast Stream, over a decade ago. With a PhD in Physical Chemistry, I was eager to apply my scientific knowledge in a new way and bring impact to a wide range of people. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the integration of science and evidence into government policy, so the Science and Engineering Fast Stream seemed like the perfect fit for me. \u00a0After getting through the application process, I was placed into the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)."

            "text": "GSE team:\u00a0Given your background, it seems like you were quite focused on science from the start?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Yes, but interestingly, despite my scientific background, my assignments were in strategy and policy rather than direct scientific roles. This trajectory took me through various strategy positions related to energy, infrastructure, industrial strategy, and transport. I was involved in both strategy development, policy, as well as project delivery."

            "text": "GSE team:\u00a0And how did these experiences prepare you for your current role?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Each role provided me with a broader understanding of how science underpins effective government policy. When the chance to become the Director of GO-Science presented itself, it felt like a culmination of my career journey. It was a chance to be part of GO-Science, an organisation I had worked closely with a number of times throughout my career, and to support the new Chief Scientific Adviser, Dame Angela McLean, which is a fantastic opportunity."

        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Certainly. My journey began in the Department of Energy and Climate Change, focusing on renewable energy and leading on various special projects within their strategy team. I then joined the National Infrastructure Commission during its inception under George Osborne, leading the development of the National Infrastructure Assessment. Following that, I transitioned to the newly established Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to work on the industrial strategy under the then Prime Minister Theresa May, working on both the Green Paper and White Paper and then delivery."

        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0I moved to the Department of Transport to lead their strategy unit. It was a fantastic role where I got to lead on a range of areas, from managing the general election planning in the department, overseeing multiple Spending Reviews, leading on the department\u2019s strategic priorities and helping steer the department through a Covid-19 recovery programme. Following that role, I then went into a new project delivery job, where I managed a portfolio of local transport infrastructure projects worth around \u00a38 billion, including through the Levelling Up Fund and the City Regional Sustainable Transport Settlements (money that goes to Mayoral Combined Authorities for local transport). And then, just over a year ago, I took on the role of Director at GO-Science."

        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Of course. I hold a PhD in Surface Science from the University of Cambridge. Interestingly, my PhD supervisor was Dave King, a former Chief Government Scientific Adviser. It\u2019s quite funny how things come about!"

        },

            "text": "Ted:\u00a0I graduated from Cardiff University with a degree in Chemistry. And yes, whilst there as an undergraduate, I did work at various Cardiff high street hotspots \u2013 from Schuh to Tiger Tiger."

        },
        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0With pleasure. My thesis was titled \u201cA Supersonic Molecular Beam Study of Oxygen Containing Species on Palladium (100) and Copper (311).\u201d It was quite the endeavour and something I am proud to have achieved, particularly as I had to finish writing it up during my first year on the Fast Stream."

            "text": "Ted:\u00a0My love for science and experiments is matched by my passion for working with people and making a tangible impact on their lives. I wanted to apply my scientific knowledge in a way that directly contributed to making people\u2019s lives better. While academia has its merits, sometimes working alone in a lab didn\u2019t quite deliver on the people aspect, so the prospect of working collaboratively with others and influencing real-world outcomes drew me to the civil service."

        {
            "text": "Ted:\u00a0Absolutely. I\u2019ve always sought roles that offer new challenges and opportunities to innovate. I believe in doing work that excites me, rather than meticulously planning a career path. For me, it\u2019s about the joy of the job and its relevance to my interests, not just its potential to enhance my CV."

            "text": "Ted:\u00a0It has for me. Not having a rigid plan has allowed me to embrace opportunities that align with my passions. This approach has served me well, leading me to fulfilling roles where I have been able do meaningful work and contribute positively to different departments \u2013 I hope people I have worked with have felt that too."

I recommend seeking roles that genuinely interest you and work with people you enjoy collaborating with. \u00a0All roles you undertake have a way you can build, develop and shape the work that will contribute to your skill set. Additionally, engage in activities beyond your primary responsibilities, such as corporate initiatives, which can provide exposure to new areas of work and innovative approaches."
