In the fifth video and blog of the series, Kath Illidge, Head of Customer Engagement and Support, talks about her role and the importance of customer service within RPA."

At RPA we\u2019re always listening to our customers\u2019 concerns and issues. My role is to support and lead change that improves the customer experience, as well as develop processes that make it easier for both customers and those who provide the services."

            "text": "A typical day for me would involve talking to customers, stakeholders and our people to understand how we can improve customer service. Interacting with customers is a really great part of my role that I enjoy, especially when I can help alleviate their concerns and support them in what they\u2019re trying to achieve."

            "text": "We\u2019re also looking at how we can be more approachable and accessible to our customers. I think the aspect of my role that will have the greatest impact on our customers in the future is reaching out to rural businesses that may have struggled in the past to connect with RPA. We\u2019re also looking to expand our regional support networks so we\u2019re more accessible and relevant at a local level."

It\u2019s been challenging, but the reward is seeing how people have strengthened their attitude and approach towards customers and the benefits it gives them."

I\u2019ve been mainly based in operational delivery, which has included leading teams from the call centre, the processing of schemes, complaints and appeals. I also have experience in planning and resourcing, and have been involved in a variety of projects that have delivered improvements for RPA and our customers."

My family no longer farm, but I still live in a rural area and I want to contribute to the rural economy and community."

You can watch them \u2013 an interview with Customer Director Marie Hardeman and her thoughts on customer service here, with Emily Edwards and Gareth Jones, as well as with Marie, Gareth and Emily, so if you haven\u2019t already, do listen and read more about what they do and how they work together to support those who use our services."
