Last Summer we made a major change to these online systems, with the intention of helping charities to solve problems they had reported to us and making it easier for charities to engage with us.\u00a0\u00a0"

Such shared log ins are not what people are now used to when interacting with online platforms, nor was this satisfactory in the long term from a data protection perspective. More fundamentally, we wanted to create an online platform that would help us to build a more bespoke, two-way relationship with the people who are responsible for the charities we regulate.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is a new way for charities to access our online services, offering each trustee or authorised employee an individual login. This means it will also be easier for those who are trustees of multiple charities to see all the information they need on one dashboard. It is now the go-to place for trustees to submit their annual returns and update their charity details. In time, we hope it will also enable a long-term shift whereby individual trustees have a more direct digital connection with us.\u00a0"

As our former CEO acknowledged in our recent annual report, despite increased staffing levels, these issues increased volumes of calls and emails into our contact centre, which in turn put pressure on waiting times. These long waits, whilst perhaps not unusual in peoples\u2019 experience of other call centres, are not to the standards we have grown used to providing to charity trustees and staff, and we apologise again to those who were kept waiting. Now call and email volumes are back at more manageable levels, waiting times have reduced significantly.\u00a0"

We have already made some improvements, and we will be implementing further tweaks and fixes in the months ahead as we refine the system. And we\u2019ll continue to use both your experience of using MCCA and our experience of rolling the system out to learn lessons and improve how we plan for future changes.\u00a0"

It is still always advisable for trustees to file their charity\u2019s annual returns in good time ahead of their deadline. This is particularly helpful for charities due to file in October and January, which are our busiest months and when our contact centre is always busier than at other times of the year. And it\u2019s important that, if a charity contact moves on, they ensure that another person in the charity is set up to administer MCCA once they\u2019ve left. There\u2019s advice on this, and other aspects of managing an MCCA account, available on our website.\u00a0"

We are grateful to charities for their patience and for all their work to ensure they are keeping their details up to date and filing their annual returns and accounts. We are confident that MCCA will bring long-term improvements in trustees\u2019 relationship with us, supporting charities to be transparent and accountable on our register and, ultimately, helping them to fulfil their essential role in enhancing lives and strengthening society.\u00a0"
