The mining took a toll, leaving parts of the area damaged and affecting the environment around it. Now, thanks to careful planning, the site is being restored to bring natural beauty. This restoration doesn\u2019t just mean new woodlands but also connecting the site to nearby forests and habitats, creating larger spaces for wildlife to thrive.\u00a0"

A mix of broadleaves and conifers have been chosen to create a balance for wildlife and help soak up carbon, which is great for tackling climate change and nature. For example, over 22,000 native trees and shrubs, like field maple, alder, birch, aspen, and rowan, were planted in the eastern part of Minorca. The goal was to create a woodland area that blends smoothly into the surrounding farmland. It\u2019s about making sure the landscape feels connected.\u00a0\u00a0"

New parkland, wetland ponds, and wildflower seeding areas are being added to attract a variety of birds, like tree sparrows, song thrushes, linnets, and yellowhammers. Wildflowers have been sown along the site\u2019s edges, which not only make the area more colourful but also attract essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Plus, there are new public footpaths and bridleways for off-road walking and riding, making the area more accessible for all.\u00a0"

The University of Nottingham is testing biochar there, which is basically organic material that has been carbonised under high temperatures in the presence of little, or no oxygen. When added to the soil, it locks carbon in and we are monitoring plant growth and nutrients to determine the added benefits. This field trial is being extended to other parts of the site to learn more about sustainable land management.\u00a0"
