YLHTs are members within beekeeping associations who are often called when potential sightings of yellow-legged hornets are reported."

            "text": "Many of the hornet nests in Kent were found near Dover, Deal, and Folkestone, areas known for their beekeeping communities. Our first sighting of the day was in a village near Dover. Beekeepers, Sue Court and Eric Cattrell, were observing yellow-legged hornets hawking their bees in the garden."

            "text": "While we awaited the arrival of the full National Bee Unit \u00a0team, Eric and I spent the morning setting up a trap in his garden. We made the most of this time by observing the hornets and mapping out their flight path after feeding. We realised we needed additional help to monitor the hornets' flight direction from the other side of the house and were eagerly anticipating the arrival of the NBU team to begin our work."

Their support, along with that of the local community, was crucial in our journey to successfully locating the hornet nest."

A plan was developed swiftly, and things moved fast. Jackie shared her insights on how Dover beekeepers could contribute, demonstrating a thorough understanding, meticulous planning, and unwavering determination that Dover would hold the line against a yellow-legged hornet incursion."

The table, covered in a full-sized Ordnance Survey map of Kent, is marked with sticky label dots, which show the monitoring traps set out by her army of Dover volunteers. They complement traps set by the NBU in areas where active track and trace (T&T) are taking place. Each sticky dot is placed in a grid at a measured distance, to make sure that there are a sufficient number of traps across the region."

            "text": "Jackie\u2019s local YLHT army, and particularly her husband Allyn, were absolutely focussed on setting out and then monitoring the traps. Monitoring traps is the first vital step in finding any hornet nest. They provided immediate feedback on hornets found to Jackie, who coordinated the response both on her map, and to Tom, who organised the rapid dispatch of an advanced NBU team to set up bait stations ready for T&T to commence. This dynamic teamwork resulted in multiple nests being rapidly located and destroyed around the Dover and Southeast Kent area."

            "text": "This working relationship was incredibly successful, and Jackie, along with a selection of her dedicated YLHT team, were invited to observe one of the T&Ts with an NBU team working in the area. The work was physically demanding, and their stamina was commendable, staying with the team for several days, not wishing to miss a thing. All expressed how much they enjoyed contributing to the experience, although they commented that it was not as easy as they thought it would be."

        {
            "text": "This collaborative approach continued right up until the final hornet nest was removed. Jackie is already planning the spring catch activities, with Tom who was invited back for the Dover and District Beekeepers Association\u2019s (DDBKA) January and February meetings. I was also particularly honoured to be asked to present the prizes at the Dover Beekeepers Honey Show and Jackie\u2019s certificate for achieving \u2018Master Beekeeper\u2019 status."

Credible reports without enough evidence are either asked for more detail or forwarded to British Beekeepers Association Yellow-Legged (Asian) Hornet Teams, who help monitor for yellow-legged hornets in the suspect area. You can find your local Yellow-Legged (Asian) Hornet Team Coordinator on the BBKA\u2019s website."
