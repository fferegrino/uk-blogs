            "text": "Back in 2018, we started by adding the highest-priority features to the site. The first was an interactive map so that users could see vacancies closer to home, in real time. The map also serves to highlight that over 80% of Civil Service jobs are based outside of London, in our regional towns and cities."

            "text": "We then expanded our range of cross-government information, to help users explore entry routes that suit their circumstances, get advice on reasonable adjustments and job sharing, and how to approach applications, assessments and interviews."

The site content is managed by many teams, or \u2018page owners\u2019 in different corners of the Civil Service, so it was important for the new design to be consistent but not uniform, allowing for personality and difference to shine through.\u00a0"

During the card sorting exercise, users were asked to group different information, that they might find on the site, into categories, in a way that made sense to them. This informed the menu structure you see today."

            "text": "The process for creating and editing site pages in WordPress was completely overhauled. Previously, page owners had to fit their content into 7 restrictive templates and follow a three-step publishing process. Now, page owners use bespoke blocks - a series of components (such as text, cards, images, tabs and accordions) with over 6 million potential combinations - to showcase their content. We\u2019ve also reduced the publishing process to just two steps."
        },

            "text": "Moving from templates to blocks was a manual process as each page had to be rebuilt using the new components. This took around 6 months and over 25 mini-projects, with page owners, providing workshops that included training, prototyping, content management, and design support.\u00a0"
