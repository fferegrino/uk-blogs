This created an earthquake of change in public administrations around the globe. And when you look under the bonnet, what enabled that brilliant multidisciplinary work was design."

            "text": "This opened the door for the UK\u2019s Civil Service to imagine how design might be deployed to make other types of services \u2026and policies. In 2014, Policy Lab was founded to create a space for the experimental design of policy, that made a break from the traditional desk-based policy analysis that had driven Whitehall in prior decades."

            "text": "Fundamentally, design is a practice. Of course, there is design theory and design research. But because it is about making \u2018things\u2019 - of all types - it is only really understood when it is used and practiced."
        },
        {
            "text": "And the practice is also systematic. You\u2019ll often hear public sector workers say (in common parlance) that they have \u2018designed\u2019 something, but they are speaking passively, meaning \u2018I worked on something\u2019. That is not what professional designers mean when they say they have designed something. Design to a designer is a systematic process and method for reducing uncertainty about the world and the people in it and responding to what they find to deliver a specific outcome. Consequently, we need to teach design as a technical skill."
