Nature, the environment and our society face a number of challenges including climate change and biodiversity loss. Did you know trees, woodlands and forests can be part of the solution? They provide unique habitats, they capture carbon to mitigate the impact of climate change, and they provide us with amazing places to enjoy.\u00a0"

For example, the UK\u2019s forests and woodlands remove around 18 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year [1]. Trees provide vital habitat for thousands of species \u2013 a single oak tree alone can support over 2,300 species [2]. If you look around, you\u2019ll likely see several items made from wood. Trees provide the raw material for everyday products, which store carbon throughout their lifetime. However, 81% of timber in the UK is imported [3], so we need to produce more of our own wood. Sustainable management of our woodlands will improve our timber security, conserve wildlife, help to tackle the climate emergency, improve well-being and more.\u00a0\u00a0"

Employers in the forestry sector also need ecologists to ensure sustainable practices that benefit biodiversity. Landscape architects design how woodlands fit in the landscape. Economists ensure optimal decision making. Scientists advance our understanding to grow resilient forests for an unknown future. Communications professionals share success stories to inspire involvement for people to make a difference. Roles also include recreation, marketing, design, project management and more.\u00a0"
