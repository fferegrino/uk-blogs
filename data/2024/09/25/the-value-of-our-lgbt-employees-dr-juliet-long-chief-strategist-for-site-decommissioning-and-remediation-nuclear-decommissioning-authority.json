And to me, the value in being openly LGBT+ in the workplace is not about broadcasting my own status; it\u2019s about being vocal and visible in a way that might help others who don\u2019t feel so comfortable or welcome, thereby creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for all."

Diversity of thought help inform and test our strategies and plans and the more representative our workforce can be of society then the better able we are to serve all parts of society \u2013 today and in the future.\u201d"
