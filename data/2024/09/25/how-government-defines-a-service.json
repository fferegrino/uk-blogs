The Top 75 Services programme champions services that take ownership of the users\u2019 experience across their full, end-to-end journey and all of the organisation\u2019s activities that support it. For example not just the process of applying for a new passport, but all the checks that happen behind the scenes, the producing of documents, and the sending and receiving of them too."

However, we\u2019ve learned that scope does not itself define a service. It\u2019s all about understanding the outcome that you want to deliver. A broader or narrower scope says more about the organisation\u2019s ambitions."
