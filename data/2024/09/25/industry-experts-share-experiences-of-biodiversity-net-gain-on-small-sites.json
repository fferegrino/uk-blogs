It applies only to \u2018small sites\u2019 as defined in The Small Sites (Statutory Biodiversity Metric) User Guide. In short, this means residential development with 1 to 9 dwellings on a site area less than 1 hectare. If the number of dwellings is unknown, the site area must be less than 0.5 hectares. Non-residential development is where the floor space created is less than 1,000 square metres or the total site area is less than 1 hectare. Refer to the SSM User Guide for further information.\u00a0"

We agreed that there was no need to pave over the land around the edges of the garages as originally intended. Instead, we decided to convert the paving into grassland with a few small trees. Following this, the team adapted the designs to add a set of trees and two areas of high-quality grassland habitat.\u00a0"

It clearly delivered an on-site gain of over 10% and fully complied with the principles of the mitigation hierarchy. The team used the Small Site Metric and available online digital tools to achieve this. This enabled them to fully meet the BNG requirements. They also delivered an improved design and submitted all necessary documentation to the LPA in a matter of hours. This prevented the client from experiencing any delays or onerous costs. The Small Site Metric saved time and money. It also allowed the client and developer to work together to find a solution that suited everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

This means any type of bare soil or unvegetated substrate, rather than just hardstanding. So, net gains can still be triggered. We also found the groundworks for the installation of the soakaway will cause loss of \u2018modified grassland habitats\u2019. However, the loss of this habitat was recorded as a temporary loss because the habitat would reach its pre-development state again within 2 years. The \u2018other neutral grassland\u2019 would be retained, and a 10% gain would be achieved with the planting of a tree adjacent to the caravan.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our experience using the SSM is that it is limited in its use. Small sites are by their very nature limited in size and therefore contain few areas to deliver BNG. Many sites that we use the SSM for contain a large proportion of garden space. Although private gardens cannot be legally secured, gardens can make a positive contribution to biodiversity. The SSM recognises this in its scoring of the value of gardens. However, it is not possible to use the SSM on all sites defined as \u2018small sites\u2019. For example, if European protected species are present or when a designated site such as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or a Special Area of Conservation is within 500m, it may be more appropriate to use the full metric.\u00a0\u00a0"
