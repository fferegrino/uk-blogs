When Defra receives applications to consider new bathing water locations, the criteria cover elements like usage, access and the location of amenities like toilets. It does not initially include water quality as the sites will not have been previously sampled for bathing water quality. But once a bathing water does become designated, it will be managed and expected to reach water quality standards fit enough to swim in \u2013 which is not the case for other water bodies.\u00a0\u00a0"

Once enough samples have been taken this season, each site will be given a bathing water classification ranging from \u2018Excellent\u2019 to \u2018Poor\u2019 to help you decide where to go swimming. It can often take years to build an accurate picture of the factors that might be affecting the bathing water quality at a site. In the meantime, if you are river swimming, consider the length of the river upstream of a new site and all the possible sources of pollutions along it like water company discharges, agricultural runoff, even septic tanks.\u00a0\u00a0"

Encouragingly, water companies have already approached us to discuss how to improve bathing water quality in designated rivers to a swimming standard despite the extra challenges present in these locations.\u00a0"

There is a lot of public interest to address concerns about water quality in these places and raise the bar from an ecological standard set to protect fish and wildlife up to a much higher level of quality needed for safe human use. Rivers have not been managed for recreation until recently. Rivers are usually monitored for their ecological health. However, this historic monitoring doesn\u2019t include measuring the bacteria that would indicate a possible risk to human health as the river wildlife is largely unaffected by these. The bacteria we measure for bathing water quality come from faeces, which in turn can be present in treated and untreated sewage effluent, runoff from livestock and farming or from private treatment systems like septic tanks.\u00a0 Bacteria and pathogens found in sewage and animal slurry pose the two biggest risks to human health. Because these factors do not typically affect wildlife, they haven\u2019t been subject to strict controls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

In fact, 99% of the bathing waters in Devon and Cornwall meet minimum water quality standards of 'Sufficient', with 96% meeting \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018Excellent\u2019 - and these counties have about a third of England's 451 bathing waters.\u00a0\u00a0 Like neighbouring Wessex, sampling in this area is very thorough and quick to flag any issues. Coastal bathing waters also have the advantage of natural disinfection via salt water as well as much greater dilution and we are able to issue pollution risk forecasts based on our knowledge about the tide, rainfall and wind.\u00a0\u00a0"
