Whether you prefer using spreadsheets, Lucid boards, a plain document, Figma, Jira, or even including it as a page on the code prototype. The key is to select a method that works well for your team and stakeholders. It is a good idea to discuss and agree on the best approach to ensure everyone is following all the relevant information."

Sometimes, you may choose to make a change to improve accessibility or decide to hold off on changes until more evidence is gathered. Both approaches are valid and should be documented accordingly."

        {
            "text": "Documenting design iterations in Figma is efficient as it eliminates the need to export designs to another tool. Everything stays within Figma, allowing you to add comments and insights directly on the design itself. This streamlines the process and ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible to the entire team."

As the same board contained everything\u2014screenshots, research insights, and the changes made from one version to another\u2014across all pages. Having all this information centralised on a single board made it easy to track progress and maintain a holistic view of the design journey."

            "text": "Documenting design iterations has proven to be invaluable in my work. Not just for keeping track of decisions, but for enhancing team collaboration and preserving the context of our designs. While the tools I\u2019ve used\u2014like Figma and Lucid\u2014have made this process more seamless. The key takeaway is that effective documentation should be tailored to your project\u2019s needs. Give it a try. You might be surprised at how much clarity and efficiency it brings to your design process."
