By leveraging real-time data and AI-powered analysis, our team of toxicologists are developing a deeper understanding of the air we breathe and its impact on our well-being. They have recently installed a state-of-the-art system for monitoring biological particles, such as pollen and fungal spores, marking a significant leap in environmental surveillance."

The light scattered by each particle as it moves through a laser is captured by 2 cameras to create a holographic image. These images provide detailed information on the size and shape of each particle."

            "text": "Historically, pollens and other biological particles/fungal spores are monitored using traps that sample air onto slides and/or sticky tape, which are then analysed under a microscope by experts able to identify and count different pollens/biological particles. This is a much slower process and results in data that is several days or even weeks old by the time it is available. Furthermore, count data is of lower resolution, generally per 24 hours at best."

The team are collaborating with these researchers to establish the first UK real-time pollen and fungal spore monitoring network. This will enable the consortium to build a much better picture of the changing pollen and fungal spore patterns across the country, identifying key sources and how our changing climate can impact aeroallergen patterns in the future."
