To reduce risk as much as possible, why not start small and scale up as you gain more confidence in each hypothesis? The authors of The Radical How are right, however, in cautioning against simply running lots of pilots. One problem is that pilots often test a whole policy solution rather than a specific hypothesis, which doesn\u2019t always give you the nuanced understanding you need. To rectify this, pilots or experiments should be explicitly designed to test the specific hypotheses upon which the success of the programme depends. It\u2019s also critical that, instead of waiting for a pilot to end before evaluating its success, we seek to learn throughout the pilot.\u00a0"

While these evaluations often provide invaluable insights, they usually come to light too late to influence the design of the programme. Conducting user testing will enable teams to iterate based on real-time feedback and correct any design features based on faulty assumptions. Departments should also monitor and evaluate the success of different local initiatives, to identify which solutions are working well, and which are not. By doing this, government can highlight, champion and encourage examples of good practice.\u00a0"

For example, if a fund has multiple \u2018bidding rounds\u2019, amending the guidance between rounds may help to improve the quality or quantity of future applications.\u00a0"

But there is also significant risk in tying an organisation down to an overly specified plan which has not been tested. This approach might not be appropriate for all organisation types, but local and devolved authorities should be given the space to develop their plans as more becomes known.\u00a0"
