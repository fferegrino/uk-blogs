Trustees have always been required to make decisions in a way that complies with their legal duties \u2013 for example, the duty to further the charity\u2019s purposes and act in its best interests. But the guidance (which we refer to in shorthand as CC27) pulled together 7 principles developed by the courts when they reviewed decisions made by charity trustees.\u00a0\u00a0"

So, on starting a programme of improving our guidance, our objectives were clear. We want trustees to be able to read and understand our guidance, and to put our guidance into practice. We want to help trustees improve their knowledge and in turn the governance of their charities. We want to support trustees to get it right.\u00a0\u00a0"

Making decisions is an experience that unites all trustees, whatever size your charity or sector you work in. It is critical to your charity, its governance and people.\u00a0\u00a0"
