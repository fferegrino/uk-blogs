In the third video and blog of the series, our Head of Customer Experience Gareth Jones talks about his role and the importance of customer service within RPA."

At RPA we\u2019re looking to become more customer-focussed in the way we offer and administrate the products and services we deliver. My role is to act as a catalyst in instilling a customer experience ethos across RPA that eventually becomes embedded into everything we do."

            "text": "I joined RPA in April this year, and it's fair to say that no two days have been the same. My immediate focus is on getting some solid customer experience foundation stones in place. These include understanding in more detail who our customers are and how they interact with us, as well as mapping the core journeys customers go through and identifying improvement opportunities. I have also started to look at our overall customer strategy and review how we communicate with our customers - from written letters to handy \u2018how to\u2019 YouTube content \u2013 as well as working out how we measure our performance from the customers' perspective."
        },
        {
            "text": "Moving forward, the role will evolve. I see it becoming much more about listening to the voice of our customers, representing those voices in decision-making and ensuring our solutions deliver in a way that\u2019s easy to understand, cuts through bureaucracy and has a positive impact on our customers. The ultimate goal is to embed a customer culture within RPA\u2019s DNA."

        {
            "text": "Before this role I was head of customer experience at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, but most of my career has been spent working in customer experience functions within the Financial Services industry. I live on the Monmouthshire/Gloucestershire border and have children at secondary school. I was brought up in rural communities where my father was an agricultural manager for one of the big high street banks."

I also enjoy being outdoors and have completed the Three Peaks Challenge and have walked the length of Hadrian\u2019s Wall in the past. I\u2019m currently slowly working my way through climbing the top 100 highest peaks in Wales."
