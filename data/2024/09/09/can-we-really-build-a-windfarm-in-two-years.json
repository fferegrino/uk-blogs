To support making the most effective interventions, it is essential that the \u2018problem\u2019 is properly defined. The facts about perceived delays in the planning/consenting stage of OWF deployment need to be set in the context of the time taken for all stages, how those have changed over time, and therefore where there is most potential for reducing delay."
