My university experience was dynamic, providing a broad understanding of business principles and allowing me to delve into specific areas like Marketing Communications and Employment Law. As I neared the end of my studies, I was eager to apply this knowledge in a meaningful public sector career, especially after completing a placement year with City Year, an education charity focused on addressing educational inequality in schools."

The prospect of working in a challenging environment where I could make a tangible impact on public policy was incredibly appealing. With my background in Business and Management, and a strong interest in IT and HR, I felt confident in my skills and motivation to succeed."

This was initially a significant disappointment, as I had set my sights on this goal for some time. Not achieving it made me question my suitability for a career in the Civil Service. Yet, as is often the case, when one door closes, another opens."

This opportunity came as a surprise but a welcome one. The SDIP is designed to give students and recent graduates from diverse backgrounds the chance to gain valuable experience within the Civil Service. I was thrilled to accept the offer and saw it as a second chance to prove my potential."

            "text": "My time in the Internal Engagement team was an incredible experience. As a newcomer to the professional world, I was a bit nervous, but the team were welcoming and supportive. I quickly found my footing and began contributing to various projects. One of my primary duties was assisting in the planning and execution of staff communications, including the weekly All-Staff meeting. This online event provided a summary of news and team updates, with presentations from various speakers. There were countless moments of self-doubt, but rather than giving up, I kept pushing forward. After delivering a successful All-Staff meeting, I realised that I was capable of more than I had imagined. Every new challenge became an opportunity rather than an obstacle."

I was then assigned to the HR Casework team after expressing my interest in that area. This transition marked a significant shift in my role, from a focus on communications and marketing to a more specialised area of HR. The HR Casework team handles sensitive and complex staffing issues, providing advice and support to managers and staff across OPSS."

I was involved in handling employee relations cases, advising on HR policies, and ensuring that all HR policies and procedures were followed correctly. The experience enhanced my HR knowledge and equipped me with practical skills that I still apply in my current role as a Workplace Adjustments Lead and Casework Support Officer. I also developed greater confidence in handling challenging situations and making impactful decisions that affect individuals\u2019 careers."
