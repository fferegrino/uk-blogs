            "text": "The marine environment is ever-evolving, meaning fisheries science must adapt to change. The most obvious change in the marine environment is the human expansion of offshore wind (OSW) energy. The rate of development is accelerating both nationally and internationally, and it is important that science can keep pace. Evidence of the ecological impacts of OSW developments on fisheries species at an individual, populations and stock level are currently limited. Even less is known about the cumulative impacts of OSW and developing new technologies, such as floating OSW. \u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "To address these knowledge gaps, it is important that there is access to baseline fisheries data and that monitoring of fisheries resources is occurring at an appropriate scale, within and around the OSW sites prior to and during construction and their operation. However, traditional fisheries monitoring techniques such as trawl surveys are often not compatible with OSW areas. This means new monitoring techniques should be trialled, which is a big challenge.\u00a0"

            "text": "We also focus on challenges regarding the rapid development of advanced scientific techniques and modern statistical packages, which have provided new tools for fisheries scientists. For example, genomics has provided a unique insight into fish demographics; opening paths to assess the structure of populations both in the immediate term but also over evolutionary timescales, allowing us to predict how climate change may impact fish populations in the future. One of the crucial issues is how we sensibly integrate current and long-term population structure information within existing advice frameworks for helping to achieve sustainable fisheries.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Another focus is the use of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The current approach has generally improved the state of managed fisheries, however a holistic approach that considers the entire ecosystem makes sense when managing fish stocks due to predation and competition for resources.\u00a0 In this paper, we have pioneered a new integrated indicator to assess whether individual stocks are depleted. This will allow fisheries managers to set an acceptable level of risk in collaboration with stakeholders alongside the scientific process.\u00a0"

However, we are actively looking at incorporating new technologies into research and monitoring, for example, the joining of different methods to collect real time data for different life-stages is an area under development (e.g. AI-assisted plankton imaging, juvenile surveys as well as adults, applying traditional and remote methods for data collection).\u00a0 Cefas\u2019 Offshore and Marine Renewable Energy (OMRE) group meets regularly and helps us keep up to date with ongoing research across various topics associated with OSW.\u00a0 \u00a0"

Through engagement with fishers, we can help to better understand changes in perception of OSW over time; there is potential for perception to change with increased longer-term evidence. Engagement with stakeholders is crucial to understand concerns, informing targeted data collection to provide the evidence needed to determine whether mitigation is needed. The value of anecdotal, local knowledge from fishers should not be underestimated as it provides useful indications of fish distribution and abundance in response to OSW developments, however, this information can only be obtained with clear communication. Good relationships with the fishing industry and stakeholders creates the potential for collaborative research and monitoring - a great example of this would be the Westermost Rough wind farm which became operational in May 2015 and the Holderness Fishing Industry Group.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0"
