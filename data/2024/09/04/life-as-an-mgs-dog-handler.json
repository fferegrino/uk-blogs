[Crown Copyright / MOD 2024]When patrolling sites, the questions I\u2019m most frequently asked are \u2018Does he bite?\u2019 and \u2018Can I stroke him?\u2019. However, because Wraith is a military working patrol dog, he is trained to bite if required to help protect MOD sites and staff. Because of this, it would be inappropriate to allow people to stroke him while he is on duty, as he has a very important job to do."
