This update has been written to support site managers and landowners to improve the condition of sand dunes across the UK and protect the rare and often unique species that have adapted to live in sand.\u00a0"

            "text": "The updated edition draws upon the learnings from the Dynamic Dunescapes project by including 35 instructive case studies written by dedicated local site managers and others directly involved with the project. The case studies capture the project\u2019s experiences of using novel and adaptive management approaches and shares best practise to benefit others involved in dune management.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

It has delivered conservation work at scale and undertaken engagement work that has both supported the conservation work as well as made a wider contribution to tackling inequalities. Project partners are Natural England, Plantlife, National Trust, Natural Resources Wales, Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and Cumbria Wildlife Trust. The project budget of \u00a310 million includes funding from two major funders, The National Lottery Heritage Fund and the EU LIFE Programme, alongside partner and in-kind contributions.\u00a0"

Coastal dune systems are still under threat from pressures such as over-stabilisation, development and climate change, and require management and restoration to reverse this decline.\u00a0"

            "text": "The approach to dune management has changed over the decades as ecologists have carried out research and learnt more. There is now recognition that in order for dunes to be healthy, self-sustaining, and biodiverse they must be dynamic, and management is now aimed at supporting these natural processes and encouraging mobility of sand in the dunes. However, occasionally dune stabilisation may still be relevant in some locations.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Naturally functioning, dynamic sand dune systems are among the most natural remaining habitat types in the UK.\u00a0 Dunes are wild, iconic landscapes that are universally recognisable. They are unique habitats that support more than 70 nationally rare or red-data book species and are a refuge for many lowland species lost elsewhere. They are also important to our physical and psychological wellbeing, recreation, leisure and learning.\u00a0"

The new edition handbook also recognises regional variations in habitat type including a new section on machair \u2013 a rare type of habitat unique to the exposed northwest coasts of Scotland and Ireland that is renowned for its abundant diversity of flora and fauna."
