            "text": "Our Enabling Technologies Programme (ETP) is designed to increase the readiness of high-potential technologies. One of the most captivating technologies being used and developed by our project partners is the laser. Powerful, accurate and highly versatile, lasers are found in a wide range of devices we use every day and enable developments in areas ranging from modern medicine to military and space applications."

In conjunction with the\u00a0Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), ETP Call 2 invited applications for funding under the theme \u201cScience Instruments\u201d. Naturally, several of the successful projects are making use of laser technology for space science.The Glasgow-based Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics \u00a0(ETP2-006) is due to complete \u201cGlobal Lidar Altimetry Mission: GLAMIS\u201d (UAV demonstrator phase) by November 2024 in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh."

            "text": "Much like the traditional sonar methods used underwater, LiDAR - laser imaging (or light), detection, and ranging \u2013 uses lasers by firing them at a surface and measuring how long it takes for the signal to be returned. Quantum technology has improved LiDAR to allow scientists to develop sensitive and highly efficient instruments suitable for space applications. GLAMIS draws from this technology to develop a low SWaP light detection and ranging method (LiDAR) instrument that can be mounted onto uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones and satellites, to support Earth observation and Earth sciences."

            "text": "Testing GLAMIS has not been easy; hindered by the need for a full moon on a cloudless night (no mean feat in Scotland!), the team at Fraunhofer had to wait several months to fly a UAV."

ETP2-021 supports MDA Space and Robotics in their ongoing project, \u201cStructured light for Robotics guidance, InsPection and Exploration (STRIPE)\u201d. Due for completion in early 2025, the team at MDA is working to develop a novel laser sensor that will enable even the most difficult of space missions by supporting complex vision-based missions in poor illumination conditions, promising extensive commercial and research opportunities."

ETP2-022, \u201cQuantum magnetometry for Space Weather\u201d, aims to design and manufacture a highly stabilised laser which can be used in low Earth orbit to support space weather measurement."
