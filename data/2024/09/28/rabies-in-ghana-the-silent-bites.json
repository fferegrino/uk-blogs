She was being consoled by her colleagues. But why? Sadly, she had been informed about the daughter of a close relative, who has just passed away. The daughter had been bitten by a dog suspected of rabies. She had initially reported that she was suffering from a bad headache and could not drink water or eat food. Later, she began to vomit and foam at the mouth."

He is a happy man today because he is saving Ghs500, (approximately \u00a324), participating in UK supported dog vaccination. Five people from his household have been saved from direct possible rabies virus exposure. With the big picture in mind, Ghana could be saving, within these 60 days, Ghs75,000, (approximately \u00a33,600), in direct vaccination cost investment.
