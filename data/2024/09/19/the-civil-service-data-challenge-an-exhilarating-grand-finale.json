Competitors are invited to submit data-led project ideas or join a team, to offer a solution to a technical issue or societal challenge. The best idea will receive \u00a350,000-worth of technical support and the backing of senior leaders, pushing it down the road towards implementation; and every participant will gain new skills, experiences and contacts."
