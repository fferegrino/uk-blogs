When a bathing water is designated, it means it\u2019s monitored according to bathing water regulations. Designated bathing waters are sampled by the Environment Agency during the bathing water season which runs from May to the end of September, when most bathers are expected there. Importantly, designation also means that information is provided to the public to help inform decisions on where and when to bathe.\u00a0\u00a0"

Annual classifications are based on up to four years' worth of data. This helps you understand what water quality is typically like and means you can compare between sites as well.\u00a0"

From May to the end of September, more than 7,000 water samples will be taken by the Environment Agency and the results fed into Swimfo. Water samples taken from designated bathing waters are sent off to the Environment Agency\u2019s lab and tested for two types of bacteria, E coli and intestinal enterococci which will show if there is any faecal matter in the water. The most common sources of faecal matter are from certain types of livestock, urban drainage and sewage, but it can also come from birds, wildlife and pets.\u00a0"

Water users may be at a higher risk of becoming ill when using a bathing water at this time.\u00a0"

These places are managed for the purpose of protecting fish and wildlife, not people, so don\u2019t need to achieve bathing water bacterial standards. It\u2019s important to recognise that health risks from using these locations may be higher than at designated bathing waters. Rivers are closer to sources of bacteria than the sea, and don\u2019t have the benefit of dilution that occurs by the time bacteria reach the sea.\u00a0"

Their messages are clear: vigilance can save lives, and water-related accidents can be avoided by knowing how to stay safe. The Environment Agency, which manages many locks, weirs and bridges across England, wants people to remember the hazards under the water in rivers while spending time with friends and family. People should not jump or dive into water and stay away from weirs, locks and pipes. There can be unseen hazards in the water, and cold-water shock can affect even strong swimmers on warm days. If you\u2019re swimming in waters with boats, keep a look out for boat traffic, stay vigilant, and take steps to enhance your visibility.\u00a0"
