The project is funded by HM Government\u2019s Shared Outcomes Fund. It is a \u00a34.8m, 5-year, programme delivered in partnership with The Tree Council, Natural England, Defra, and five local authorities. My day-to-day role ranges from planning new experimental planting schemes, collaborative projects within the county, conducting site visits, speaking to the community and the various project partners, to monitoring and evaluating our pilots."

It has provided me with the opportunity to be able to experiment and try out novel approaches in tree planting and management, with the aim of increasing our tree cover across the county. We\u2019ve now reached the stage where, excitingly, we can start sharing the results of some of our pilots."

            "text": "Stresses on newly planted urban trees can result in low survival rates, preventing these trees from providing their potential ecosystem services, and creating the perception that planting in such locations is unreliable and costly. There are many benefits for both people and nature that urban trees provide, which is why experimentation and new approaches need to be explored more often."

The aim is to quickly reconstruct indigenous woodlands on deforested land or areas with degraded soils. The method has been successfully utilised in Asia for over 50 years for the purpose of environmental conservation, water retention, and protection against natural hazards."

            "text": "Initially, the total cost to plant a plot using the Miyawaki method was higher compared to the comparison plots. This is because it\u2019s a more resource heavy process, requiring around three times the number of trees to be planted. However, our findings so far show a significantly greater survival rate in the Miyawaki plots (an average of 79%) compared to the comparison plots (47%). This was achieved during a drought in summer 2022."

        {
            "text": "The average median cost of the Miyawaki method was \u00a310 per survived tree, against \u00a350 for standard practice planting methods. This is because a much higher proportion of the planted trees in the Miyawaki plots survived, compared to the control plots. Results have also shown much less cost variability per surviving tree in the Miyawaki plots, suggesting it\u2019s easier to predict how much it will cost to get a number of trees surviving for the first three years using the Miyawaki method than typical techniques."

        {
            "text": "In addition to this, growth rates have been higher across the Miyawaki plots, after three and a half years the trees generally resemble a dense thicket of early successional woodland, in fact some of the biggest trees are about 15 feet tall. All species are thriving, some are faster growing than the others, many are flowering and producing seed already, and wildlife is making a home within the plot. Most of the surviving trees in the comparison areas are also doing well, but they tended to be significantly smaller than those in the Miyawaki plots, and some were also vandalised."

Across Asia, large areas planted using the Miyawaki method are 50 years old and are healthy woodlands with mixed canopy levels.\u00a0Even if our small plots provide only 3 or 4 mature trees eventually, in the meantime they will have provided an instant impact feature with benefits for biodiversity and local people.\u00a0\u00a0"
