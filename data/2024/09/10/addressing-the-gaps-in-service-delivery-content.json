As part of this, we realised that we needed to create a prioritisation tool to work out where to start making changes that would have the biggest impact on our users to focus our efforts."

            "text": "We started by trying to define the scope of service delivery content and creating a topic based structure to place all the existing products and services in to get a better view of what our content was talking about at a higher level. To help us understand what topics we should group content around, we ran a top tasks exercise where we presented a list of tasks to our users and asked them to identify their top 5. We then followed up with targeted user research to know more about how people currently use our content and some of the biggest challenges they face when trying to deliver services. Based on what we learned, we decided to map our products and services across the service delivery lifecycle and highlighted themes we knew were important from our research, ranging from approaches to transforming services, through to delivery practices and performance measurement."

            "text": "Once we had our structure, we then layered all our existing products and services onto it, and this helped us clearly see where the gaps were in what we offer. For example, we have a lot of guidance in the Service Manual about delivery approaches (like this page on how to run in-depth user research interviews), but little information on service transformation as a whole and the conditions that are needed to enable it."

            "text": "However, although this map helped us have a clear understanding of how all our content could be grouped, we still had an overwhelming landscape to narrow down.

We\u2019ve since turned this process into an internal tool we are calling \u2018the good practice framework\u2019."

        {
            "text": "We applied a risk and impact lens to all of our topic areas identified in the scoping exercise to ask ourselves which of those areas were strategically important and have the largest potential for change. We answered questions such as \u2018what type of change is it\u2019 to understand its risk profile and questioned whether there was a clear purpose to know what impact it was or was not having. This helped us understand where the biggest scope for change was and how controversial that change might be."

        {
            "text": "Once we narrowed the topics down to the areas that came out as high priority against our risk and impact questions, we then took the individual pieces of content that we had mapped to those topics and applied questions on confidence and effort. This helped us understand how confident we were that a change is needed based on who\u2019s telling us about it and what we know about the subject, as well as the size and scope of the change required. It also helped us know if something was or was not currently good practice."

We\u2019ve learned that different types of services have individual nuances as to how they are managed, and whilst the high level principles in the Service Standard apply to all services, we don't have specific guidance for teams on how this might be applied to other service types. This has been a long term issue for assurance teams, and acknowledged by a range of cross-government communities."

We will be working closely with this community to learn more about the challenges, understand what good practice already exists and share guidance when we know more."
