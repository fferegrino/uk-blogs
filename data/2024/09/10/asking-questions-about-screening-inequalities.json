We heard from a range of people including screening staff, clinicians, third sector representatives, public health professionals, commissioners, societies and Royal Colleges, and members of the public."

        {
            "text": "We know inequalities of access and outcomes in health and healthcare are longstanding and important issues. There is plenty of literature relating to inequalities in, and barriers to, screening. However, there is very little published evidence on proven interventions that reduce inequalities or increase uptake in underserved groups. We wanted to see if we could shed some light on the gaps that need filling."

This was followed by \u2018learning disability\u2019 and \u2018ethnicity\u2019 for YPA programmes, and \u2018ethnicity\u2019 and \u2018cultural or religious beliefs\u2019 for ANNB programmes."
