For those susceptible, it can increase the risk of developing serious lung and airway infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia or can make existing conditions worse. Flu spreads easily and can lead to hospitalisation - in some cases, even death. The flu virus is constantly evolving, which is why getting vaccinated each year is vital."

The vaccines do not prevent flu that well in babies under 6 months, so are not recommended. This is why it is so important that pregnant women have the vaccination \u2013 they will pass on some immunity to their baby, protecting them during the early months of their life. The flu vaccine can be given at any stage of your pregnancy, but it\u2019s best to get vaccinated as soon as you can."

Speak to your GP practice if you have not been contacted, but think you are eligible. Online and telephone booking opens on 23 September, and appointments are available for eligible adults from 3 October. If you are pregnant you can have the vaccine now: speak to your GP practice, midwife or pharmacist."

            "text": "For adults, the flu vaccine is administered as an injection. Children are typically offered a nasal spray, which is quick and painless. The vaccine is updated each year to combat the most prevalent strains of the virus, and protection from the vaccine also goes down with time, so even if you were vaccinated last year, it's essential to get a new jab for the 2024 season."

            "text": "Flu vaccines have an excellent safety record. While some people may experience mild side effects from the injection such as a sore arm or slight fever, these generally don\u2019t last long and are far less severe than flu itself.\u00a0 Side effects of the nasal vaccine may commonly include a runny or blocked nose, headache, tiredness and some loss of appetite."
