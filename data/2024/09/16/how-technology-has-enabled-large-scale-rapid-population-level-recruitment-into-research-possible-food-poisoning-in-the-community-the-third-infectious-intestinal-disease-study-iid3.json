Practices have been able to quickly and easily send text message invitations to a large proportion of their patient population (~80%). In the first three months of recruitment an estimated 250,000 text messages were sent. We were able to achieve this through automated patient search, and batch text message invitation software, which interfaces with the practice\u2019s computerised medical record system. The automated search allowed screening to be simpler and quicker (to exclude patients aged under 18, and those with incapacity to consent), so that practice staff don\u2019t need to undertake this task manually."
