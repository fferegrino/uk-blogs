Tom acted to bring his slurry storage into compliance with the Silage, Slurry and Fuel Oil regulations and to help meet the requirements for Farming Rules for Water. This meant that he had enough storage to see him through winter and could comply with the requirements for spreading manures and fertilisers to meet soil and crop need only.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Tom found himself in a situation many farmers will be familiar with. Too much slurry and too little storage. Ultimately, what this ends up with is having to venture out and spread slurry on fields when it is not required by soil or crop. In general terms, there is no soil or crop need for nutrients during the autumn and winter months (though there are some exceptions). There are a lot of issues with spreading at this time of year:\u00a0"

Understanding how much rainfall you receive and rectifying issues with drainage and guttering can go a long way to reducing the volume of slurry you collect. As Tom notes, he was able to roof existing buildings with grant funding, meaning a lot of improvements made for little or no outlay, and a great deal of benefit to his storage capacity.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is a significant buffer for his current requirements and assurance that he won\u2019t have to revisit slurry storage on his farm for many years to come. Tom\u2019s slurry lagoon was a more significant financial investment but he is now reaping the benefits by buying in much less bagged fertiliser. As he mentions in the video, he is growing a lot more grass by applying slurry to his land at the right time. \u00a0"
