            "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019m a Senior Software Engineer at the Student Loans Company (SLC), and my main focus is on developing systems that allow students to apply for student finance online. I also work on systems that help our staff process these applications efficiently. It\u2019s really rewarding work as you are helping people realise their dream of furthering their education."

        },
        {
            "text": "Of course! My journey with SLC began while I was still at university. I worked night shifts at SLC doing data entry and studied for a Foundation Degree in Computer Science during the day. After completing my degree, I joined the Desktop Support Team and continued my studies part-time at the Open University, eventually earning a BSc (Hons)\u00a0. A turning point for me was completing a module on Java Development, which I really enjoyed. This experience steered me towards programming and software engineering, leading me to apply for a Software Engineering position within the company after my graduation. The SLC was the ideal place to work while I gained my education and was a great environment for gaining work experience."

        },
        {
            "text": "I love working in technology because it\u2019s such a fast-moving industry. There\u2019s always something new to learn\u2014new languages, frameworks, and ways of thinking about problem-solving. Coding allows me to be creative when problem solving, and I feel a great sense of accomplishment when a project is finished, and I see it being used and making a difference."

        {
            "text": "Is that the best thing about your current role?"
        },
        {
            "text": "It\u2019s great to see my work being used in real life and making a difference, butI also really enjoy working with a team of experienced developers. Our team is very collaborative, and we are always learning new skills and technologies from each other. I would say my team is the best thing about my current role! Also, the industry can be very male dominated, but SLC is a fantastic equal opportunities employer. There are many women in senior and management positions within the Technology Group where I work, which gives me confidence in my own career progression."

            "text": "Finally, this year\u2019s National Coding Week theme is AI. What do you think about AI?"
        },
        {
            "text": "That\u2019s a good question. Personally, I think AI will revolutionise the coding landscape through helping with things like automated code generation, bug detection and fixes, and testing security. This will assist developers, creating efficiencies and increasing capability. It\u2019s exciting to see where this technology will go. \u00a0"
