I started my role in April this year, so I\u2019ve been busy getting to know the teams across RPA and Defra. I\u2019ve also been learning about the processes and services we offer to our customers. Part of my role has been establishing the customer insight team which has included recruitment, training and future planning. \u00a0"

We\u2019ll play a crucial role in helping RPA understand our customers better, as well as identifying new opportunities to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and satisfaction. We\u2019ve already implemented several initiatives, such as a customer satisfaction survey and other surveys that measure some of the specific interactions that customers have with us.\u00a0\u00a0"

On one day I could be working from my desk looking at survey results and analysing information, then attending agricultural shows and farms the next, stepping into their shoes and learning about the fantastic work they do. I absolutely love hearing from and speaking with customers. I don\u2019t have a farming or agricultural background, so hearing from the\u00a0experts and really seeing their passion for what they do is the best part of my role.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

My last role was at Companies House - the UK\u2019s Register of Companies and the Register of Overseas entities - as the Head of Customer Service. I was responsible for leading the customer service strategy, ensuring it reflected customer needs, best practice and was embedded across all services. Before joining the Civil Service, I worked in the private sector and my whole career has been working with and serving customers.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

I enjoy anything creative \u2013 I paint quite a lot and enjoy finding new projects to complete. I also love attending\u00a0concerts which comes from a passion for music and dance. I grew up learning Latin American dancing and competed on various stages across the world."

I spent most of my life there until I moved back to Newport seven years ago. It makes commuting across the bridge much easier as I\u2019m very close to the border. Although I\u2019m Welsh, most of my family are English, so rugby days can be very interesting!\u00a0\u00a0"
