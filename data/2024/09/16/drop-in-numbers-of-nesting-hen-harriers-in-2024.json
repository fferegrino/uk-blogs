Possible explanations for the decline in numbers this year include poor weather in spring 2024, and low numbers of small mammals and birds, which the harriers feed on. The numbers of chicks fledged per successful nest was down on last year (3.2 compared to 3.9), suggesting that parent birds may have been finding it harder to feed their chicks.\u00a0\u00a0"
