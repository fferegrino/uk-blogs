Typically, a PCR test is used to detect a small number of these mutations to differentiate between clades, such as Clade I and Clade II mpox. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) can provide more genetic information to use to distinguish between the sub-clades, and as WGS is not impacted by small changes and so continues to work. Additionally, publicly sharing genome data can help to understand the transmission and spread of the virus in affected areas, as well as help research into transmissibility, severity, or vaccine efficacy."
