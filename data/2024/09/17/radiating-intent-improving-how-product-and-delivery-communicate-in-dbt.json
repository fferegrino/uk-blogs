Getting everyone in a room together, on an equal level, allowed us to strengthen connections with our colleagues. This is a vital part of building resilient teams. It also gave us the time to put our heads together on some key issues. \u00a0"

We\u00a0 generated and triaged ideas in small groups, before feeding back to the main session and sorting our thoughts."

We also need users to be able to hear about the changes we are making. Finally, we improve how others see us by being open and celebrating our success. This increases the pace of further delivery."

By working transparently and openly in formal and informal networks, we create the space to both illustrate our intent and create collaboratively. For example, sharing design history to show the product journey, and the reasoning behind iterative changes, rather than simply telling."

They move swiftly and seamlessly through the department\u2019s internal structures to get products delivered. They helped us see that sometimes a tightly drafted memo is more effective than weeks of show and tells or engagement workshops."

To be effective Delivery and Product Managers we need to know how to engage with our stakeholders. Working through this with the team really made me realise what I need to do in my role as a leader.\u00a0 I must ensure that they all have the confidence and skills to put themselves in the right room at the right time to get things done."

We use different techniques to work in the open and receive feedback on what we are delivering. These include Show and Tells, where we share the work done over the previous fortnight, and weeknotes, where team members publish updates on their work. Ideally, they create a dialogue between the team and their colleagues. This allows for healthy feedback and even generates new ideas."

Show and tells, for example, can now be truly open. We are in a department with users based in countries all over the world. Being able to host everyone in a virtual room has allowed us to gain much broader perspectives on our work."

For me, it\u2019s about ensuring the teams feel comfortable and safe to try out new ideas.\u00a0 These can lead to improvements, both within our structure and more widely.\u00a0 Teams might want to consolidate their show and tells to reach a broader group of stakeholders, or travel to other offices to share their work in the open."

It allowed them to refocus on their goals. Stepping back and looking at how we are doing is always valuable, especially if we find that if something isn\u2019t working, we can just change it."
