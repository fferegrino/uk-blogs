In this post, we highlight how the project will improve understanding of marine natural capital assets, uses, values and benefits. It will also assess the trade-offs and synergies across ecosystem services provision in support of sustainable marine management in England."

            "text": "Marine natural capital assets such as species, habitats, natural processes and functions, underpin the provision of vital goods and services that support the economy and human well-being. The flows of ecosystem services and goods from natural capital assets (along with other forms of capital e.g., financial capital) enable benefits to be generated for our economy, society and the environment (Figure 1)."

            "text": "In England, marine and coastal environments are recognised as providing a range of benefits such as the provision of food, energy, clean water, wildlife, recreation, enjoyment of the natural environment and many more. However, pollution, the unsustainable use of coastal and marine resources, biodiversity loss and climate change can adversely affect marine natural capital and degrade ecosystem services and benefits. A natural capital approach therefore allows us to consider the often-complex relationship between nature (natural assets), the ecosystem services they support, and the benefits derived from them."

        {
            "text": "To make informed choices around how to protect and manage the marine environment, decision-makers require evidence and tools that enable them to understand the full range of goods and services provided by our marine environment in a more holistic way. These tools need to be capable of understanding how decisions over use of the marine environment impact marine natural capital, especially with respect to the potential losses, gains and trade-offs in ecosystem services and benefits, and the broader impacts to society and nature."

The project spans catchment to coast, nearshore and to offshore marine environments in English waters, and takes an integrated approach in combining environmental, social and economic considerations into a natural capital framework."

It also aims to provide more holistic understanding of the benefits and complex trade-offs involved in managing our marine environment, with the aim of supporting the sustainable use of coastal and marine environments."
