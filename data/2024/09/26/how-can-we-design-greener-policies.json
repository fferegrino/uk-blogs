Last year, I was part of a small group of service designers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), who took up this challenge by drafting a set of \u2018greener service principles\u2019.\u00a0"

You can read more about the planning and outputs from the Greener Services hack day on the Defra Digital blog, and explore the Greener Service Principles online."

They set the intended course of action to achieve an objective, so if we\u2019re aiming for greener services, we must start by designing greener policies. In this blog post, I\u2019ll summarise my talk based on my experience working as a service designer in the UK\u2019s cross-government Policy Lab team before joining Defra, where I now work.\u00a0 "

            "text": "Delivery of the mission and priorities is supported by existing legislation and guidelines which hold government to account and support policymaking. In 2023, the UK Government published its Environmental principles policy statement, a set of guidelines for ministers and policymakers with similar aspirations to the greener service principles. They are underpinned by the Environment Act 2021, which made the UK the first government in the world to put its environmental targets into law. This legislation in turn supports delivery of the UK\u2019s 25 Year Environment Plan (2018) and the Environment Improvement Plan (2023), which are reported on annually. A dashboard is also being developed to report on indicators describing environmental change in relation to the legislation."

Each year at the COP, agreements on aspects of climate policy are adopted by countries attending, creating a shared starting point for national policymaking. The COP agreements are now enhanced by the UN\u2019s recent Pact for the Future, adopted by 143 nations this month (including the UK), agreeing actions towards a safer, more peaceful, sustainable and inclusive world for future generations."

In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to add a new chapter to its constitution dedicated to the Andean philosophy of \u2018Sumak Kawsay\u2019 (harmonious living with oneself, others, and nature), and recognising \u2018Pachamama\u2019 (Mother Earth) as a legal entity.\u00a0"

            "text": "An example of contemporary environmental legislation reflecting indigenous cultures' wisdom without being directly linked to it is the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act 2015 in Wales. The Act explicitly permits all Welsh Government policies to improve the social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being of current and future generations and has its own independent Commissioner for Future Generations to ensure that work happens. The pioneering legislation took ten years of iterative development - listen to Jane Davidson explain the creation of the Act."

Policy teams have learned that qualitative methods like user research and ethnography allow us to deeply understand the people we are designing for, and methods like systems thinking and futures thinking help us understand and design for complexity and different possible futures.\u00a0"

            "text": "However, the scale and urgency of environmental issues, combined with the lack of \u2018win-win\u2019 solutions and current financial constraints, can only be resolved by genuinely opening up the policymaking process. This means going beyond the conventional consultation process, and trusting citizens by considering them as an integral part of our policymaking team. The recent Citizens\u2019 White Paper published by Demos and Involve explains this in its opening chapter:"

            "text": "The good news is that European countries, including the UK adopted the UNECE agreement on this approach in 1998, and there are already tried and tested methods happening across the world that increase citizen participation in both national and local governments, including co-design, citizens\u2019 assemblies, collective intelligence and legislative theatre. Indeed our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer described the benefits to participants at the Camden Climate Crisis Citizens\u2019 Assembly in 2019. Many of the innovative methods we already use - user research, ethnography, systems thinking, futures thinking - can be adapted and combined with more participatory methods to open them up to wider participation. For example Policy Lab\u2019s project with Defra and the Welsh Government to co-design ideas for a new Fisheries Management Plan for Seabass with fishers."

The big, complex policy issues we face today - including the climate crisis - impact each of us differently, so how we choose to design policy has the potential to either polarise communities or unite them.\u00a0"

These are scenarios that Lou Downe describes in their book \u2018Good Services\u2019 (2020) that tend to benefit from human interaction. I\u2019d also add that human interaction can be critical for building trust where trust is low to start with."
        },
        {
            "text": "These scenarios are increasingly true for services that are helping deliver policies intended to transition whole sectors of the economy to low carbon, regenerative futures. For example, in research with advisers who work with farmers to adopt more nature-friendly farming, we heard that visiting farmers was critical to delivering a trusted service, compared to delivering their advice purely by phone, video call, letter or signposting to online guidance."

            "text": "Beyond the scope of service design, it\u2019s important to consider the portfolio of policy interventions that can be combined to deliver outcomes. During my time at Policy Lab, we often used the Government styles of action framework to invite policymakers to think more widely about how they might deliver their policy objectives. On reflection, this framework is also useful to service designers working with policymakers to translate policy objectives into delivery, where delivery is understood as a system of interventions, not a service alone."
