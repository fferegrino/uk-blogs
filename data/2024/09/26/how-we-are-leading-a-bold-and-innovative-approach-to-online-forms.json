We already know that hundreds of paper (document based) forms are published on GOV.UK which handle around 14 million transactions per year. Defra needs to end its ongoing reliance on paper-based forms, as processes involving paper-based forms are costly and there are accessibility issues for users who rely on technology such as screen readers to access content.\u00a0"

Policy and operational teams routinely engage with our Digital, Data, Technology and Security (DDTS) colleagues to deliver new digital services to replace forms, but this can be costly, time-consuming and often unnecessary for simple processes.

Using this approach to delivering a common capability also helps us to save time and money so that we can react quickly to urgent changes in legislation or disease outbreaks that require interaction with members of the public."

There\u2019s also the issue of additional functionality. When we audited all of Defra\u2019s 579 paper forms in 2023, we classified them for complexity and functionality."

Whilst Defra Forms is working to meet requirements for new online forms, in response to changing legislation for example, we are also committed to reducing the number of existing paper (document) based forms by at least 20% by 2025 - so we need to be able to transform this backlog of forms quickly."
