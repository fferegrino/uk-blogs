The ocean, which absorbs around 90% of this excess heat, is also experiencing significant warming (Fig 1). This year, due to a combination of long-term climate change and short-term climate variability due to \u00a0El Ni\u00f1o, global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) hit record highs. Decades of sustained ocean warming have led to an increase in both the frequency and severity of marine heatwaves\u2014periods of unusually high sea temperatures for 5 days or more that can have devastating effects on marine biodiversity."

In June 2023, the seas around the UK experienced a marine heatwave, with sea surface temperatures reaching their highest levels for June since records began in 1850\u2014an event of such intensity rarely seen outside the tropics and the Mediterranean (Fig 2)."

However, the impacts in UK waters such as those experienced during the UK 2023 heatwave, can be difficult to predict, monitor and quantify. As UK waters continue to warm, and the frequency of marine heatwaves is predicted to increase, the distinction between extreme events, and long-term warming becomes increasingly blurred. Temperatures that we now consider as marine heatwaves are likely to become the new norm in future years."

It is critical to provide policymakers and stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed decisions for both people and the environment. In response, the Met Office and Cefas have joined forces recognising that a collective approach \u2014leveraging the complementary capabilities of multiple organisations\u2014is essential to understand both the weather and climate drivers of marine heatwaves and their impacts on the health of our seas."

The OSTIA (Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis) system, developed in the 1980s, monitors SST\u2019s globally, helping to track marine heatwaves worldwide."

One generates 6-day forecasts with a spatial resolution of 1.5km, and the other forecasts at 7km resolution. These models also predict oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels, nutrient availability and markers of phytoplankton to understand the health of our seas. A new innovative km-scale atmosphere-ocean-wave-biogeochemistry coupled model is also in development. This will allow longer range forecasting to capture whole system changes to our marine environment. These models, datasets and observations have been instrumental in helping to understand the unprecedented June 2023 marine heatwave."

Through its network of state-of-the-art autonomous monitoring buoys, Cefas collects real-time data on SSTs, which feeds into Met Office forecasts and long-term reporting. In August 2022, Cefas' WaveNet buoys recorded (Fig 4) some of the highest sustained seawater temperatures ever recorded around the British Isles, exceeding 21\u00b0C off the Thames Estuary. This real-time data is integrated into Cefas\u2019 datacube viewer (Fig 3) which in 2023 allowed scientists and forecasters to track the development and spatial spread of the UK marine heatwave over time. Technological advances in data collection now allow thousands of sea temperature measurements to be gathered every minute\u2014a significant leap from the days when scientists recorded only a few measurements each year using pen and paper!"

Recent analysis by the Met Office of the unprecedented June 2023 marine heatwave has provided valuable insights into the weather patterns and physical drivers that caused this event and also the subsequent impacts on inland UK temperatures (Fig 5). This analysis was also used to understand the most recent May 2024 marine heatwave, which found that both marine heatwaves contributed to breaking UK land temperature records by a large margin. Further research is ongoing to refine which weather patterns are associated with marine heatwaves around the UK, as well as the biological impacts."

            "text": "Marine heatwaves in the UK are generally short-lived, lasting between 5-15 days due to our highly variable climate. They often occur during hot, dry and windless conditions that make it difficult for warmer water in the upper layers of the ocean to mix with cooler water below. Marine heatwaves typically end when stronger winds release the heat into the atmosphere or redistribute it into the ocean. Certain areas, like the English Channel and parts of the Irish Sea are less prone to surface based marine heatwaves due to strong tidal currents."

            "text": "Between 1993 and 2019, marine heatwaves occurred almost yearly around the UK, though their biological impacts remain poorly understood. Some of the main challenges in understanding marine heatwaves is generating accurate and consistent \u2018in situ\u2019 data. While gliders deployed by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the Scottish Association for Marine Science during the 2023 heatwave were at the right place at the right time, allowing real time monitoring of the event and providing valuable data into what was happening beneath the surface, large areas of the UK\u2019s 12,000 km of coastline do not have autonomous monitoring systems. Improved data collection and increased monitoring are vital to enable scientists to better understand complex ecosystems and physical properties (e.g. temperature) in UK waters allowing for better identification of marine heatwaves and their impacts.\u00a0 Also, a more responsive, real-time monitoring system, which could be triggered as a marine heatwave occurs, could significantly enhance our understanding of future events."

            "text": "Long-term monitoring and data collection from coastal regions throughout the UK, including observations at depth, also remain a challenge. Initiatives like the Western Channel Observatory, jointly maintained by Plymouth Marine Laboratory, have helped bridge this gap by providing over 100 years of data on long-term changes in ocean heat content at depth. However, more long-term data is needed to better understand marine heatwaves in their historical context and track their development and impacts over time. Additionally, better coordination, increased data sharing across UK regions, and increased investment in research are crucial to gaining a deeper understanding of marine extremes."

They can disrupt the growth rate and reproductive systems of marine organisms, cause metabolic disruption and disease leading to mass mortality events, impact ecosystem services and cause large-scale changes to species density and distribution.

Another lesser-known impact is their role in increasing the risk of infectious diseases dangerous to humans. During the 2018 UK marine heatwave, Cefas found increased levels of pathogenic Vibrio species, both in the water and in shellfish from several sites along the southwest coast of the UK.\u00a0New research by Cefas shows that pathogens causing serious threat to health, such as Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio cholerae, can all be found in UK waters and present an emerging threat to public health here and around the world.\u00a0"

Limited data on the real-time impacts of heatwaves, combined with the potential lag in the appearance of some biological and ecological effects (which sometimes become evident only a few years later) adds to the uncertainty. The effects on species can also be complex and mixed, with both \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 implications for species and the people that depend on them."

Long-term warming due to climate change has also been linked to an increase in habitat suitability for certain UK marine species, with localised decreases for others."

For example, recent research by the Kent & Essex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) and the University of Essex has revealed that mass mortalities of whelk in the Thames Estuary in August 2022 coincided with record temperatures measured by Cefas. Interestingly no similar mass mortality events of whelks were reported during the 2023 heatwave. "

A whole systems-based approach, where data from diverse sources is analysed and interpreted, including the use of new approaches to pattern recognition (including AI) will be key. Future collaboration and research with partners will be vital to understand these trends. This knowledge will be essential to ensure the fishing industry, consumers and stakeholders continue to prepare and adapt to a changing climate."

A marine heatwave monitoring system, such as the prototype currently under development by the Met Office, could serve as a valuable \u2018early warning\u2019 tool for alerting stakeholders to marine heatwaves and their potential impacts.

Would impact-based criteria, such as those used for land-based heatwaves, be more useful in defining marine heatwaves? These questions underscore the importance for Met Office, Cefas and partners to continue ongoing research and collaboration to prepare for a future where marine heatwaves are an ever-present challenge. \u00a0"
