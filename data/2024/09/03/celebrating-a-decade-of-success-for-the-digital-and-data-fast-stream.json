As well as, spotlight sessions on digital strategy to practical sessions on coding and its benefits to both technical and non-technical civil servants. The interns within CDDO and GDS were particularly well-placed to take advantage of all of the learning opportunities during the day, here\u2019s what they had to say:"

The scope for digital and data is ever-expanding, and so one can only imagine the successes we will be celebrating in another decade\u2019s time!"
