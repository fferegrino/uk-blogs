However, unconnected systems are making it difficult for councils to use data effectively, impacting their commitment.\u00a0"

            "text": "This issue has been evident across Local Digital Fund projects, where nearly half focused on leveraging data to improve service delivery. The use cases vary: for instance, Stockport\u2019s Family Context helps social workers quickly access a child's family information for thorough needs assessments, while Westmorland & Furness Council\u2019s VIPER tool uses data to identify vulnerable households during emergencies, ensuring they receive the support they need."

There are some projects, such as Family Context, that have successfully navigated these obstacles. This project developed a solution that links data from social care, education, and health systems to help frontline workers better support vulnerable families. This solution, which includes an open-source rules engine, is now in use within the council.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "However, scaling this solution introduces another challenge. Each council operates with its own unique software systems, data structures, and agreements with external organisations. While the rules engine can be adopted by other councils, strict interpretations of compliance requirements prevent the use of existing data-sharing agreements. As a result, each council must independently navigate the process of accessing and extracting data from various systems and organisations."

            "text": "This highlights the need for a more centralised approach. By addressing these challenges at a broader level, we can help councils develop their own data processes while also moving toward solutions that work across the entire sector. In doing so, we can reduce duplication and foster widespread innovation.\u00a0"
