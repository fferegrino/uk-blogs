We\u2019re passionate about improving the user experience and creating a diverse and inclusive environment, so we really wanted to understand what was stopping teams from fully embedding accessibility in all stages of design, development, and deployment. We conceived the idea of an accessibility assurance review."

            "text": "We were dealing with a very large, modular system that all our staff use, often several times a week. Testing components against WCAG criteria was helpful to highlight issues, but we weren\u2019t really moving forward in creating an accessibility mindset. To help us find out why, we had to understand how the multi-disciplinary product teams could better integrate accessibility into development processes instead."

            "text": "First, we did an extensive review of materials created by the delivery team including: emails, minutes, Jira tickets, contracts, specifications, research plans and test reports. We noted any references to accessibility. We looked at how prominently accessibility featured throughout the full development lifecycle of the product and really focused on how well it was understood in all aspects of delivery."

These open conversations also increased engagement and insight into accessibility. Gathering honest insight from the team helped us to correctly identify root causes, rather than focusing on just the symptoms within the system. As a result, our recommendations were both practical and achievable."

The sponsorship of the director and this enduring relationship with the team is what made the accessibility assurance review such a success. Throughout, accomplishments were celebrated, and good practice was highlighted and encouraged."

We also had to spend time building relationships with the people we wanted to speak to, so we could be sure their answers would be open and honest. Without this trust, we wouldn\u2019t get to the root of the problems. Spending this extra time really paid off though, as all the team really got behind the review."

This is setting an excellent example which can be replicated across the organisation."
