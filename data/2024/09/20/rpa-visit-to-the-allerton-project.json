Members are from across different areas within RPA. As well as sharing best practice, they look at the problems customers experience from different angles to help ensure that RPA improves its services and provides a seamless customer experience.\u00a0"

Board members learned about the impact of different farming methods, the effect of weather,\u00a0the ways they\u2019re trying to maximise land use and about their agroforestry trials. The board also spent time discussing the wider challenges across the agricultural sector and how RPA can help its customers to deliver their outcomes."

This helps us to improve our services to make things easier for our customers to access support.\u00a0We found the visit really insightful and we walked around different areas of the farm to get a real feel for different land uses, the challenges faced by farmers and the ways the funding we deliver can help\u201d."

Having grown up on a farm she didn\u2019t initially think there would be much she could learn, but said: \u201chow wrong I was! At the Allerton Project they really made us think about how there are so many factors impacting agriculture, the majority of which are outside the farmer\u2019s control e.g. climate change. This February was the wettest on record, compared with last year which was the driest - and that has a massive effect on getting crops sown, growth rates and the success of the crop. Already they\u2019re thinking about how they\u2019re going to feed animals through the winter months; will there be enough forage to go around? Coupled with other rising costs, especially fertiliser and fuel, this all adds to the stresses of farming\"."

They aim to support farmers by offering greater levels of advice, guidance and signposting to help improve compliance with standards and scheme requirements. Janine\u2019s intelligence team will be recommending different types of visits with customers. For her, it was great to get an understanding of how field visits are normally received and be able to change customers\u2019 perceptions in a positive way."

        {
            "text": "She added: \u201cIt was great to see options stacked side by side, or the impact of the same item being planted in different parts of a field using different methodology and the resultant crops (or in some cases lack of crops!) Talking about the challenges farmers face and hearing how the weather was having such a detrimental effect on the project\u2019s planting plans wasn\u2019t something I would have truly understood as a non-farmer, so having that as context was also useful. It\u2019s going to sound na\u00efve, but I was so surprised that each parcel of land could be so different \u2013 and that there could be differences within the parcel. One size doesn\u2019t fit all was my takeaway\u201d."
