            "text": "However, increasingly we hear from employers and sponsoring departments that public servants are unaware of, or unengaged by their public service pension provision. This suggests that a signi\ufb01cant element of public service employers\u2019 value proposition to their sta\ufb00 is underappreciated or simply not understood. Addressing this could mean employers\u2019 pension contributions deliver better value for public money, and potentially help aid recruitment and boost current staff retention."

Public servants often receive separate annual statements about pay from their employer and their pension from their public service scheme. Combining information on both in a total reward statement would give public servants a single picture of their total pay and pension package. This may be easier for them to engage with."

            "text": "In the de\ufb01ned contribution arrangements that are the norm outside of the public sector, the scheme members individually bear many of these risks without being able to access the advantages of pooling of risk.

The chart below is an illustration of how this might potentially compare for a typical public service scheme."
