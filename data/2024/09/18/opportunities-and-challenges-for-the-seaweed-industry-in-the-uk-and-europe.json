            "text": "Every new industry or technology requires funding to survive, initially for research and development (R&D), developing processes and products, and then to scaling up to a viable business. A lot of the initial research is supported by public funding, which is subsequently replaced by private investments when the technology/product has been established and proven viable and scalable. However, in between these two extremes, there is a phase (known as the \u2018innovation valley of death\u2019; Figure 1) when public funds start to reduce (as solutions are being tested and problems identified) and private investments are low (due to uncertainties around the scaling up potential of the industry). When transitioning through this stage, progress slows down and some technologies/industries never come out of this \u2018valley\u2019."

            "text": "The seaweed aquaculture industry in the UK and Europe is novel but has been growing in the last decade. This is demonstrated by the increase in the number of existing commercial seaweed farms, businesses and available seaweed-based products on the market and growing political support (https://marinescience.blog.gov.uk/2022/05/05/the-developing-uk-seaweed-industry/; Ara\u00fajo et al. (2021) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.626389). To unlock and harness the full potential of the industry, cultivation and production need to be upscaled and relevant markets for food and non-food applications need to be developed (https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/publications/communication-commission-towards-strong-and-sustainable-eu-algae-sector_en)."

            "text": "However, upscaling is hindered by multiple issues; some of them targeted by recent/current projects in the UK (e.g. Seaweed in East Anglia https://hethelinnovation.com/seaweed-in-east-anglia/; WWF UK\u2019s Seaweed Solutions Programme; Project Madog https://projectmadoc.cymru/home/). Particularly, difficulties remain in obtaining licences for seaweed aquaculture and funding availability for prospective seaweed farmers. Furthermore, lack of standards on farming and products, technological barriers, and the need for social licence to operate and spatial planning are still important issues, common to the UK and Europe."
