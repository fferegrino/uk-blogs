Since then, we have taken a continuous improvement at pace approach to ensure the framework gives users a clear and accurate understanding of digital and data roles and skills in government. This is critical to support colleagues exploring and assessing their career development, departments needing to recruit, and members of the public wanting to apply for roles in government."
