The \u2018core\u2019 lies around 25,000 light years away in the direction of the constellations of Sagittarius, Ophiuchus and Scorpius. You can use the star map below to locate these constellations for yourself."

            "text": "The brightest star in this part of the sky is Antares, the heart of the constellation of Scorpius. Antares is red super-giant star that lies around 550 light years away, and is a remarkable 700 times larger than our Sun. Placed at the centre of our solar system, it would extend out to between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and shine 10,000 times brighter than our Sun."

            "text": "Noctilucent Clouds are earth\u2019s highest clouds, and are formed by ice crystals floating on the edge of space over 80km (50 miles) up in our atmosphere. While the Sun is below the horizon for those of us on the ground, the high altitude of these ice crystals means they are under-lit by the Sun, causing them to glow silvery-blue in our night sky."

        {
            "text": "Studies have shown that the dust from meteors that have entered our atmosphere and burned up is a key component in forming these clouds, binding the ice-crystals together. Noctilucent Clouds have also been linked to volcanic activity, leading scientists to believe volcanic ash may cause a similar affect."

        {
            "text": "Noctilucent Clouds form nearer polar regions as that is where the mesosphere is coldest (around -120 degrees Celsius), and as a result tend only to be visible at latitudes of 50 degrees or more above or below the equator."

        {
            "text": "Thankfully this means this spectacular night sky sight can be spotted across the UK, and the angle of the Sun\u2019s light means Noctilucent Clouds are usually spotted in the northern sky an hour or two after sunset and before sunrise. Look for the characteristic glow and the appearance of \u2018texture\u2019 or patterns within them, compared to the darker, featureless \u2018blobs\u2019 of normal clouds that lie at much lower altitudes."

            "text": "Look high overhead as darkness falls, and the first three stars to emerge will be those of the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019. These bright stars are Vega (in constellation Lyra), Altair (constellation Aquila) and Deneb (constellation Cygnus)."

        {
            "text": "Vega and Altair are bright because they are relatively close to our Sun, being around 25 and 16 light-years away respectively. Deneb however is believed to be between 1,500 and 2,500 light-years away, and appears bright because it is between 100 and 200 times larger than our Sun."
