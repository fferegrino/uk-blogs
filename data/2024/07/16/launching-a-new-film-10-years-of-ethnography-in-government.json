We have brought our ethnographic approach to independent reviews, the creation of strategies, the development and testing of policy and services and much more. A decade on, we are launching a new film to showcase examples of our film ethnography work across government. You can watch the three-minute film here:\u00a0"

It involves spending time with participants and really listening to the \u2018what\u2019, \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 - in their own worlds. You can read more about the ethnographic method, and how it can provide a compelling form of evidence, here. Ethnography is one of Policy Lab\u2019s foundational methods, and we use this approach to gather lived experience insights for policy teams.\u00a0"
