            "text": "If an operator claims the material on offer is not a waste, ask them where it\u2019s come from and how it has come about. As a rule of thumb, if it has been removed from somewhere, it is surplus to requirements or it has been through some kind of sorting or treatment process (such as crushing) it\u2019s safer to assume it is a waste. There is a complex process to turn a waste back into a non-waste which requires operators to provide customers with evidence that it meets the relevant Quality Protocol (QP). Ask for this QP evidence up front and don\u2019t accept technical sounding responses as to why it\u2019s not needed. Asking for the QP evidence makes you sound like you\u2019re aware of the rules and as such, makes you less desirable and less likely to become a victim of waste crime."
