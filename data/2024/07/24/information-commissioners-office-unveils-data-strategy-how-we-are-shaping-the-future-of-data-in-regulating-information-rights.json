Central to this was creating a robust data strategy to harness the power of the data we hold. The strategy aims to set out how the ICO will develop, manage, govern, and use its data assets to \u201cempower individuals through information.\u201d\nSo how did we go about it \u2013 and what does it mean for you?"
