Farm Safety Week, starting on 22 July, is the ten-year anniversary of the campaign, which brings together more than 400 partners in five countries with one simple goal - to encourage everyone in the industry to make our farms safer places to live and to work."

They remind farmers that, while they cannot eliminate risk completely, they can minimise it and learn from every near-miss to improve their working practices. The team will introduce audiences to inspirational individuals using their own experiences to encourage others to stay alert to the hazards on farm and offer practical guidance on how to make farms safer places to live, visit or work."

It also offers an opportunity for a reset in the way farmers approach farm safety and risk-taking."

Attitudes and behaviours around farm safety and mental health are changing but the pace of change is slow \u2013 too slow for the families of those we have lost in the industry and too slow for the thousands of farmers suffering every day with long term ill-health, serious injuries or poor mental health.\u201d"

Working in partnership with other like-minded organisations can help amplify important messages throughout the week. We need to challenge this industry\u2019s safety behaviours and we need to change our poor safety record. Together we can make a difference not just for the farmers of today but for the farmers of the future.\u201d"
