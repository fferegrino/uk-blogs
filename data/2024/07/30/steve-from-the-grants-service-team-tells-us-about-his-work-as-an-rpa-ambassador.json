In this blog, Steve France from the Grants Service team writes about his work attending shows as an RPA Ambassador. The Ambassadors represent RPA by engaging with a wide variety of external audiences including farmers and stakeholders and get the chance to gain an increased appreciation of the farming industry. "

I\u2019ve been to several shows and events this summer as an RPA Ambassador, which is a great opportunity to learn more about what we do and meet those we support."

            "text": "It\u2019s interesting to hear people\u2019s stories, the genuine passion and care for the environment and the desire to create a sustainable future business for others. It\u2019s amazing what you can learn from those around you in a very short time at these events. My knowledge and ability to answer questions grew from observing others in action and vice versa for others when I was answering enquires about my area of the business, which is Grants."

Those we support have a hard job and to hear positive feedback about what our team has worked on is really satisfying."
