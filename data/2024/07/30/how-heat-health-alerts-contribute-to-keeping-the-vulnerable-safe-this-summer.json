This week\u2019s higher temperatures have triggered a yellow Heat-Health Alert, issued for England by the Met Office and UKHSA. While some may question the necessity of such warnings, it's crucial to understand the significant health implications that accompany changes in temperature."

The once-unthinkable prospect of a 40\u00b0C day in the UK became a reality in the summer of 2022, a stark reminder of our changing climate. Alongside this shift, we've observed a steady rise in heat-associated health impacts, particularly in heat-related deaths."

            "text": "The UKHSA's annual heat mortality reporting, which began in 2016, reveals a concerning trend. The summer of 2022, which saw record-breaking temperatures, also recorded the highest number of heat-associated deaths. Although 2023 was comparatively cooler, we still experienced 5 heat episodes (2 amber and 3 yellow) resulting in over 2,000 heat-associated deaths. Notably, significant mortality occurred even during periods when yellow Heat-Health Alerts were issued, underscoring the importance of taking precautions at all alert levels."

            "text": "As had been observed in previous years, the majority of heat-associated deaths in 2023 occurred in older age groups, particularly among people over 75 years of age. Across the summer, there were significant heat-associated deaths in all English regions except for the East of England and the North East. Adjusting for population size, the South East region had the highest heat-associated mortality rate."

Our Beat the Heat guidance includes a full list of people at a higher risk of becoming unwell in hot weather."
