We celebrate this milestone wholeheartedly, but we\u2019re not resting on our laurels. We see BNG becoming mandatory as the beginning of the journey, not the end."

It relies on land managers using BNG as a way to fund nature recovery. It relies on many different professionals and enablers supporting both those groups. And fundamentally, it relies on Local Planning Authorities (LPAs)."

BNG creates greener and more attractive places in which to live and work. By increasing the amount of nature around us, BNG also improves people's health and well-being. How can BNG do all of this? By being strategic."

            "text": "Being strategic means assessing how best to deliver benefits for nature that will have maximum impact, first and foremost for wildlife but also for local people and communities. It means tying BNG delivery to emerging Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs) to maximise its impact. It means enabling landowners to provide the habitats that are locally needed by entering into legal agreements with them, for example a Section 106 agreement."
        },
        {
            "text": "Being strategic also means assessing best use of often finite LPA staffing resource. We recognise the multitudes of pressures facing LPAs, so in practice, this means adopting a triage approach to focus energy on the big wins and big risks. This does not mean accepting exemptions where none apply, for example, small sites. Read more about biodiversity net gain, including de minimis exemptions."

This is an opportunity for peer support and sharing of resources. We know that every LPA is unique with its own social and natural landscape. However, this does not mean reinventing the wheel across the country."

For example, the Small Sites Metric has been designed so that it can make use of existing information. Some LPAs are drawing on local record centres who will already have required evidence, like the presence of European Protected Species. Others are pointing to existing LPA advice on how to screen certain types of development for likely species, like bats in semi-derelict buildings. Since sharing examples of good practice among peers, we\u2019re seeing more and more LPAs doing the same."

Once a developer has been granted planning permission, the metric used to baseline biodiversity should stay the same throughout post-decision delivery. The 30-year monitoring plan on the other hand, should make allowance for reasonable amendments. Examples of monitoring requirements can be accessed on PAS\u2019s website."

The scheme will help to ensure that the pace of development in England is not impacted by the introduction of mandatory BNG. LPAs agree whether a developer can buy statutory credits as part of the planning process. These statutory credits are available to buy only once planning permission has been granted and other options have been exhausted."

We\u2019re proud to play our part in getting Britain building by enabling sustainable growth. Sustainable development and nature recovery can sit side by side, but it takes effort across sectors and geographies to pull together for national change.
