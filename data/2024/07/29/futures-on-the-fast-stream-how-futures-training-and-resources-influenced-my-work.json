The course offered a blended approach to learning, including video interviews, articles, and long-read case studies, as well as discussion forums for learners to reflect on particular topics and contribute their own ideas. I was really impressed by the breadth and depth of the learning on offer and the array of examples from the UK Civil Service, international governments, and non-governmental organisations around the world.

Upon completing the course, I was eager to ensure that my own work reflected this longer-term strategic outlook.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "I was grateful for my introduction to futures when starting my final Fast Stream posting, working for the Scottish Government as a Policy Officer on its proposed Wellbeing and Sustainable Development Bill. The aim of the Bill was to make improvements to the effectiveness of decision-making by ensuring that all policy and delivery activity undertaken by public bodies in Scotland is focused on improving the wellbeing of people living in Scotland, not only now but also in the future. Amongst other suggested measures, the Bill advocated for the creation of a \u2018Future Generations Commissioner\u2019 within the Scottish Government, who, acting on behalf of future generations, would be empowered to hold public bodies, including Ministers, to account."

            "text": "The role of Future Generations Commissioner was pioneered and introduced by the Welsh Government, something I\u2019d come across as a case study during my futures training. It was exciting to collaborate with those involved developing the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act and explore whether similar measures would suit Scotland\u2019s unique social, political, economic and cultural circumstances."

            "text": "I was also introduced to colleagues within the Strategic Insights Unit (SIU) while working in this role. This is a team of analysts and policy professionals who use futures tools and techniques to work collaboratively with policy colleagues to investigate topics likely to be of importance to Scotland in the future. The team uses literature, data and expert opinion to understand implications specific to Scotland and to develop insights into how we can strengthen current policy to shape the future and be ready for future challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m delighted to see futures thinking being used in government, and I hope that moving forward, all key policy teams work together with futures analysts. The SIU has recently restructured to create a new Foresight and Capability Unit, who hold responsibility for Futures activity for Scottish Government.\u00a0"
