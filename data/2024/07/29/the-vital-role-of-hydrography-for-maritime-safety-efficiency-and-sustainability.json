Much of the collaborative work done by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the UKHO and other partners often goes unnoticed. Still, it is crucial for ensuring the safety of life at sea, supporting safe navigation and protecting our oceans."

We have conducted successful S-100 sea trials with the Port of London Authority and have scheduled more trials with the Port of Milford Haven and the Port of Southampton. Recently, I also visited our counterparts in South Korea and witnessed firsthand their S-100 development lab, which is a tremendous example of their innovation and their openness to collaboration."
