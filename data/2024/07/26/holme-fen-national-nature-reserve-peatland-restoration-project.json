Years of drainage for nearby agriculture has dried out the peat here, causing greenhouse gases to be released and habitats for important species to disappear. So we\u2019re hoping to re-wet Holme Fen to preserve the remaining peat and restore habitats for nature.\u00a0"

Pre-drainage, Holme Fen would have been a raised bog of about six metres of wet, spongy peat. Peat loss across the whole fenland basin has been huge. We should really be able to squeeze the water out of peat, but now it\u2019s very dry here."

            "text": "At Holme Fen, the surrounding area was extensively drained in the 1850s. At the time, the landowner foresaw the impact on peat, so he installed a post to measure the shrinkage. The post was pushed into the wet peat and the top was flush with the ground. Since 1851, over four metres of peat has been lost and the posts (a second post was installed later) are now very visible above ground. The shrinkage has started to slow down but it\u2019s still reducing by about 9mm a year.\u00a0"

There\u2019s so much more carbon held in peat than a tropical rainforest because peat is solid and dense, so we\u2019re trying to keep our remaining peat here. Preventing further greenhouse gas emissions is so important as climate change worsens.\u00a0\u00a0"

After some final modelling, we will apply for planning permission later this year.\u00a0\u00a0"

In 50 years\u2019 time, you will see a changed landscape at Holme Fen and hopefully more species thriving.\u00a0"
