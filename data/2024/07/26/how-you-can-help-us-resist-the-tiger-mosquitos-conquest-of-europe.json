One such challenge is the potential introduction of invasive mosquito species, particularly the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus). This small but formidable insect is causing concern among public health officials across Europe, and for good reason."

Their work involves assessing the risks posed by arthropods \u2013 primarily ticks and mosquitoes \u2013 that can act as vectors for disease transmission."

            "text": "The tiger mosquito is not just any mosquito. It's highly adaptable, capable of breeding in both natural and artificial water containers, and unlike many of its counterparts, it bites during the day. What's more, its eggs can survive frost, allowing it to potentially establish itself in cooler climates. It was initially named the Asian tiger mosquito but is now called the tiger mosquito due to its distribution far beyond the continent where it was first identified."

In 2022, it was responsible for over 60 cases of dengue in the South of France, and in 2023, 3 locally acquired dengue cases were reported in Paris."

            "text": "The overall risk of vector-borne disease for UK travellers in mainland Europe remains low and is considerably lower than travel to other parts of the world where it is endemic. However, there is a risk that patients and medical practitioners will dismiss any possibility of catching dengue fever in Europe and fail to identify symptoms."

Climate modelling suggests that parts of South East England, particularly around London, may already have suitable conditions for the mosquito's survival, prompting intensified surveillance in these areas."
