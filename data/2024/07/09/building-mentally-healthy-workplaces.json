In the Department for Education Covid team, the stakes were high and the pressure relentless. Being authentic with my colleagues helped me navigate the challenges effectively. I had never met or worked with most of my team before. By voicing difficulties I was experiencing, I was not only helping myself, but role-modelling to them that this was a safe place to share our feelings without judgment.
