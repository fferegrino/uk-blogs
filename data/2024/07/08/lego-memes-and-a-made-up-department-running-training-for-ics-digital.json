I run our \u2018introduction to ICS Digital\u2019 training (we cover our services, agile, governance, and buying digital). They are fun to do, and essential for new members of staff or those about to embark on digital projects. But running virtual training sessions can be a challenge."

Previous comments were, \u2018use more examples.\u2019 This is helpful feedback; the subjects are broad yet full of detail. People spend weeks learning agile. I have 45 minutes, including questions, to get my audience up to working knowledge."

Then I give them a scenario, like an email from someone who has bought some unsanctioned and potentially risky service licenses without telling us. Each component is based on something I have experienced. Realism is important in making it work. No one gets named or shamed."

I can show a service developing in a modular way, I can ask for a change, I can show how it\u2019s harder to change when you\u2019ve finished building than when you are part way through."

I am hidden by my slides; my audience is hidden muted and off camera. Where now is the room\u2019s collective personality? One thing that has not changed is we still don\u2019t like answering questions in public! Polls can work to improve engagement; I\u2019ll see if there is room for one next time."
