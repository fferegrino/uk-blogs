I want this moment to mark a reset in our relationship: under this new government, education will once again be at the heart of change and the forefront of national life. I can\u2019t wait to start working together with you as we begin to transform our system so that young people get the skills, care and opportunities they deserve."

            "text": "I know how hard you work to support our learners and families; you are key to breaking down barriers to opportunity and improving life chances for every child. You have supported our children and young people through a great deal of disruption \u2013 guiding their curiosity, building their resilience, and helping them achieve and thrive. You and your work are essential to the change this government wants to achieve across the country, and I want our renewed relationship to reflect that."

        {
            "text": "My commitment to the sector is deeply personal. I grew up in a family that knew the value of a good education. I was also fortunate enough to go to great local state schools filled with committed staff who saw the value and worth in each and every one of us. I\u2019m so grateful for all the people in my life who nurtured within me a love of learning and the confidence to succeed \u2013 I would not be here without them."

            "text": "I grew up on a council street in the Northeast of England. At that time in the 1980s and early \u201890s, it was a place with many challenges, where far too many children were held back by their background.\u00a0But background should be no barrier to getting on."

            "text": "I am determined that we will drive change together. Working with all of you, we want to build a fairer society with a government that delivers the best life chances for every child. That\u2019s what motivates me and that\u2019s why we will work tirelessly to deliver on our opportunity mission, tackling barriers like inadequate housing and child poverty that undermine family security and make it so hard for children to learn."

            "text": "There\u2019s a lot of work to be done to realise this mission against some major challenges. A huge part of my role is to understand the scale of the challenges you are facing, and the support needed to fix them. The scar of child poverty, severe financial pressures squeezing all your budgets, high workload, climbing vacancy rates, strain on care, mental health and SEND services, among many other issues, have made your jobs increasingly difficult. This is a tough inheritance \u2013 none of these have quick and easy solutions but I will work with and for you to find practical ways forward."
        },
        {
            "text": "Supported by your experience and expertise, this government will expand our early years education system, drive high and rising standards and reform curriculum and assessment. Work to recruit 6,500 new expert teachers for our schools and colleges starts now, and we will bring forward a comprehensive strategy for post\u201016 education, work with local government to provide loving, secure homes for children in care, provide support for children with SEND and their families, and create higher-quality training and employment paths by empowering local communities to develop the skills people need.\u00a0We will secure the future of our world class universities as engines of growth, ambition and opportunity for all."

            "text": "This change is simple to describe, but vast to deliver. Government can\u2019t do it alone \u2013 we will work with you as essential and valued partners to deliver our shared mission. I want to renew the trust and respect we hold for each other. My commitment to you is to listen, to draw on your wealth of experience and to act on your honest feedback."

            "text": "As an initial step, I want to invite you to join me for a live event at 4pm on Tuesday 16th July where I\u2019ll share more about my vision for the education system, but I really want to hear from you too. There will be a chance for you to share your views and ask me questions in the live chat function."
