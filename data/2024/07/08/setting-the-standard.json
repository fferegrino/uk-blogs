After campaigning hard and knocking on doors, the new teams and staffers must familiarise themselves with their roles and departmental briefs. Impartial civil servants must turn and serve the new administration and be ready to deliver their policies."

Like any new job, there is always a steep learning curve and for many it may be their first step into public life. There is a unique aspect to holding public office, that of service. At its core that means they must take decisions on behalf of the public and do so in their wider interest.\u00a0"

They have stood the test of time and are\u00a0 the bedrock of a range of rules and codes of conduct, including the Code of Conduct for MPs owned by the House of Commons.\u00a0"

At a time when trust in public life is so fragile, I urge all MPs to hold those Principles close and seek advice from the regulators and clerks if in doubt. Most MPs undoubtedly want to do the right thing, but negative stories about a minority have done immeasurable damage to the perception of Parliament and government over the years.\u00a0 This perception can be changed."

Ministers will be expected to act in line with that Code and the principles that underlie it. New Ministers will already have started declaring any conflicts of interest and will be expected to resolve those, seeking advice from the Independent Adviser on Ministers\u2019 Interests. Similarly, Ministers and civil servants leaving public office must protect the integrity of government by ensuring their moves to new roles are properly risk assessed under the Business Appointment Rules.\u00a0"

Many of those structures were created as result of CSPL recommendations over the last 30 years. Our 2021 landscape review \u2018Upholding Standards in Public Life\u2019 - along with reports from other bodies, academics and think tanks - proposed a strengthening of the system to provide greater independence, clearer rules and a stronger compliance culture in central government to help build and maintain wider public trust. There is unfinished business here requiring proper attention to address major risks to standards.\u00a0"
