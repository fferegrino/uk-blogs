HM Land Registry became \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 in November 2022 and, drawing on feedback from customers, we continue to adapt our services to more closely meet their needs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The move to digital is a crucial part of our efforts to provide a faster registration service.\u00a0"

Early in the year we introduced flags against applications that had outstanding requisitions, as well as a filter function to isolate those that needed a response. This change has made it much easier to find requisitions, reducing customers\u2019 reliance on emails.\u00a0"
