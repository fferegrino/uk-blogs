In this blog, Georgina Ling from the Grants Service team writes about her visit to Cowsden Bank Farm in Worcestershire, to understand their experience of applying for grant funding under the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund (FETF) "

            "text": "It's been important for me to see how the equipment for which we process the claims is used. This visit was very insightful, and it\u2019s been great to speak to grant recipients as well as helping with my understanding of why we do our work within Grants Service."

            "text": "I asked Colin whether he would recommend grants to other farmers and he told me: \u201cI definitely, definitely would. It's transformed our farming system going down the re-gen line and it's been really easy to do, and has helped us tremendously getting to where we want to go."

            "text": "Colin also does a lot of contract farming and share farming. His central store building was erected in 2018 through a Countryside Productivity grant. This is used for his share and his contract farming partners to blend the grain and get the quality right."

            "text": "Caroline said: \u201cIt was a really easy process and it gave a list of everything to complete the grant. The process itself was really easy, step by step. The first one took me a bit longer, but now we've done several and I've got the information stored from the previous grant. It probably takes between 15 to 30 minutes to apply, so really quick and easy. I think we're up to about five or six that we've applied for now.\u201d"

I accompanied RPA\u2019s filming team who\u2019ve been making case study videos about grants for farmers, which will be published on RPA\u2019s social media channels soon, as well as recording for the RPA podcast."

There, I really got to understand the importance of delivering great customer service. I\u2019m very new to RPA and grants, but it\u2019s been great to meet some of the farmers who have benefitted from the funding."
