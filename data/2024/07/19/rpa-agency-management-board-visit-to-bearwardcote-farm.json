In this blog, Robert from the Grants Service team writes about RPA\u2019s Agency Management Board visit to Bearwardcote Farm in Derbyshire talking to the farmers about their experience of applying for grant funding under the Farm Productivity grant."

            "text": "Members of RPA\u2019s Agency Management Board (AMB) were able to see first-hand how RPA\u2019s grants benefit the farming community, when they spent a day with father and son farmers Andrew and David, who are both passionate about a long-term future in the dairy sector. The predominantly dairy farm has over 200 dairy cows and grows 100 acres of arable, as well as keeping around 60 beef animals."

            "text": "They were given a tour of the farm by Andrew and David, who told them about the support they\u2019ve received from RPA and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI). The farm has benefitted from an Improving Farm Productivity grant which they have used to upgrade and update their milking equipment with four brand new Lely Astronaut robotic milking machines."
        },
        {
            "text": "Before the grant was awarded, up to nine hours a day were spent in the parlour. The robotic milkers have helped the cows reach their full potential by being milked more frequently. This will help to improve the technical performance of the dairy herd, and improve animal health and welfare, refining both the productivity and efficiency of the business."

        {
            "text": "Andrew told the AMB how the machinery freed up a lot of their time so they could carry out other tasks on the farm, allowing them to dedicate extra time and focus on other areas of the business. He said they\u2019d found the process of applying \u201cthorough\u201d but ultimately easy to complete with a collaborative family effort. Both Andrew and David had praise for the helpful RPA Grants Service staff, as well as the quick and efficient process for receiving their funding once their claims had been submitted."
        },
        {
            "text": "Members of the AMB also got a hands-on show of the grant-funded equipment \u2013 with all the new machines named after family members! The AMB took some time to solicit feedback from David and Andrew on the process of applying for grants and will be exploring with relevant teams in RPA how the process can be made even simpler for applicants."
        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew also encouraged other farmers to apply for available grants and said the Farming Transformation Fund was well named as it had been \u201ctotally transformational\u201d for the way the family now farms. He also plans to utilise other grants available through RPA, such as the Slurry Infrastructure Grant to assist with the cost of upgrading their facilities."

            "text": "David told members of AMB about SFI and how they\u2019d applied for funding for the processes they were already doing on the farm. Both David and Andrew agreed that the scheme had been improved since its inception and were looking forward to any future changes."
