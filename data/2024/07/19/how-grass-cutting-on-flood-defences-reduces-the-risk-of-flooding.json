This includes the banks of Main Rivers such as the Nene, Welland, Witham and Ancholme. These banks are man-made and help reduce the risk of flooding to people and property."

            "text": "On embankments where we only mow the top of the slopes, we mow when plant growth is vigorous, this encourages nesting birds to make their nests lower down the embankment slopes in the longer vegetation, away from machinery."

            "text": "Research has shown that regular close mowing (5-10cm) of grass improves the strength of the root network and erosion resistance of the grass. It also helps to protect the earth embankment underneath from external erosion caused by rainfall, wind, currents, wave action and traffic."
        },
        {
            "text": "Regular cutting also prevents broad leafed plants and woody vegetation from getting established. Such vegetation can damage the embankment beneath by root penetration, overturning, encouraging burrowing animals, discouraging adequate grass growth and concentrating flows which then cause scour."

            "text": "We have a team of biodiversity experts whose role it is to advise and help us adapt our maintenance work to support biodiversity where possible. For example, on appropriate embankments (where the impacts of flood risk are lower) we will only mow along the crest (top) of the embankment and a swathe (the width of the grass cutting head) at the top of the slopes. This is to ensure the crest edge is defined to provide safe access for driving machines.\u00a0 The long vegetation that is left lower down the embankment slopes is cut later in the year, therefore allowing for most plants to flower (providing nectar for pollinators) and to set seed; as well as providing cover and food sources for other animals, including water voles."

            "text": "Some of our grass cutting and maintenance does need to be carried out during nesting bird season. Nesting birds are legally protected, and so we apply stringent environmental checks before any work is carried out. This includes working with our internal biodiversity experts and carrying out walkovers before cutting begins, ensuring nests are not damaged."
