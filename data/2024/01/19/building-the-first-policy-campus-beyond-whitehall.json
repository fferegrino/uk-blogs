This builds on PfG commitments captured in the Declaration on Government Reform and the Government\u2019s Levelling Up white paper. "

It also aims to create strong partnerships with city and regional institutions such as the local universities, colleges, the city council and combined authority. This brings policy making closer to areas its interventions interact with, and strengthens the positive impact the Civil Service has on the city and wider region.\u00a0"
