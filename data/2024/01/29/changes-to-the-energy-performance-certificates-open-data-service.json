It provides both an interface and programmatic access to allow users to search for and download almost 30 million energy performance certificates in England and Wales. The site is well-used, and experiences high volumes of activity, with 30 million API requests and 40,000 zip files downloaded each month.\u00a0"

Our analysis revealed that the bulk downloads and API access are both well-used, but support tickets and helpdesk enquiries indicated we could make them better.\u00a0"
