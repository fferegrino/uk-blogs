Since then, they\u2019ve been using small group tutoring through the National Tutoring Programme (NTP), and it\u2019s proven to be effective in boosting pupils\u2019 preparedness for exams."

It was easy to extrapolate content lists and topics pupils needed to learn about. MyTutor then used this information to inform the content and delivery of each session. This has simplified our interactions and reduced administrative burden for our staff."

This included some of our disadvantaged pupils being excited about their sessions and openly telling their friends they\u2019ve \u2018got tuition after school\u2019."

I was predicted a 3 in both subjects but left with a 4. This helped me secure my apprenticeship and I am grateful to my school for providing this opportunity to ensure I was well prepared for GCSE examinations last summer\u201d."
