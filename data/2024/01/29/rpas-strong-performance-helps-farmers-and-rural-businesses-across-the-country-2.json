This final BPS payment marks the closure of this scheme, with delinked payments replacing BPS in England this year and running until the end of 2027, ensuring financial support remains consistent while more businesses are encouraged to enter the environmental land management schemes."

This saw an increase in interest from farmers and land managers across England. RPA has also been processing capital grant applications throughout 2023 which has helped, for instance, increase the planting and maintenance of hedgerows."
