My birthday is in a few weeks, and I've booked time off which I am looking forward to.\u00a0"

Staff are responsible for monitoring offenders according to their licence conditions.

Although, there is not an awful lot to do there except turn over the ground and make it ready for planting in the spring. \u00a0"

By the end of their residency, you can see a change in their attitude being more receptive and relaxed around the staff. After being in the service for over\u00a0twenty-four years I have supervised many offenders and found all the departments I have worked in equally rewarding. The challenge is to be firm, fair and consistent. Approved premises are an enabling environment where offenders feel they can live and be supported to turn their lives around. We have many successes which is rewarding, and it is extremely important to see offenders progress and move on. Overall, the feedback we receive is very good, most people leave feeling more optimistic about their future than before they arrived.\u00a0"
