This legislation recognised and positioned relational strengths and rights based social work practice, rather than process and procedure, as the keystone in supporting best outcomes for people. It tied this into the imperative of people with lived experience co-designing care services and helping shape a vision of social care fit for the 21st Century."

A shining example of this is the work they have led on the Social Care Workforce Race Equality Standards, helping to reflect, enable and empower the rich diversity of our care sector colleagues."

We now have more social workers in the NHS, bringing holistic and inclusive outcome approaches to working with people who have long term and/or multiple health conditions."

From the tragedy of Grenfell, to the privations of the pandemic, from war in Europe to the rising cost of living, we have and continue to be advocates, supporters and champions of those whose circumstances increase their vulnerabilities. I thank all of you for being there when our communities needed you the most."

However, your empathy, relentless focus on human rights and the primacy of the relationships you make with those you serve will, I am sure, continue to achieve great things. At its best, social work is truly transformative. It's been an honour to play my part in helping others be agents of that transformation."
