The space is now filled with everything that is needed to reduce a printer down to its last tiny metal nut and bolt, significantly reducing the volume of plastic (in particular!) ending up in landfill!"

It offers individuals a chance to earn accreditations and develop transferable skills for post-prison employment, fostering meaningful work and a pathway to employment. The environment also facilitates the acquisition of softer skills, such as interpersonal interaction which is equally available across the other workshops on site. The pride and dedication observed among both the workshop workers and staff contribute to a well-coordinated and efficient operation, despite its relatively short existence."
