It has helped me to compare the knowledge level I have now to the knowledge level I want to reach. \nAs you can optionally add line managers to review your self-assessment, this helped to set my learning and development goals as part of my end-of-year development discussion. Conveniently, you can also review progress at any time. I particularly like the recommended learning options, through which you can access resources to support you in reaching your desired development targets.\u00a0"
