            "text": "I often hear talk about the importance of people having the right (or wrong) values and it's the same for organisations. The latter most frequently voiced through the media where an organisation is pinpointed as not living up to their publicly stated values, with the charge that what they say they stand for is not what their customers actually experience."

            "text": "This gives us a clue as to why we should be bothered about values in social care. They are often seen as straightforward and non-contentious, for example, who would disagree with the statement \u2018I am treated with respect and dignity\u2019 from Think Local Act Personal (TLAP)\u2019s Making it Real? No one, I suspect. But here\u2019s the rub."
        },
        {
            "text": "At their heart, values are based on beliefs about what we think is right or wrong. They act as a sort of compass, guiding the choices we make in life and influencing our behaviours: \u2018the talk we walk\u2019."
        },
        {
            "text": "For people who draw on care, support from people who have the right skills, knowledge and training is important, but if they don\u2019t hold the right values you are unlikely to experience good person-centred care and support. Values translate into behaviour, and that\u2019s what people experience in their care and support, day to day."
        },
        {
            "text": "That\u2019s why TLAP was pleased to be asked by colleagues in the Department of Health and Social Care working on the new Care Workforce Pathway to find out from people with lived experience what they thought about the sorts of values they would hope to see in the people that support them."

        },
        {
            "text": "All the rich conversations we held were condensed into a series of straightforward value statements, which we are pleased have been incorporated into the Pathway. There is some nuance of course. For example, people wanted care staff to value safety, but didn\u2019t want to be wrapped in cotton wool, so there are areas where a balance needs to be struck."

            "text": "Much depends on workers being able to work with and alongside the people they support in the context of an ongoing relationship. This highlights the true nature of the skill and empathy that doing a good job requires, working with and alongside people. We look forward to continuing to support work to translate the values into practice as a central underpinning of good person-centred care and support."
