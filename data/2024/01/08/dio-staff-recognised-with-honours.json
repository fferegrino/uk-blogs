SSG is DIO\u2019s team of experts which provides and maintains security systems for MOD sites, and from time to time, other important buildings. For example, they installed a security system at Westminster Hall for HM The Queen\u2019s lying in state.\u00a0\u00a0"

He had to keep the honour a secret between finding out in November and the end of the embargo on 29th December, when the details were made public. Happily, he was able to suprise his family with the unexpected news during a Christmas get-together. \u00a0"

This was the evacuation of over 2400 UK nationals from Sudan to MOD bases in Cyprus in April and May last year. The team worked tirelessly to support the increase in military personnel and the civilians they evacuated. This included providing over 100,000 additional meals, and ensuring the availability of products such as sanitary towels and shower gel. Due to the nature of the evacuation, much of this was, by necessity, at extremely short notice and required hard work and dedication from all of the DIO and Sodexo personnel involved. \u00a0"

She has worked with Sodexo since 1995 and her commendation recognised the entirety of that time, but with a focus on a few particular acts of service. In 2015, Christina led the Sodexo team in supporting the evacuation of nearly 250 people from a cruise ship near the Falkland Islands. The team ensured sufficient accommodation was clean and available for use, arranged meals and phone lines, and Christina co-ordinated the provision of clothing donated by colleagues. During the Covid pandemic, Christina worked to ensure sufficient cleaning supplies were available despite a logistic chain made fragile by the challenges of the pandemic, as well as leading her team to make sure high standards of cleaning were maintained, helping to prevent infection and ensuring flights could continue to operate.\u00a0\u00a0"

Finally, the Sodexo In Flight Catering team, also at RAF Brize Norton, received a commendation after a busy year where they supported Op POLAR BEAR and the training of Ukrainian troops."
