These can be driven by a variety of factors, including sudden events, historic milestones and government announcements. GOV.UK\u2019s Data Insights team monitors these trends using tools such as Google Analytics, feedback and email subscription lists. This data, collected with a user\u2019s consent, gives us crucial guidance about what our users are looking for and how we can develop GOV.UK to continue to meet their needs in future."
