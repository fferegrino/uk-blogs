If you suspect your child has scarlet fever, contact your local GP. Stay away from nursery or school for 24 hours after the first dose of antibiotics."

            "text": "We are currently seeing the number of cases of measles and mumps increasing in all parts of the country. Measles in particular can be a very serious disease for some children and tragically it can even cause fatalities. The initial symptoms of measles are similar to those for a cold (runny nose; a cough; sneezing; a high temperature; and red, sore, watery eyes) this is followed by white spots in the mouth a few days later, and by a rash on the face and body a few days after that. It's very unlikely to be measles if your child has had both doses of the MMR vaccine or they\u2019ve had measles before. Viral infections such as\u00a0chickenpox\u00a0can also spread in schools at any time of year and are highly contagious. An itchy, spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox. It can be anywhere on the body."
