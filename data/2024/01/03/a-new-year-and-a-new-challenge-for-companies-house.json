We acted incredibly quickly to build this register which forms a key part of the government\u2019s strategy to tackle global economic crime. We saw the end of the transition period in January 2023, and there are now more than 30,000 entities on the register. More than 9,000 update statements have been filed so far, and we\u2019ve started issuing penalties to those who have not complied with the legislation. We won an Innovation (Excellence) Award from the Corporate Registers Forum (CRF) for our work on implementing the new register, and this international recognition was a particularly proud moment for me after such a busy year."

It\u2019s our people that make our culture, and our culture makes Companies House a great place to work."
