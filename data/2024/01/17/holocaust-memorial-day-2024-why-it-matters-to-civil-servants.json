Already 17, he was too old to be an official Kindertransport refugee, but travelled here with many of them from his home in Austria, fleeing Nazi persecution. Originally granted temporary leave to enter, he latterly became a British citizen, setting up a successful furniture business in Glasgow, marrying and raising his family there."

Colleagues at the very centre of Government heard the testimony of a Holocaust survivor, Steven Frank, alongside one from Eric Eugene Murangwa, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide (and, incidentally, a former international footballer)."

It remembers the millions of people killed in the Holocaust, Nazi Persecution and in subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur. In 2024, this coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the Rwandan Genocide."

            "text": "Remembering is more important than ever. People often invoke the platitude \u2018never again\u2019, but the point is that it has happened again in those more contemporary genocides. Hate continues to destroy and divide communities \u2013 right now, we are seeing massively increased levels of antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred on the streets of the UK. It damages the most vulnerable, and it undermines the fabric of society.\u00a0"

            "text": "And, yet, little more than ten years ago, the day was hardly marked at all in most Government departments. Spurred by this realisation, I worked with a group of inspirational colleagues across the Civil Service to build an HMD Champions network. And, in 2024, we now have almost thirty events taking place across every major Government department, as well as many of our agencies and arms\u2019 length bodies."

Most importantly, this includes survivors of the Holocaust. With each passing year, the opportunities to hear a survivor grow ever fewer. Those of us who have had that privilege bear an almost sacred responsibility to take up that mantle.\u00a0"

            "text": "Because acts like these can\u2019t simply be perpetrated by individuals - they rely on an organised, state-sponsored regime. So it is crucial for those of us in government to hear these testimonies, and to learn the lessons. Those lessons are uniquely powerful, can shape our world view, and continue to be key to so many of the things for which we are responsible.\u00a0"
