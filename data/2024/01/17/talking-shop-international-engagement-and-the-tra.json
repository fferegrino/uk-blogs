Thanks to the in-person technical exchanges we have held with colleagues from the US Department of Commerce Enforcement & Compliance and the US International Trade Commission, our relationships have been strengthened and we have identified areas where we can potentially refine our policies."

We have also had informative conversations with the Australian Dumping Commission (ADC) around WTO disputes."

            "text": "Sharing best practice works two ways. Just as we learn from our global counterparts on what has worked for them and what hasn\u2019t, we also seek to pass on our experience in specific aspects of our work. For example, we have been sharing our experience of creating a digital platform for our public file with the New Zealand trade remedies team who are hoping to create something similar and we have shared our experience in case specific issues and with challenges around industry engagement during cases."

In practice this means that, in collaboration with DBT, we are horizon scanning the latest international trade remedy developments and discussions, keeping abreast of what other countries are doing in this area. This helps us to assess the prospective effect of any developments on the UK\u2019s domestic industry and potential applications which may arise in a similar vein."
