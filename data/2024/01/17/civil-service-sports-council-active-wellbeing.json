Over 10,000 colleagues took part in 2023\u2019s challenge, and 2024 is set to be its biggest and most inclusive yet. CSSC\u2019s CEO Matt Bazeley, OBE, reflects on what sport means to him, and how he manages to balance the demands of a challenging job with staying active.\u00a0"

I was lucky enough to enjoy playing all of those sports until well into my 40s. I still play bad cricket and bad golf in my 50s!"

There's a local gym in my village that I go to and in the winter and in the summer I'll try and run. If it\u2019s a beautiful summer's morning in North Oxfordshire, that's not the worst way to start the day."

It's remarkable how you can dislocate from work just by going to the gym, taking the dogs for a walk, and in that time your brain works through things. You can put things in an order and it's constructive time. It might be away from work, but it has genuine work benefits."

The car is still the car, but you've had that opportunity to freshen things up a little bit. The oil and filters are a bit better and you've just got things running a little smoother in your head. It is amazing how often you reconcile a way ahead on a particularly crunchy problem by stepping away from actually confronting it."

We thoroughly celebrated the fact that last year we got a record number of civil servants participating, in excess of 10,000. If we were to get up towards 15,000, that would be a remarkable achievement. That said, any growth in the number of civil servants who are able to access and enjoy the benefits of the campaign would be a huge success for our perspective.\u00a0"

It doesn't matter what you do, just do something, and if that means you step away from your desk at lunchtime for half an hour, take the stairs instead of the lift, walk or roll one more tube, metro or bus stop further than usual that\u2019s great \u2013 it all counts.\u00a0"

The time you are able to give to that activity will pay enormous dividends when you re-engage with work and with your family, you will simply be in a better place."
