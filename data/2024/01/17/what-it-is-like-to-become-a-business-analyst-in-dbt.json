I had just pulled into the car park of a local store 2 days after attending the interview, when the call came through. To say I was over the moon is to put it mildly. After the call, I sat in the car to take it all in and BREATHE!! Within the hour, I had received a provisional offer by email. You see, before I applied for the role, I had stumbled on a blog highlighting DBT as a department that supported women to grow and flourish in tech. I wanted to be here, be a part of this dream civil service department.\u202fI had been in the private sector, but I genuinely wanted the benefits the Civil Service, especially DBT, offered. \u00a0"

It wasn\u2019t until I received the pre-employment check documents did I truly I believe I had got the job. That started my journey as a Business Analyst in the Department for Business and Trade and what a journey it\u2019s been.
