Meet Eleanor, a Business Admin who started the role when she was 18 years old. Currently at HMP/YOI Isis, she works in the Business Hub. The role of a Business Administrator has always fascinated her as her parents worked in the Prison Service."

Before starting, Eleanor also didn\u2019t know what department she would be going into. She says, \u201cit was interesting to find out that I\u2019d be in the finance department\u2026I didn\u2019t realise how much finance was involved in the prison service until joining.\u201d"

It always benefits people who have other things in their life.\u201d There are also great on-the-job training and progression opportunities."

We don't talk to customers but use this skill when speaking to other staff members and making sure that communication gets across to other departments.\u201d Before becoming a Business Admin, Eleanor was in various customer-facing roles which was useful experience to have. She says, \u201cyou have to be patient especially when explaining something to someone that is frustrated\u201d."

In my prison, we\u2019ve got an app called the biometrics, where prisoners can make requests on an electronic system, and we can answer them.\u201d The role involves a mix of administrative tasks, but this can vary depending on which department you are placed in, for example Eleanor is currently in the business hub and so deals \u201cwith a lot of finance, such as ordering. We also deal with PIN credit, which is something that prisoners get when they have money. It allows them to request money to go on their phone that\u2019s in their cell and that manually has to be done every day.\u201d"
