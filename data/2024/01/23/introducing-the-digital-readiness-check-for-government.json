Every day, in many different ways, we all play a part in turning policy into outcomes for citizens. And as the pace of technological advance continues to increase, digital and data-driven approaches will become ever more vital in delivering those policy priorities.\u00a0\u00a0"

It\u2019s also why the former Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jeremy Quin, spoke of the importance of modernising not just our technology estate, but also our processes, structures and ways of working in government in a speech last year at Policy Exchange. That includes the processes and techniques we use to make policy and legislation, and the ways we work across professional and functional lines to get to the right outcome."

To support this - working with colleagues across government and drawing on experience from overseas - the Central Digital and Data Office has developed a set of key principles and questions to work through when developing policy or legislation. We\u2019re calling it a Digital Readiness Check."

Policymakers might even be fairly confident a policy does not have a digital delivery dimension. But nearly everything we do in government nowadays will involve digital and data at some point - so there are a few key principles we all need to keep at the front of our mind when working up a new policy idea or initiative:"

We\u2019ll be writing more on this topic over the coming months. In the meantime, you can find the Digital Readiness Check online, and if you\u2019d like to discuss this topic we\u2019d love to hear from you - please get in touch at digitalfunction@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk."
