Too many forces outside our control can stymie these efforts, but social work remains a profession defined by its commitment to social justice."

So, we worked together to create a new (and hopefully better) book that describes citizenship from the perspective of people with learning disabilities. It also has wonderful illustrations by our Spanish colleague, Ester Ortega, and editorial guidance from the talented Clare Tarling, an expert in Easy Read."

Citizenship also demands we share the practical work of equipping each other with the stuff of citizenship. Some of these things may be obvious \u2013 help, money, home, community \u2013 but there are other things that may seem more difficult."

This means that some people need communication systems while others need systems of support and decision-making to liberate their agency. Social workers need to offer practical support to make sure people can express how they want to shape their lives."

We know that love is the fundamental stuff of life, we know that loneliness is a dangerous poison\u2014yet we struggle to accept that strengthening relationships is essential to good social work. It\u2019s often easier to focus on the practical help we organise."

A personal budget or a support package is meaningless unless it enables us to do something that\u2019s meaningful for us, and this is a very personal matter. What is meaningful for me won\u2019t be meaningful for you. This has always been at the heart of that rather over-used word \u201cpersonalisation\u201d."

It\u2019s also a guide for life, offering a vision where everyone has life that\u2019s well lived, equal and wonderfully unique. I hope social workers will read and share it with the fellow citizens they support."
