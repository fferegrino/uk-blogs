            "text": "As recommended by the election watchdog itself since at least 2014, we have introduced identification for voting in person across Great Britain, in line with the longstanding arrangements in Northern Ireland which has had photo identification to vote in elections since 2003."

            "text": "Showing ID to vote is a reasonable approach to combat the inexcusable potential for voter fraud in our current system. The Electoral Commission has previously called for \u2018sustained action\u2019 to prevent fraud from taking place."
        },
        {
            "text": "We disagree with the assessment that the ID scheme creates a barrier for some. The vast majority of voters in the polling station - 99.75% - cast their vote successfully at the local elections in England in May, following a number of successful pilots of this process in previous elections."
