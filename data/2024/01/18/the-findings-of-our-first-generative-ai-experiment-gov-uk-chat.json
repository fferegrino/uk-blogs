As Chris Bellamy writes: \u201cWe believe that there is potential for this technology to have a major, and positive, impact on how people use GOV.UK... [and] that the government has a duty to make sure it's used responsibly, and this duty is one that we do not take lightly.\u201d This echoes the government's recommended approach described in a policy white paper last year."

There were also some misunderstandings about how generative AI works. This could lead to users having misplaced confidence in a system that could be wrong some of the time. We\u2019re working to make sure that users understand inaccuracy risks, and are able to access the reliable information from GOV.UK that they need."
