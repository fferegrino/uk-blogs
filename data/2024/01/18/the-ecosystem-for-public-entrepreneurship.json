All driven by a team of passionate and skilled innovators of which I am proud to be a part."

            "text": "In essence, successful innovation in the public sector requires more than just skills in innovative techniques. Innovators must have a lot of self-awareness, as well as situational and contextual alertness, and a clear view of the ecosystem in which they are operating. This will help them draw on the supportive people and forces in the system and counteract the inherent immune response designed for continuity and stewardship, that predictably opposes creativity, change and innovation."

            "text": "As public servants we are often busy improving the public services that we oversee: sometimes policy makers need to rejuvenate or replace a policy because it is not delivering the anticipated or required outcomes; sometimes it will be to develop a new policy to address an emerging public need or in response to political direction. At a service delivery level, engaged operational managers are always looking for ways to improve services, reduce costs, correct failings in current services or to meet spikes in demand."

        {
            "text": "And I have a strong sense this is in the DNA of many of us and that throughout the public sector there are many dedicated public servants who are innovating in their own areas to improve the policies and services for which they have responsibility. Some of this will be within formal initiatives, but often it will be on their own initiative. In fact, I believe that every public servant has a duty to the citizens we serve to act in this way and should always be looking for ways to improve things."

            "text": "In no other sector is there a greater need for innovation, and in no other sector is it as hard to do! Just think of how complex it is. Consider the myriad of stakeholders. Consider the fact that much of what we do is because of market failure (we provide services to address needs that the market simply does not respond to because it is either too hard or not economically viable). Also consider that we are often trying to get people to do things they don\u2019t want to do, like paying taxes! Layer on top of that the unrelenting scrutiny and criticism of what we do. Public Service is not simple, it is challenging, it is difficult; and innovating within it is even more so! Framing innovation through the lens of the Enabling Ecosystem provides a solid basis upon which to innovate."

        {
            "text": "I like this definition because it shows that innovation is not predominantly about the invention of revolutionary products or services that radically changes things, like the iPad or the Dyson; rather, and for the most part, it is grounded in what is attainable by individuals within the span of their control, while working within a larger system."

In the iLab we always start with \u2018problem definition\u2019 to ensure effort is correctly targeted on the problem itself."

This is what I mean by the Enabling Ecosystem. In short, it is the combination of the components of the setting in which you are innovating; and it will have variations depending on the organisation itself and your position and authority within it."
