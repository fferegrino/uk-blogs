Throughout its evolution, the programme has undergone several transformations based on valuable learner feedback. Notable adjustments include shortening the scheme duration from four to three years and shifting postings to 12 months (so the scheme would offer three postings in total). The latest refinement involves a more targeted role offering, informed by evaluation feedback, strategic programme objectives, and the profession's evolving requirements, aligned with the core Fast Stream curriculum. The programme is currently focused on four of the most crucial and sought-after digital roles across government: business analyst, user researcher, product manager, and delivery manager."

This year, we introduced a digital, data, and technology bolt on component in collaboration with the Fast Stream Early Talent Team.
