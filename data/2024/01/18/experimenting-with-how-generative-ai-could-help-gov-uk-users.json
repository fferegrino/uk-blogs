            "text": "Recently, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about artificial intelligence (AI). In November, the Prime Minister held the AI Safety Summit with the world-first Bletchley Declaration, and shortly after there were further international agreements on AI knowledge sharing. The AI Safety Institute has also been established to focus on advanced AI safety for the public interest. So, it\u2019s clear the spotlight is on the opportunities and risks AI presents to governments \u2014 and what can be done collectively to use AI for good."

This builds on a decade of innovating with new technologies, including AI and machine learning, at GOV.UK. And it helps directly contribute to GDS\u2019s mission of improving and safeguarding the user experience of digital government."

However, we also know, as with all new technology, that the government has a duty to make sure it\u2019s used responsibly, and this duty is one that we do not take lightly."

            "text": "To make sure we were both investigating new technologies, while being cognisant to the risks, we decided the best way to understand how the new technology can deliver value is through real experiments, starting small and scaling incrementally. We\u2019ve set up the GOV.UK AI Team, which brings together a multidisciplinary team to design, build and run a series of experiments using AI that can be tested with a variety of different users."

We will always uphold our high standards when it comes to data protection, following privacy by design and data minimisation principles. We do this by methods that include removing GOV.UK pages with personal data from the tool; limiting the tool to invited users; instructing these testers not to input personal data; and screening inputs for personal data."

The creation of GOV.UK itself was an innovation over a decade ago - bringing together nearly 2,000 government websites into a single home for the UK government online. And since then the teams across GOV.UK have sought to take advantage of AI technologies to keep up with changing user expectations. For instance, we used algorithms for related links, machine learning to increase accessibility of the site and innovative data analysis during COVID-19."

We\u2019re working closely with colleagues across government, particularly in the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) and No.10, to ensure our experiments are conducted safely and securely. CDDO has published the Generative AI Framework today which sets out guidance for government departments on the safe, responsible and effective use of generative AI."

If you\u2019re interested in this work, we\u2019re looking for individuals and partners to join us on this programme of AI experiments, so please get in touch via govuk-enquiries@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk if you\u2019d like to be involved. We\u2019ll be recruiting full time Data Scientist, Data Engineer and more positions in the team as we build our capabilities in this area. Please search Civil Service Jobs to apply."
