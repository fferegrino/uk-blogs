You can \u2018license-out\u2019 to another company in return for a fee. You can \u2018license-in\u2019 if you want to use another company\u2019s IP to develop your own business and products. The person granting the licence is usually called the licensor, and the person receiving the licence is usually called the licensee.\u00a0"
