            "text": "Since 2010, over 2.5 million additional homes have been delivered, with the four highest annual rates of housing supply over the past 30 years all coming since 2018. There is more to do, but this record clearly shows a Government that is delivering its promise to build more homes. We are unwavering in our commitment to drive up housing supply across the country, backed by investment of \u00a310 billion."

            "text": "Just last month the Housing Secretary published the updated National Planning Policy Framework. This was part of a major intervention in the planning system to boost performance and hold poorly performing council planning departments to account, whose delays have held up house building in their area."

            "text": "The major planning intervention comes after the Housing Secretary set out the Long-Term Plan for Housing in July last year. This outlined a new era of regeneration, inner-city densification and housing delivery across England, including ambitious plans to deliver thousands of homes in the heart of Cambridge, Leeds and London, and \u00a313.5 million to establish a new \u2018super-squad\u2019 of planners to support large scale projects."
