            "text": "All of my roles, for the last 25 years, have involved working within the triangle of: customer needs, business objectives, and technology opportunities. If I had to put these in order, I would prioritise them in this way; without understanding customer needs (internal or external) it is difficult, if not impossible, to meet business objectives."
        },
        {
            "text": "Once you understand both of these, it is then possible to see how technology can be used to achieve the desired result - meet customer needs and achieve business objectives. Therefore, the strong focus on delivering customer needs is a really important element of continuous improvement, for me."

            "text": "Although projects and programmes are sometimes needed to kick-start and implement large scale change, I\u2019m a strong believer in a service orientated, continuously improving approach. Most strategic services will significantly outlast any project or programme that was initiated to create the service in the first place."
        },
        {
            "text": "Without continual iteration and improvement of the service it will become out-dated over time.\u00a0 It will likely no longer meet customer expectations, and may not be optimally achieving business objectives, outcomes, or policy intent. The underlying technology may become harder and more costly to support and become more vulnerable to cyber-attack."

        {
            "text": "Continuous improvement and iteration helps to mitigate these issues and move away from the IT system \u2018boom and bust\u2019 cycle. This can (and often does) happen when lots of money and effort is put into developing and implementing a new system, which is launched to great fanfare. \u00a0The project/programme team move onto something else, no continual improvement happens, and over time the systems become obsolete, and a new project/programme is stood up to replace the system. And then the whole cycle starts again!"

There are a few specific things that I, my senior leadership peers and wider colleagues hope to achieve from this focus on continuous improvement though, including:"

            "text": "Winston Churchill is famously reported to have once said \u201cTo improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.\u201d In that regard, we must always try to be realistic and acknowledge that progress isn\u2019t necessary a linear journey; yes, there will often be setbacks, it\u2019s important to be realistic about that."

            "text": "Ultimately our goal, through this focus on improvement, is to make continual improvement an integral part of the way we work, - something we all do. It shouldn\u2019t necessarily be an add-on, rather it should be a natural extension of our normal ways of working. For many it already is; the challenge is to tip the balance more in that direction because we want continuous improvement to become part of the DNA of our organisation, constantly seeking value at the lowest cost to the taxpayer while empowering and energising our staff."
