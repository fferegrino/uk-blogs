As more data becomes available on this variant, we\u2019ll have a better understanding of how it interacts with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection and as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible."

Their protection since their last vaccination will have waned and they remain at increased risk from a respiratory infection this winter. It\u2019s also important to note that COVID-19 isn\u2019t a special case; respiratory infections can be unpredictable, and we\u2019re asking similar groups to get vaccinated against flu."
