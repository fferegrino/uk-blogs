The USVs scanned the seabed to help identify features from depth and habitats, to ridges, boulders and shipwrecks."

At the event, our panel of experts discussed how, as we move towards fully autonomous ships, the traditional approach of humans on board using standard digital products will often no longer apply."

ENCs are used on board most large ships across the globe to enable safe passage from A to B. However, these have been specifically designed with the mariner in mind, meaning they are optimised for human interpretation \u2013 and are effectively constrained to include only the information that a mariner needs."

To help tackle this issue, the UK Hydrographic Office along with the MASS community is exploring potential solutions that utilise the latest technologies and S-100 \u2013 the International Hydrographic Organization\u2019s new data standard, which will support the next generation of navigational products and services and what these may look like for large ocean-going autonomous vessels."

When integrated with other data collections, this gridded bathymetry can significantly contribute to navigation and position determination for MASS, as demonstrated through the XOCEAN-led project. XOCEAN used the UKHO\u2019s ADMIRALTY ENC\u2019s to safely navigate the USVs whilst collecting the bathymetric data."

Without a crew on board, AI-powered cameras and onboard sensors enabled the Mayflower Autonomous Ship to cross from Plymouth UK to North America. By bringing together data from various sources, its onboard AI captain was able to perform a similar role to a human captain, constantly assessing the ship\u2019s route, status and mission."

This will foster innovation in the maritime sector by creating a lifelike environment to simulate a variety of scenarios that a mariner could feasibly encounter at sea. It will also enable the testing of new technologies for both crewed and uncrewed vessels and for researchers to study the effects of environmental change."

We have recently developed \u2018digital twins\u2019 of port environments, including Southampton and north-west Scotland, using a similar concept. These technologies could potentially serve as a robust tool for MASS navigation in coastal regions."
