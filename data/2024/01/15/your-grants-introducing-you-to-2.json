In this\u00a0series\u00a0of blogs, we look at the grants available in more detail, using case studies to showcase those who have taken advantage of these opportunities, as well as highlighting the work of the RPA Grants Service Team in administering them. In this blog we meet Jen Walker who works on the appraisal stage of grants."

My main role is to assess the full applications that come in through the Farming Transformation Fund (FTF) and make a recommendation on whether the grant should be approved or not, before passing it on to the next stage. I also carry out a \u2018sponsorship\u2019 role, which is when customers who\u2019ve been invited to full application stage are allocated a sponsor, such as myself, who are there to answer any queries they may have."

I like to pick up the phone to farmers and talk them through any queries they may have, giving them the correct information they need to apply for the grants that will help them develop and improve their business."

My husband and two sons, aged 11 and 15, are all fanatical Newcastle United supporters, and season ticket holders. One son is a referee, both play on a Sunday and my husband coaches, so my whole life is scheduled around them. Obviously I do it for them, but don\u2019t tell anyone \u2013 I\u2019m not that interested in football - I\u2019d rather be shopping!"

But in winter, when the weather isn\u2019t very good, in my spare time I like to sew small items like bags and bunting and then give them to charity. I used to sew as a child but lost interest in my 20s but I\u2019ve discovered it again and it\u2019s wonderful."
