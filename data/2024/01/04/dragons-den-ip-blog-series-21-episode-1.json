            "text": "The Stand Out team retails brightly coloured, premium, unisex socks \u2013 but these are socks with a difference. This business idea was inspired by co-founder Ross, a young man with Down Syndrome. The team developed their sock business to increase awareness of Down Syndrome and provide employment opportunities and financial independence for individuals with learning disabilities.\n"

The team\u2019s proposition is to provide stylish, personalised eyewear in double quick time from kiosks sited within shopping parks."

            "text": "Daniel explained that the idea of kiosks in retail locations is that it saves on high rents. That helps to keep the price point low, which in turn helps to attract impulse purchasers. Shoppers can present their prescription, make their frame choice, pay their \u00a350 and be back in 20 minutes to collect their glasses."

It was when she mentioned the 3 to 4 month payback time for the set-up cost of a new kiosk - \u00a360,000 for the kiosk and \u00a320,000 for the equipment \u2013 that the Dragons\u2019 eyes truly started popping."

Deborah and Steven declared themselves out of the frame, however, leaving the pair with an offer from Dragons Peter Jones, Touker Suleyman and Sara Davies. Each agreed to take a 4% stake in the business for a combined \u00a375,000."
