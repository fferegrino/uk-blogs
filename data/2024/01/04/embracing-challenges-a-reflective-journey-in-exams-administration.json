Fast forward to the present, and we have been through another summer exam series, processed and released results to learners, dealt with new registrations, and concluded the autumn re-sits."

            "text": "It only proves the point I was trying to make \u2013 that our roles are as varied as they are challenging. Looking back at what we have achieved and how far we have come in just a few short months proves my other point \u2013 that our roles can be incredibly rewarding. The last academic year was full of new challenges and new opportunities."

            "text": "Reflecting on the past academic year, I admit it was tough at times for our exams office team at Newcastle College. However, there is a sense of pride and delight in the improvements we have made. Successfully delivering exam series and ensuring timely results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our entire team, supported by our leadership, quality assurance, curriculum, admin, and learner support teams. This is another element of my earlier blog \u2013 collaboration with others, which I will focus on this time around too."

            "text": "Welcoming new team members to our team prompted me to focus on equipping them with the tools and knowledge needed to excel in their roles. I know from my own experience (and I hear this all the time from other exams officers) that it is exceptionally rare to have an opportunity of shadowing an experienced exams officer. This lack of meaningful handover is not unique to exams teams, but it seems more pronounced, possibly due to the unique demands of the role."

        {
            "text": "We sometimes hear that new exams officers can experience especially tough times at the beginning, but with each exams series we learn to love our work. It is, therefore, hugely important for both new and experienced exams officers and SLT to take up awarding organisation training; training that supports us in understanding our roles and awarding organisations\u2019 requirements. I have previously emphasised the pride and joy exams officers take in their roles once they become accustomed to the expectations. Here are my insights into what worked well for me, and I hope you find them useful if you are a new exams officer."

Even if you\u2019ve stepped into the role midway through the academic year, I would encourage you to take the time to go through the following tasks.

Ofqual\u2019s recent updates on the Delivery of VTQ results for 2024 and beyond reflect a commitment to addressing difficulties faced by exams officers. Changes include better dates for term-time checkpoints, advance release of results, and enhanced communication strategies."
