I\u2019m Beth McAdam, and in today\u2019s programme, we deep dive into the range of grant offers currently available to farmers, providing guidance on the application process, as well as key dates and criteria for applicants to be aware of. We also speak to Jim Bubb, a recent recipient of the Farming Transformation Fund, to find out how this grant has benefitted his business. And finally, we will discuss how the recently launched Rural Land Changes digital service could benefit your business."

Joining me today to give an overview of the range and type of grants available, is Danielle Bragg from the RPA Grants Service Team, who administer the available grants.

        },
        {
            "text": "Danielle: Absolutely, so, grants exist to address specific one-off needs within the farm. The type of grants we offer, as part of the Farming Investment Fund, specifically focus on investments in equipment, technology, and infrastructure that improves farm productivity and benefits the environment."

        {
            "text": "Danielle: Yes, of course, so initially the Farming Investment Fund is broken up into two parts. For smaller grants, there is the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund (FETF), that provides grants between \u00a31,000 and \u00a325,000, dedicated towards the cost of specific items of equipment and technology to improve productivity, the environment and animal health and welfare."

The FETF is currently closed for applications, but we expect there will be further opportunities launched this year \u2013 2024 - including new items \u2013 so applicants should keep an eye out for those!"

        },
        {
            "text": "Danielle: The bigger grants are covered by the Farming Transformation Fund. That provides grants from \u00a325,000 all the way up to \u00a3500,000! This fund is dedicated towards large capital items to help businesses improve productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability."

            "text": "Danielle: There are currently five competitive grant schemes under the Farming Transformation Fund. These are slurry infrastructure; Adding Value; Water Management; Improving Farm Productivity and Calf Housing for Health and Welfare. These grants are all currently in different stages, some are in the online checker phase, taking on new potential applications which is stage 1 of the application process, while others are accepting full applications from those invited to apply, which is stage 2 of the application process.\u00a0 And our Development Team are also looking at potential new grants and further rounds of existing grants."

        },
        {
            "text": "Danielle: This checker is new for Farming Investment Fund and has been created to streamline the application process and replace the paper applications we had previously. This is an online service that only takes a short time and asks for basic information such as type of business, how many hectares the farm is, details of the planned project and what sort of grant is being applied for. This service can then instantly tell a business owner if they are eligible to apply for a grant. And once the window for stage 1 applications closes it also enables the team to make quicker decisions on who to invite to submit a full application."
        },
        {
            "text": "Only projects that have submitted an online application through the online checker and have been given a reference number will be able to submit a full application; as this is a longer process that involves gaining quotes and planning permissions, so it is essential to receive an invite before proceeding with this."

            "text": "Danielle: Yes, absolutely, so these grants are all different sizes and are aimed at different kinds of businesses, so, I will take a minute here to set each of these out and make clear what is coming up for each."

We are currently overseeing two rounds of this. Applicants who were invited to submit a full application for Round 1 have until 28 June 2024 to do this. We have also launched a second round of this grant and we will soon be inviting those who were successful at the online checker phase to submit full applications."

            "text": "Danielle: For Calf Housing and Welfare, the window to use the online checker closed on 30 November last year \u2013 this grant has been made available for farmers in the beef and dairy sector, who can apply for grants between \u00a315,000 and \u00a3500,000 to build new, or refurbish existing calf housing. This grant aims to improve the health and welfare of calves up to six months old.\u00a0 We\u2019re in the process of reviewing the online applications and people have been asked to submit Ambient Environment Assessments.\u00a0 These need to be with us by 30th April and will then be able to invite successful applicants to full application stage."

The Adding Value grant is currently open to full applications for those who have been invited to submit an application, \u2013 these full applications will be accepted up until 31 January 2024, so we would encourage anyone still to submit this month to do so as soon as possible!"

            "text": "Danielle: This grant is designed for growers or producers to improve farm productivity through more efficient use of water for irrigation, and to secure water supplies for crop irrigation by the construction of on-farm reservoirs and the adoption of best practice irrigation application equipment.\u00a0This scheme provides funding between \u00a335,000 and \u00a3500,000. Round two of this grant is currently accepting full applications from those who have received an invitation to apply and correlating reference number and applicants will have until 31 October 2024 to submit this application."

We\u2019ve recently launched another round of this grant and the online checker is expected to open later this month. This grant is split into two parts, both focused on improving productivity through either:"
        },
        {
            "text": "Beth: And I believe an entirely new grant, that is not part of the Farming Investment Fund, was launched in December, are you able to provide some more detail on this?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Danielle: Yes, that was the Small Abattoir Fund. This is a new \u00a34million fund that is being made available to support smaller red meat and poultry abattoirs to enhance sustainability and efficiency, as well as encouraging innovation and improving animal welfare standards. This fund will provide grants between \u00a32,000 and \u00a360,000 and is now open to applications. The application window will remain open for nine months and abattoirs will be able to submit up to three applications up to the maximum funding level of \u00a360,000. A diverse list of capital investments has been developed in close consultation with industry stakeholders and we have emailed all eligible smaller abattoirs directly outlining the application process."

        },
        {
            "text": "Danielle: Yes, a farmer can be a recipient of a number of grants to cover all different elements of the farm so we would encourage everyone to take a look at what\u2019s available when thinking about developing their business. Also, when we launch new schemes, we publish detailed guidance on who can apply and the minimum and maximum amount you can request so it's always a good idea to read the guidance fully before you start to make an application."

            "text": "Jim: So, we applied for the FTF grant, back in March 2022, and after passing the initial stages we were successful in our bid for the purchase of two farm droid robots. The grant process took a few months, and it wasn't until December 2022 when we were successful in our application. The droids were ordered straight away, and they were on the farm by March 2023, where this year they have just completed their first year, drilling and managing twenty hectares of flowers - where they have weeded and drilled the field completely using solar power."

            "text": "Can see that we could potentially have a swarm of robots in the years to come, I'm not quite sure how it will work, but we have to accept technology is here to stay and we have to embrace it and help evolve and make it useful for the future. So, at the end of the day, they work solely off solar power, they can run 24/7, they don\u2019t need a break, their accuracy is ten times more than any tractor \u2013 so there's definitely a future in this sort of machinery."
        },
        {
            "text": "Beth: That\u2019s brilliant! So, this machinery has changed the way you\u2019re working quite a bit then?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Jim: It\u2019s certainly made us look at it in a different light, definitely Beth. It\u2019s in theory, very simple \u2013 it's a combination of three or four different bits of technology that have come together to automate a process in the field which is definitely saving us labour and increasing the quality of product that we are able to grow."
        },
        {
            "text": "Back in the end of 2021 and 2022, we were faced with the fact that there is a potential shortage of labour out there and hand weeding the crop, at that time, was quite a major role that we had to carry out and, with this risk of not having labour available to us, we had to look at different ways that we could try to automate and bring technology to the forefront. So, these two robots have the ability to drill the field and automatically weed the field itself, so it's taken our weeding bill from circa \u00a320,000 plus down to nearly \u00a35,000 in one year alone."
        },
        {
            "text": "Beth: Thats brilliant! And how else has this benefited your business?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Jim: Well, the machines have increased the accuracy and the quality of the flowers we\u2019re growing, so we\u2019ve seen some improvement in the yield and, with the increased accuracy of weeding, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our use of herbicide that we apply to it, so we\u2019re using less of that which is a good thing. And the robots run purely off solar power so, just form that point of view alone, the fact that we are using less fossil fuel is definitely advantageous to us."

We\u2019re looking at installing a new processing facility, here on the farm, that will help us push the business forwards, looking at new products that we can utilise our flower petals for and giving us a new area that we can more efficiently dispatch our products from, to ensure we can get the end product to the consumers at the best price possible."

            "text": "Rachael: These changes are important because, as a farmer, keeping your digital maps up to date is a key aspect of how you apply for schemes. It will enable farmers to quickly inform us of mapping changes ahead of any application they may wish to make, for example Sustainable Farming Incentive or Countryside Stewardship, which require mapping to be correct before you can apply. These changes will allow farmers to begin their applications sooner."

We\u2019ll also look to make changes to the paper RLE1 form at the beginning of this year, making it easier for you to complete.\u00a0We\u2019ll also remove the option to email RLE1s to us as the online service replaces this function, but we will provide further information on this soon."
