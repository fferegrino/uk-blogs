Our network is geographically located in Nottinghamshire, but we have members across the East Midlands, including Derbyshire and Leicestershire."

We actively encourage new SBPs to reach out to us if they are looking for a mentor within our community."

If the theme of an event might suit a colleague rather than a member, let them know. Our membership allows for you to send someone else to attend in your place. It is not unusual for a head teacher or another school professional to attend in place of the ABLE member at one of our termly conferences or training half days."

We try to tailor our network events so that members shouldn\u2019t have to justify their absence from school. Instead, we like to think they need an excellent reason for not attending our events!"

Your fellow SBPs can understand the ups and downs of the job in a way that other colleagues in your school cannot and you will reap the benefits of being able to share your problems and experiences, and learn from one another."
