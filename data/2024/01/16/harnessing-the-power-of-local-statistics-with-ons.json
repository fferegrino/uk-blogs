It complements a wider project where they are developing more insights at lower levels of geography such as towns, and at a building block level so that users can define the area of interest. They also continue to lead across government on UK wide coherence of data.\u00a0"

Therefore, ONS has not only developed the tools, but has established an analytical advisory service supporting local government across the English regions and the Devolved Administrations in accessing and making the best use of local data. It has dedicated analysts based across the UK, ensuring those locally have access to data, statistics, and analysis to support decision making.\u00a0"

This work provided local policymakers with enough evidence to make the case for investment in small businesses and drive local employment."
