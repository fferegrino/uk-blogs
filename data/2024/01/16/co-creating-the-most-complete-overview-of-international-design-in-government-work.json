To co-create the most complete snapshot of public sector design in the world, we reached out to community members everywhere to express their interest in the format and submit topics they would like to contribute. We had over 550 registered attendees and 61 speakers representing 25 countries, nations and territories."

Since starting the community and running the first events, we have gathered for multi-day conferences, shared our work in remote calls, and collected the viewpoints of people in all parts of the world. For this event, we wanted to bring these three aspects together in a single format.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The topics were broad \u2013 ranging from accessible services to co-created policies. We heard from vice ministers, chief design officers, accessibility specialists, content, service, UX designers, and user researchers. From city and state to federal and central government, we saw the broadest range of human-centred design practices: from visual to experience to service to policy design. In addition, several speakers emphasised the importance of building community and global collaboration; and dealing with disillusionment and celebrating small victories."

In October, complementing the Service Design Network (SDN) Global Conference in Berlin, we invited public servants in town for a community afternoon gathering ahead of the main event."

Around 20 people from four nations and seven organisations took part in the event with talks, breakout discussions and exchanges. Germany\u2019s Digital Service shared some of their work on designing principles for digital-ready legislation and co-designing with federal court staff. In multiple breakout rounds, we discussed voted-on topics like the role of \u2018delight\u2019 in using public services, skills designers need in emerging areas, or how to play back experience from service to policy. All slides from the afternoon are available on GitHub."

We then presented 5 recipes for people transforming end-to-end services. These respond to the notion that designing public services is not a sprint, but a baton relay ultramarathon. They recognise that services aren\u2019t designed by one group of people, but by multiple generations of teams.\u00a0"
