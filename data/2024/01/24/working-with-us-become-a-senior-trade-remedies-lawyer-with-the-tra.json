I worked on negotiations for the tax chapters of the TCA as well as free trade agreements with Australia and EFTA, and carried out advisory work on various customs issues including working on the Northern Ireland Protocol/Windsor Framework. So, even though I\u2019d never worked directly on trade remedies, it made sense for me to move here for the next step of my career.\u00a0"

It\u2019s still such a new area for the UK we\u2019ve all got a lot to learn. Everyone\u2019s aware of that too, so there is a real emphasis on training and upskilling. \u00a0"

It\u2019s been great to be involved with such a big project from the start, and to work with such a high-profile company like JCB. I even got to join investigators on a site visit to their manufacturing plant in Uttoxeter, which was a real early highlight for me.\u00a0\u00a0"

However, when I found out the expectation for the legal team was to come in at minimum once a week, that felt manageable from a work/life balance perspective. Of course, some people come in more than that \u2013 there\u2019s a real emphasis on finding what works for the individual and I\u2019ve always felt like I have control over my schedule here. The whole team aims to come in on Tuesday, which is great because I get to see people in person more than I did where I worked before, where the team was more spread out. These Tuesdays have really helped us to get to know each other and work well together.\u00a0"
