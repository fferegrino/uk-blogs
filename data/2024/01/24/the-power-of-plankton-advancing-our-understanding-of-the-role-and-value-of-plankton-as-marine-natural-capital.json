The evidence generated will feed into Defra's Marine Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment Programme (mNCEA) helping policymakers to understand the value of plankton as an important source of marine natural capital."

            "text": "Often called \u2018the drifters of the oceans\u2019 due to their limited ability to propel themselves, plankton are a diverse collection of organisms including phytoplankton (plankton capable of photosynthesis), zooplankton (animal plankton), and bacterioplankton (bacteria). They range over many sizes, and whilst the majority are very small, and not able to be seen by the naked human eye, they also include large organisms such as jellyfish. As the base of the food web, plankton provide a crucial food source to many small and large animals like fish and whales. Phytoplankton are also critical for the global carbon cycle, helping to regulate carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and through photosynthesis, generate around half of the world\u2019s oxygen. Despite their small individual size, changes in plankton communities often operate across very large spatial scales, impacting the entire marine food web."

            "text": "Some human activities, particularly those which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, input nutrients into the ocean, or extract biomass from the ocean (e.g. fishing), can negatively impact the state of pelagic habitats and their ability to provide these ecosystems services. For example, rising temperatures and increased nutrient pollution have been linked to harmful algal blooms (HABs) that can have huge impacts on marine biodiversity, resulting in economic losses for the seafood industry and tourism."

Pelagic habitat assessments carried out to support the UK Government\u2019s UK Marine Strategy\u00a0and Environmental Improvement Plan 2023, and at a regional sea scale through\u00a0OSPAR are used by governments to regulate human activities which negatively impact the marine environment. Observing and understanding changes to plankton abundance and community structure is therefore key to assessing the health of our marine environment."

            "text": "Biodiversity indicators have a history of use in the assessment of marine mammals, seabirds, and fish; however, it has not been easy to integrate pelagic habitat indicators into a routine assessment process. Assessing pelagic habitats is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to divide up the open ocean into discrete geographic areas (since there are no clearly defined boundaries in the open ocean), limited data coverage (a significant proportion of UK waters are under-surveyed, particularly for zooplankton), and a lack of agreement on what constitutes a \u201chealthy\u201d state."

        {
            "text": "Until recently, it has also been challenging to generate the necessary public and policy support to incorporate plankton and pelagic habitats into routine marine biodiversity assessments. This oversight has likely stemmed from a general lack of appreciation for the important ecosystem services plankton provide, since their contributions to water quality regulation, food webs and global climate are difficult to observe or understand. To help overcome some of these challenges, we now consider pelagic habitats in the context of the human dimension, representing a new way of thinking which is now central to all the work this expert group produces."

            "text": "The UK\u2019s Pelagic Habitats Expert Group has developed an indicator that assesses changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. This biodiversity indicator quantifies change in time-series of both plankton and environmental data to identify and understand changes in plankton community dynamics. It measures the functional diversity in the plankton community, through examining the abundance of groups of plankton that share a similar functional role within their environment. By assessing plankton as functional groups, rather than as individual species, we can identify important changes which can impact other components of the food web. This indicator has been used to assess pelagic habitat biodiversity status at the UK and OSPAR levels, and the outputs can help scientists and policymakers further their understanding of how the marine food web is changing in response to human pressures."

This work also forms the basis for pelagic habitats assessment under the UK Marine Strategy."

These long-term trends have largely continued through 2015-2019, and are expected to continue, eventually impacting higher food web levels. Due to these widespread changes which have been linked to pressures generated by human activities, pelagic habitats in the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast all have a status which is considered \u201cnot good\u201d."

Valuing plankton through a \u2018natural capital\u2019 approach can help us understand the societal, cultural, and economic value of these goods and services to society. With Defra\u2019s support, we will work to strengthen the UK\u2019s capacity for pelagic habitats monitoring, conduct empirical research on how human pressures are impacting pelagic habitats, and generate science communication outputs to help promote the natural capital value of pelagic habitats to relevant stakeholders and the public. Finally, with the evidence and tools generated under the programme, we hope to help policymakers consider the costs and benefits associated with different conservation and management approaches to safeguard the health of our seas."
