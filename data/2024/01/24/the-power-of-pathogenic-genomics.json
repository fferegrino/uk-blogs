            "text": "Pathogen genomics involves examining the genetic material of microorganisms that cause diseases.\u00a0 We can analyse genomes to identify harmful mutations or variations in a pathogen compared to known strains. This will allow us to detect drug resistance or other characteristics, such as those associated with severity, within a pathogen. By using genomic data, we can track the spread of infections and outbreaks. Additionally, pathogen genomics helps in the development and discovery of new vaccines and therapeutics, playing a crucial role in combating diseases and safeguarding our health."

It demonstrated the science's real-time impact on public health globally, by detecting and monitoring outbreaks; determining the effectiveness of interventions and by allowing us to adapt the global pandemic response."

            "text": "Since 2014, over 1 million genomes from routine hospital samples, outbreak investigations, environmental and food samples, and dedicated surveillance projects, have been sequenced by UKHSA and its legacy organisations. To date, the UK has uploaded 3,138,941 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to GISAID through collaborative partnerships between UKHSA, public health agencies in the devolved nations, NHS, academic and industry partners. The proactive sharing of genomic sequences in the public domain has made UKHSA an integral player in collaborative outbreak investigations across various agencies and countries. Last year, for example, global sequence data were used to rapidly identify a novel COVID-19 variant with unusual mutations, and once identified allowed us to quickly track and control local outbreaks."

The Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU) at UKHSA pioneered the first service for genome-based surveillance and tracking of bacterial variants causing gastrointestinal infections. This marked an early shift from traditional laboratory methods to genomic analysis."

The early detection of this outbreak and routine surveillance with WGS were instrumental in linking the outbreak to specific products, allowing for prompt and effective intervention. This technology has enabled rapid and decisive actions like food recall notices, which may previously have been delayed. Now, outputs from WGS help provide a robust evidence base to swiftly remove and recall hazardous products."

This has halved the time from TB detection to understanding the effective drugs from 6 to 12 weeks to approximately 2 to 4 weeks in the vast majority of cases.\u00a0 This is particularly important where individuals have drug-resistant infections, to both improve the opportunity to cure the individual and prevent drug-resistant TB infections spreading in the community by effectively targeting rapid public health interventions."
