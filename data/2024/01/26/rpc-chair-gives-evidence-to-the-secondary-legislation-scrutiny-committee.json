Stephen flagged that in 2023, the RPC issued \u2018Initial Review Notices\u2019 for around 40% of Final IAs, although when resubmitted the vast majority of these were then assessed as fit-for-purpose. In addition, Stephen noted that departments are still failing to produce PIRs on time, with less than 4 in every 10 regulations having a timely PIR (if they have one at all)."
