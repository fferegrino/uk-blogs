Nick highlighted the need for all delivery to become \u2018digital-by-default\u2019, optimising all of our operations through the use of more sophisticated technology, data analytics, and AI. He added that with sector productivity lagging and the impacts of climate change amplifying, we must \u201cstart to collaborate differently, work differently, take carbon out of infrastructure-build in significant amounts, and do things significantly more productively\u201d."

These roundtables brought together leading changemakers from across government and industry, with TIP LIVE acting as a platform through which journeys of collective action were launched. Since TIP LIVE 3, roundtables have been setting and assigning key actions, with progress updates anticipated at Interchange, an annual transport conference, in February.
