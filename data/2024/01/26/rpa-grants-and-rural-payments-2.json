In this series about grants and the team that delivers them on the RPA blog we look at the grants available, using case studies to showcase those who have taken advantage of these opportunities, as well as highlighting the work of the RPA Grants Service Team in administering them. In this blog, Donna Medd from Grants Service talks about a recent trip the team made to LAMMA."

We had some great discussions with manufacturers on a number of FETF funded items including a dribble bar (used for the application of slurry), a closed transfer system (used to manage crop protection and nutrition), a cattle squeeze crush and a hydraulic crush (used for the safe handling of cattle) a direct drill (used to place seed directly into the residues of the previous crop with minimal soil disruption). All of these items are funded via our FETF programme."

We\u2019ve had two rounds of this scheme \u2013 Round 1 was for general items and Round 2 was split into two application windows with items relating to Productivity and Slurry and items on Animal Health and Welfare.
