Innovation is, at its core, about not accepting the 'way things are', and doing something about it. The book is a bit dated now (and management buzzword heavy... \u2018synergise\u2019, anyone?) but I believe its core messages stand the test of time."

In this case, that's in order to survive on Mars, which is not so applicable to me at the moment, but who knows what the future holds?\u00a0"

This is not a theoretical or management consultancy book on innovation but a collection of lived experiences of delivering innovation in a range of context written in an engaging and readable format. I think anyone involved in delivering innovation within a complex organisation will find something of use in this book.\u00a0"

It does not tend to flourish when someone sits in a darkened room pondering their own precious thoughts.\u00a0 The message is that it is good to talk and don\u2019t expect to leap out of the bath very often."

            "text": "Resolving Conflict by Shay and Margaret McConnon. Incidentally, I also swear by this book. This is certainly not about innovation, but to innovate one needs a mixture of human beings, inevitably they will have different needs and so conflict is reasonably likely to arise.\u00a0 Letting conflict grow is destructive, running away from it will force people into comfortable bubbles and neither is ideal for innovation. I love this set of techniques as an underpinning innovation skill."

It finds that the behaviours that impede change often serve other important interests, such as assuaging deep-set anxieties \u2014 a bit like an overactive immune system. Making sustainable changes requires teams and individuals to address these root causes of resistance, and the book gives some useful guidance on how to do so."
