The outcome of this work is the new Procurement Act 2023 which is set to take effect in October 2024. This means changes in procurement regulation and practices, aimed at bringing about a more flexible, strategic approach to public procurement."

They place value for money, public benefit, transparency and integrity at the heart of our procurement system and will modernise and unify our systems and processes. The reforms will get tough on underperforming suppliers, and exclude those who pose an unacceptable risk."

It will introduce a new regime that is based on value for money, competition and objective criteria in decision-making. It will create a simpler and more flexible commercial system that better meets the country\u2019s needs, and it will more effectively open public procurement to new entrants such as small businesses and social enterprises, so that they can compete for - and win - more public contracts."
