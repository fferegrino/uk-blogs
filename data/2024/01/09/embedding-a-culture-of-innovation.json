Innovation can be abstract and we want to highlight how important culture is in fostering psychological safety and behaviours to innovate. In this article, we\u2019ll demystify how you can put innovation into action."

We\u2019ll be showcasing examples across the Civil Service for you to learn from on our blog during January and February. "

The Innovation Masterclass for current and future leaders has focused on upskilling senior leaders in how to foster an environment to support innovation in their teams."

To truly embed innovation into the wiring of departments and teams, we need to ensure the right infrastructure, systems and processes are in place to incentivise and support innovation. This could mean streamlining cumbersome business case processes, promoting schemes to capture and evaluate staff ideas, formalising the use of pilots to test new ideas before you scale them, and recognising and rewarding innovative behaviour in our performance management."

It\u2019s a complex endeavour requiring complementary initiatives and processes underpinned by people feeling empowered to raise new ideas and challenge the status quo. Building an innovative Civil Service is about both understanding the enabling conditions to foster creativity and collaboration, and having the infrastructure and processes to iterate, deliver and scale the best ideas."
