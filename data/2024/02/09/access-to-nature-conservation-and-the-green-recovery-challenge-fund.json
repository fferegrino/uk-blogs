In this blog post, we'll delve into the incredible achievements this fund has delivered over its 3-year lifespan as well as some of my personal reflections. I'm Zelda Baveystock, head of Green Recovery Challenge Fund Delivery at the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and I've been involved in a number of Defra related projects.\u00a0"

The fund remarkably contributed to the planting of over 1.7 million trees across 693 sites. This marks a substantial step towards mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects.\u00a0"

It supported over 2,600 jobs both directly and indirectly through spending on goods and services. Critically, it also encouraged organisations to forge new delivery partnerships. The combination of new jobs, job retention, training and partnership working has had a positive impact on the resilience of many of the funded organisations, enhancing their capacity for future nature recovery activity.\u00a0"

Through the projects\u2019 in-person and online events, it successfully connected more than 400,000 individuals with nature. Beyond the numbers, I have met many people who felt GRCF genuinely changed their lives for the better, providing opportunities to get outdoors, reconnect and develop new skills during a difficult time for all.\u00a0"
