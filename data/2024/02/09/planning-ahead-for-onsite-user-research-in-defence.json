A big part of my job involves being on site and from experience, there are three important things to consider when planning for onsite user research (UR):"

However, identifying and connecting with participants from one of the three frontline commands (FLCs, i.e. the Army, Royal Navy and RAF) can take a long time. In fact, this initial task is often regarded as the most demanding aspect of organising UR in Defence."

Therefore, setting aside a generous amount of time in your research plan to allow for this is advisable."

            "text": "It is worth noting that people\u2019s rank and duties inform their perspective on matters. For example, a signals regiment will collectively focus on comms however senior officer will offer a more strategic outlook whilst lower ranks, in contrast, will have a more hands-on view of the world. Hence, it is important to consider the purpose for your research as this will inform what role(s) you target in your UR."
