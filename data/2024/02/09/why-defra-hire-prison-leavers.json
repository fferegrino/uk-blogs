Their prison background is shared openly with their manager, but understandably they have chosen to keep it private from colleagues. So, every time they have been assigned a new manager they have been anxious about how their background will be perceived. Any question about their performance added to their fear they aren\u2019t trusted. Their many professional achievements have been secured alongside a much greater personal journey to believe that they can be a valued team member."

            "text": "You may wonder why we have prison leavers working in the Civil Service? To me the case is clear. Each year, in England and Wales, approximately 45,000 people will return to society after their sentence. Prison leavers have much lower levels of employment than the general population: just 30.4% of people released from custody will be in employment 6 months after their release. Unfortunately, around 23%-31% will reoffend within two years. Meaningful and stable employment can support an ex-offender\u2019s rehabilitation journey back into society: it has a direct effect on reducing reoffending."

            "text": "Employers overwhelmingly find that prison leavers are motivated, trustworthy, loyal and reliable. And leading companies in the private sector have been employing prison leavers for years. In my view, the Civil Service must have a role to play in providing roles for prison leavers. Fiona Ryland, Government Chief People Officer agrees and has been promoting prison leaver recruitment across Government - Prison Leaver Recruitment in the Civil Service\u00a0"
