Indeed, as an Exeter City fan, going green is often the last thing on my mind (apologies for the reference that the vast majority of people reading this probably won\u2019t get if they don\u2019t have a knowledge of lower league football rivalries!) However, I am passionate about doing the right thing and just wanted to share some of the work we're doing in RPA to embed sustainability in everything we do and show how everyone can play their part."

From the schemes we administer to the offices we work in, from our travel to our procurement, from our governance to our behaviours, all of these have sustainability ambitions at the heart of them."

More and more, this money is being paid to support farming in a way that benefits the environment and mitigates the impacts of climate change. Whether it\u2019s our IT or the procurement of services and items, all these corporate services functions have sustainability focused policies and processes in place."

            "text": "In RPA we recently successfully trialled the Greener Stationery Items catalogue on behalf of the whole of Defra and have now implemented use of this. We\u2019re decarbonising our travel by providing electric vehicles for our travelling field officers and encouraging the use of rail travel wherever possible for travel on official business. Sustainability plays a key part in our governance and all changes to existing processes or new strategies that go to our Directors for agreement require the sustainability impacts to be documented."

            "text": "Acting sustainably is also referenced in our performance standards for our staff and we\u2019re building on this by actively encouraging everyone who works at RPA to think about their behaviours and make changes to their actions. All of our Directors sponsor a sustainability-related theme and work with staff networks to help us make progress and increase awareness in these areas."

And it\u2019s that sense of collective responsibility and how we can all play our part that will really help us to start making a difference."
