Under this partnership, SANCCOB, an NGO that specialises in seabird and oiled wildlife response, held a 3-day Oiled Wildlife Response Training Programme in Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka in early February 2024. The programme was attended by 2 Assistant Directors, 10 Wildlife Rangers, 5 Ranger Assistants who are responsible for the management of protected areas, and 3 vets who are responsible for the treatment of wildlife, from the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka. They were joined by 10 national environmental experts from local NGOs, other Government agencies and academia, who also presented their knowledge and expertise on the local environment and species."

            "text": "The training equipped participants with the skills, knowledge and confidence to respond to the initial phase of an oil spill and attend to affected wildlife including seabirds, marine mammals and turtles before specialist responders arrive on the scene. An overview of operations, requirements and resources needed during the initial phase of a response was provided before participants were able to gain practical experience. Participants donned full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used during an oiled wildlife response, and learnt about the toxic nature of pollutants, and the importance of personal safety as a responder."

The course ended with an overview of lessons learned from different case studies and how these could be applied to Sri Lanka."
