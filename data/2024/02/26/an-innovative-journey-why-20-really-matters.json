At the Met Office, it is crucial that our (often life-saving) science and services are easily accessed by as many people as possible, to help them make better decisions to stay safe and thrive. Through our submission to Project Spark! we saw the opportunity to help drive improvement on a larger scale across government too."

Our idea 'Accessible by default \u2013 why 20% really matters!' outlined that 1 in 5 people in the UK have a disability that affects internet and social media use. \n\nWe gathered a small team from across the Met Office to work on our proposal. We ran idea generation sessions, collated inspiration and best practices and worked together, often virtually, on our pitch.We spoke to representatives from our own Accessibility Working Group, and with Peter Serjent, Strategy and Planning Theme Lead, from the central GCS team who sponsored our idea."
