        {
            "text": "After a bubbly entrance, Gemma showcased her business, potato-based greetings cards, looking for an investment of \u00a350k for a 10% stake. With stockists including Pets at Home and Aldi, the Dragons were interested in the offering and impressed by Gemma\u2019s confident approach which had previously secured deals."

            "text": "With existing investments in the pet industry, Touker Suleyman was keen to know whether there was potential for more than an annual birthday card before considering an offer. The promise of Valentines, Easter and even 'get well soon' cards from Gemma started to diminish his reservations."

            "text": "With interest from local authorities and a live trial in place, the Kerbo Charger offers a solution with quick to install cabling under the pavement. Michael and Benjamin also showcased their app which allows users to share their charger with neighbours."

            "text": "Looking for a \u00a350k investment for 20% of her business, Maria demonstrated a range of flavours of crisp chocolate hybrids, from ready salted to cheese and onion. The display of onions and chocolate together raised some eyebrows in the Den, but the Dragons were keen to get tucked in."

            "text": "Steven Bartlett wasn\u2019t so sure on the combination, and despite my initial interest, I had to agree. I like my chocolate and crisps separate. But the other Dragons could see how Maria could tap into both a niche audience and the novelty gifting market."

            "text": "After a sample, the Dragons got down into the detail, asking Maria about her sales so far and the retail price of her product. The Dragons felt the price didn\u2019t match up with her packaging and unfortunately didn\u2019t make an offer today."
