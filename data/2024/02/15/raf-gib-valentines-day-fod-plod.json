            "text": "\n\nFOD can be a serious flight safety hazard and generally comprises wind-blown rubbish but can also include tools or shed aircraft components. Because of this hazard, military establishments are directed to sweep the airfield on a regular basis especially after poor weather. This is especially important here in Gibraltar as the runway is unique in that it is used as a crossing by pedestrians, bicycles, and e-scooters daily.\nThe airfield was not due to have any incoming or departing flights allowing the group enough time to collect and remove several bags of rubbish which included a large quantity of plastics and wet wipes.\nRAF Gibraltar\u2019s Corporal Rob Cheshire said: \u201cIf you see any FOD whether it is on the runway or on the beach, please pick it up. These FOD PLODs continue to act as a reminder of the importance that we all must be aware of anything which could be classed as FOD. Let\u2019s all work together to make Gibraltar\u2019s airfield a safer place to travel to and from!\u201d\n\n"
