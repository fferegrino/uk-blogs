Many smaller interventions have also been delivered in the area at catchment scale."

            "text": "The River Aller Floodplain Reconnection scheme is the first large main river restoration scheme of this scale implemented in the UK. The work was designed to take the River Aller back to a natural state from being a single thread channel to a system of multiple, cross-connected channels. This technique reconnects the river to its floodplain, helping to hold back floodwater during high flows and protect downstream communities. Groundwater levels are raised to store more water throughout the year. This helps the river become more resilient during times of prolonged dry weather and drought."

        {
            "text": "The National Trust reversed historical land drainage by filling in the ditch network and spreading deadwood across the system, allowing water to flow freely across the meadow. New flow pathways formed naturally, creating channels connected to the floodplain. This ensures the land remains wet for longer periods of time, boosting biodiversity and increasing water storage capacity."

Several kilometres of ditches were restored using the same techniques deployed at Mudpool Meadow. The farm was also put through arable reversion to reduce the impact of land management on the water environment."
