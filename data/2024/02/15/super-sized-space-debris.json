            "text": "In 2019, the break-up of an upper-stage rocket body caused over 70 pieces of trackable space debris, one of which came dangerously close to the ISS in September 2022 and caused it to\u00a0make a manoeuvre out of the way. Also remember that small debris (under 10cm) is not trackable from Earth, so there are more pieces of debris than what we can see!"
