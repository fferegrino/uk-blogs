In just a matter of minutes you can create a new online form that\u2019s quick to process and incorporates lots of GOV.UK Design System components which are focused on accessibility. This makes it even easier for people to complete government forms. Best of all, there\u2019s no need for any technical knowledge to create a form and it\u2019s completely free to use!"

Another feature on show was the ability to autofill answers, where you have information such as name and address already stored on your device.\u00a0"

Additionally, improvements to user access management processes and the introduction of multi-answer questions will further enhance the platform's functionality, empowering departments to utilise GOV\u2060.\u2060UK Forms in a more self-service manner. The audience also heard how GOV\u2060.\u2060UK Forms will be available to the wider public sector in a later phase, once we have a scalable product for central government as this is our core mandate at GDS."
