At the time, classifying bathing water quality was a pass or fail against the standards. In 2006, based on World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations, a revised Bathing Water Directive introduced the classifications of Excellent, Good, Sufficient or Poor. These classifications were first made in England in 2015 and are what we use today."

            "text": "An annual report is produced each year listing the classifications based on a long-term assessment of water quality over a four-year period with samples being taken at each bathing water site during the bathing water season, between May and September each year."

            "text": "The classifications have many uses including showing trends, allowing comparisons of water quality between bathing waters and also informing decisions on long-term pollution reduction measures.\u00a0 They give an overall indication that helps people make a choice on which bathing water to visit.\u00a0 Most sites are sampled weekly and the cleanest have fortnightly sampling. For more information on sampling, read more on this blog."

To deliver our regulatory duty in relation to short term pollution, we have developed a Pollution Risk Forecasting (PRF) system. The Environment Agency uses weather and tidal data and other sources of information to make pollution risk forecasts to work out when bathing water quality might be temporarily reduced due to factors such as the weather. When the forecasts highlight an increased risk of reduced water quality, pollution risk warnings will be issued and advice against bathing is displayed on Swimfo \u2013 the online tool that allows you to look up details of a designated bathing water by name or location \u2013 and on signs at the beach."
