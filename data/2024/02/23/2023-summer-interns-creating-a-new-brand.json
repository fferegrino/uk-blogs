I was surprised when I found out I had been placed in CDDO as I had studied languages at university and had no background in digital or data. However, I quickly realised people in CDDO are not just techy people but people from all backgrounds. Working in the Communications team has allowed me to gain an insight into different teams in CDDO and wider projects across government.\u00a0"

I have helped quantify and analyse survey results on the new brand. I also helped to review the implications and challenges of introducing a new brand across multiple government departments. The most exciting part of the project I have taken on is organising a photoshoot to create assets for the brand, sourcing participants from different departments and helping to create a photography brief. I cannot wait to see the results!"

I have also greatly benefitted from centrally organised internship events about the Fast Stream selection process which will enable me to apply with confidence. I was even lucky enough to get a tour of Whitehall and a picture outside Number 10.\u00a0"
