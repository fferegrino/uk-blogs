It saddens us to see and hear that financial pressures, including access to subsidies and grants, continue to be a contributing factor and one we\u2019d like to help people overcome."

To make this easier we\u2019ve now linked our extreme weather guidance to the RPA GOV.UK homepage, in the hope this will free up time for more pressing tasks."
