It was this requirement to share data before joining that really made me feel this was something worth our investment.

In my extensive reading about people matters, the requirement for diversity of people and thought in organisations, to enable them to thrive, is overwhelming. Proactive organisations are more likely to achieve stronger results and make better decisions. If an organisation like ours can be as diverse as the citizens we serve, we are more likely to deliver the best products and services.\u00a0\u00a0"
