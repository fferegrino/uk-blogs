They also tend to spend more time with the people they support and are best placed to advocate for the upholding of their human rights. That said, conversations in relation to improving physical activity can be lacking."

Our research found most believed it should be part of their role, in the context of wider efforts to promote physical health and mental wellbeing, as set out in the commitments of the Care Act 2014. They recognise it can help people become more independent, reduce loneliness, improve confidence, and mitigate trauma and substance abuse."

They also said it should be included in social work courses in colleges and universities."

We also conducted interviews, surveys, and World Caf\u00e9s (interactive workshopping, bringing a holistic range of stakeholders together to share ideas) with over 300 social workers and disabled people to understand what they wanted to see included in training and education. A strength-based approach was frequently advocated for."

Thanks to these interventions, disabled young people reported their confidence, self-esteem, and sense of power and control over their lives had improved."
