The view out of our windows will never beat that from the space station, the first six months of our journey in space have had plenty of highlights.\u00a0"

In our first week I was the most northerly person in the British Isles seeing progress building the Saxavord spaceport in Shetland. Meanwhile Annelies was at Edinburgh\u2019s Higgs Innovation Centre celebrating the world-class academics who have given the UK a leading role in the LISA and Euclid missions.\u00a0 \u00a0"

Rejoining Copernicus puts the UK back at the heart of international Earth observation. The National Space Conference in Belfast attracted over 1500 attendees from around the world. We invested \u00a347 million to help build the infrastructure to make products mission-ready. Inside the Agency we\u2019re transforming how we operate so that we focus relentlessly on doing the right things, doing things right and providing the leadership and support the UK space sector needs to thrive.\u00a0"

Before joining the Agency I was only dimly aware of the dangers and risks. I suspect I am not alone. This is a field where the UK can show global thought leadership. And UK companies are innovating and pushing the boundaries of technology, for example as we take the next steps towards active debris removal.\u00a0"
