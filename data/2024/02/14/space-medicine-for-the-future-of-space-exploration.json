As part of the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 21 space agencies now hope to explore Mars as part of their long-term plans. With time and cooperation, this goal will one day become a reality. A journey to Mars could take around seven months, and presents many challenges that need solutions well before take-off. One of the biggest is looking after the health of astronauts during such long journeys, and working out how to bring medicines on missions."

They aim to create a light, room-temperature storage and multi-use system that will allow medicines to be transported in space. Given the storage space limitations, extreme conditions of space and long storage time needed, this is a tricky task."

            "text": "The team are developing a system that can store the proteins that make up medicines for long periods of time, without taking up much space. The system works by sticking the medicine to cellulose and freeze-drying it, then rehydrating it when the medicine is needed, without the need for a full medical laboratory. This system could also have uses on Earth in similar situations where transport and storage options for medicines are limited, such as while mountaineering, on submarines or in areas of conflict."

These components are then \u2018hijacked\u2019 by adding DNA coding for the proteins needed for the desired medicine, and turning those components into the needed proteins."

During these experiments, fluorescent proteins (which simulate proteins used for medicines) and nanobodies (which bind the fluorescent proteins to the cellulose and preserve them) will be \u2018expressed\u2019 in space to recreate the conditions in which an astronaut would need medicine."

            "text": "The aim of the project is to create and then freeze-dry the samples onto cellulose paper with molecules that will preserve them, to prove that the process works and that proteins needed for medicine can be produced this way in a space environment. Once samples return to Earth, the VITA team will look at how well the fluorescent proteins and nanobodies bind to each other. This is an important step, because nanobodies act as a purifier for the proteins needed for medicine, stopping other, unwanted proteins made in the process being given to the astronauts."

Below each well, there are reservoirs containing the liquid solutions which will be used for rehydrating the samples."

The solution will be absorbed by each sample, reviving them from their freeze-dried hibernation and starting the production of fluorescent proteins and nanobodies. This process is similar to how we make instant coffee!"

If the molecules are fluorescent proteins, the LEDs will excite them, causing them to emit light in certain wavelengths. The spectrometer sensors will determine the wavelength of the emitted light determining whether samples in each well are fluorescent proteins or not. This will show whether the experiment is working, and how well it is working."

The binding of the nanobodies and the produced fluorescent proteins will be analysed using the western blotting technique, used to separate and identify proteins. The fluorescence of the fluorescent proteins will also be measured. These will then be compared to the results of the same experiment carried out on Earth, which will show how the experiment differs when carried out in space."
