The team welcomed me with open arms and in my first couple of hours at GDS, I was already helping with the final arrangements for the inaugural Learning Day event. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed internal communications and events - getting completely stuck in.\u00a0"

            "text": "So far, I have learnt how to draft comms plans, send out newsletters, film strategy videos, organise all staff events and much more. I was given responsibility for an audit of the GDS Wiki, a collection of valuable pages where staff go to find important information. I set out plans to check the content, formatting and functionality of each page on the site. This has been a long but rewarding task. Each time I updated a page I felt that I was contributing to something which benefits the wider GDS community.\u00a0"

            "text": "I have even been given opportunities to spread my wings outside of the Communications team. When my line manager discovered I was studying International Relations and German, he immediately thought of introducing me to the International Team at GDS. I assisted the team with a visit from a Ukrainian delegation and am now leading on a visit from a delegation from the Czech Republic. Coordinating with the embassy and ministerial staff to organise the meeting has been exciting and insightful. Through this, I have realised that there are opportunities for international engagement outside of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. I now feel more secure in the knowledge that there are multiple paths towards my career goals.\u00a0"

The people and working environment are overwhelmingly positive and have left me with a dilemma; I am now seriously considering a career in internal comms and events and would love to stay at GDS for longer!\u00a0"
