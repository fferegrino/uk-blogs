The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are innovating change, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs across the UK."

            "text": "I think a modern civil service means the people themselves are comfortable and happy that data is just a thing that they do. It's not a particular thing we have to work hard at, it just happens. I think that is a lot to do with the skills that we have, particularly when you look at kids in school who were learning at coding clubs and who are going to grow up with the fact that you've got all these wonderful kind of new ChatGPTs and tools that they can use as they start to join the civil service, expectations are going to be so much higher."

        {
            "text": "To me, the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) is here to drive the use of digital and data so that everything is there for people to utilise. They can build those skills they need to work with technology, they have access to the data that they need, and all of that just becomes so frictionless and easy that it's just something that we do."

        },
        {
            "text": "There were some great sessions there. I attended a panel session on AI which had the University of Cambridge, the Open Data Institute, the Alan Turing Institute, and Microsoft themselves, all talking about how data fit into this new world of AI? What are the things we should think about? Particularly around data ethics, and like ethical use and responsible use of data.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "There were some aspects that I never really considered in that, and I think that was what I learned most from my One Big Thing training was that actually, there are so many use cases out there and so many pockets of projects and people that are building who are sharing best practice with each other through our communities and who also are doing things that others could make great use of."

            "text": "There's quite a few ways that people can change their behaviour, but the one that I come back to is making it easy and making it frictionless in terms of use of data. Wouldn't it be great if in all of the decision making that we are doing, we're building data into those processes around writing a business case or developing a policy?"

        {
            "text": "Getting feedback on the policy that you've developed, that's where data can drive that behaviour change. It's not in using data itself, it's measuring what it is that you do and actually being able to point to those successes. In order to do that, we need to make data accessible to people."

            "text": "One of the key services we're building this year for the public sector is the data marketplace, which is a central place where if you are developing your digital service, you can discover all of the shared data across the departments. The aim is that you might find something that you were going to ask a citizen to type in themselves or be trying to capture."

If you have amazing analysts or economists or data scientists who are providing you great outputs, you don't necessarily need to know exactly how they're doing those things, but understanding the information that's been presented to you and how to interpret it is a key skill to have."
        },
        {
            "text": "I also think that knowledge of how to interpret the information that you're being presented with is really important, as well as knowing what information you need. Questions you can ask yourself are: \u201cDo I understand enough about the information that is being captured in my organisation and how we might manage those things?\u201d or \u201cIs there data that I need to be able to share with others and is it valuable to other people?\u201d And I think that some of the work we're doing around data ownership and getting organisations to really think about how they are managing data could be really useful."

You might think \u201cHow do I know what to search for in the first place?\u201d,\u00a0 so knowing what questions to ask your data and knowing what it can and can\u2019t answer."

So data marketplaces are there to help you actually find it. Some of you'll remember the Argos catalogue and looking through it thinking, \u201cwhat I ask Santa for Christmas?\u201d and the data ecosystem is a lot like that; what data is there that I can have in my service?"
