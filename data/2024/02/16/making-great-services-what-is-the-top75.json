To improve services, you first need to define what good looks like. Working with teams across government, we\u2019ve created a performance framework defining what makes a \u2018Great\u2019 service. By having a collective understanding CDDO, working closely with departments, can focus our efforts on targeted improvements to have the maximum impact.\u00a0"

By engaging closely with central departments, we collectively identified a list of the highest volume and impact services. Naturally, given the importance of government services in our daily lives, there were a vast range of services numbering far higher than 75. CDDO worked with colleagues and partners to whittle this list down to just 75 services used by citizens all across society, including some well known services like Sign up to Flood Warnings through to Register to Vote.\u00a0"
