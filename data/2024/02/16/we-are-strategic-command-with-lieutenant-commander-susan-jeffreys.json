At the time we were still carrying bunches of keys around hospitals to access our Controlled Drug Cupboards, and when people would lose them, I would think \u201cthere\u2019s got to be something better than this!\u201d."

It was a brilliant event, but the best part was that our team won the hackathon, and I was able to carry on working on the project for 5 months."
