In the Protecting Public Sector Domains team in the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) we work to identify and fix those vulnerabilities before our adversaries find them. We\u2019d also like to do that for other kinds of vulnerabilities, related to email and web services. This isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s a goal we\u2019re working towards."

We found that:"

These are systems that collect and analyse data from different sources like network devices or servers, and external feeds like ours, and use them to spot security issues.
