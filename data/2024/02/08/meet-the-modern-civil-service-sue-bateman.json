The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are innovating change, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs across the UK."

I think capability for data experts and people who are in policy and operational jobs is so important. It is part of a way of working that we all need to be comfortable with."
        },
        {
            "text": "I suppose a big takeaway for me, having seen all of the activities that happened across the civil service, was just how interested and engaged people are in whatever role they're doing in the civil service, and how they have an understanding of the need to improve capability in data skills. I also got to see the kinds of questions that you get from people who are not in those data expert roles. I think we're progressing in terms of our data literacy."

            "text": "I also learned a few things through the week-long celebration of data that we run now on an annual basis, Data Connect. We also had a mini-series of things that we ran in CDDO for our own team members, which was great. I suppose my big takeaway is just the variety of uses that data is being put to with a combination of different kinds of tooling and technology that wouldn't have been there three or four years ago."

            "text": "The first thing that I always say is: data is an enabler. Thinking about data capability, about how we design systems and services that have data at the heart \u2014 those are the means for us to be able to deliver great services to the public and to us as civil servants, and develop data best practice policies in a world that is increasingly complex."
        },
        {
            "text": "We've got some way to go where data is seen as a natural part of designing public services and policies. We need to get to a position where everybody, regardless of their role, sees the use of data as another thing in their toolkit that is going to help them to do their job better. From a CDDO and from a data team perspective, we're doing lots of things to enable that. Whether that be from creating the new legislation that enables data sharing through to helping organisations think about how they make their data more discoverable and usable through to sharing data with others, underpinning all of that capability."

            "text": "There are lots of programs and initiatives where you see a recognition that working across those departmental boundaries is really important to thinking about some of those big policy questions in a holistic way. And so if you think of that as being the way that we are looking at a modern civil service, then data and digital becomes absolutely integral and foundational to helping that."

So one great example, but also one where some of the learnings and maybe some of the guidance and blueprints can be replicated elsewhere, is the BOLD (Better Outcomes through Linked Data) Programme. It's a program being led by the Ministry of Justice in partnership with a number of other organisations which looks at how you start to join up information across the system to help with issues around offending and, ultimately, aims to reduce reoffending.\u00a0"

There are some powers that were created a few years ago now with the aim of helping people who were struggling financially and potentially being classed as in fuel poverty. Now the only way that people could previously get assistance for fuel and other kinds of energy support from the government would be to go to the government to get that support."

            "text": "Through the Digital Economy Act, and then through the partners in government and the energy suppliers, there's now an automated regime where the government is now able to offer support to those people directly through targeted support. It\u2019s a great example of different government agencies working together and then working with the energy providers who provide the ultimate service."

            "text": "So the marketplace for me is that front door where users are going to be able to come through to find out what data there is, how useful it's going to be, then find out how to use it. We need to think about data within government, but also look at building a separate repository around open data, where we make that openly available for reuse."
