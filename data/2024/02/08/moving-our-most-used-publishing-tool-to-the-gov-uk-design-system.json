            "text": "Over the last year we\u2019ve been making improvements to Whitehall, including simplifying the way images are added. Now we\u2019ve completed a bigger overhaul of the CMS - moving its user interface, the part of the system publishers see and interact with, to the GOV.UK Design System. We did this to make the CMS more accessible, and make it quicker and easier to publish content. This has simplified the publishing process for civil servants and, in turn, means the millions of people that use GOV.UK every single day get vital information more quickly."

The colours, font sizes, and components it contains were built to be accessible for all users, including those who require assistive technologies to navigate online services. Meanwhile updating the user interface makes the codebase - the text written in the programming language that Whitehall was built with - less complex. This will lead to a better experience for developers when they make future improvements to Whitehall."

With this in mind, the approach we took was to convert Whitehall like-for-like to the design system. The image below shows how document search has been changed in this way."

So, as we were improving Whitehall, we decided to release the updates in manageable packages as opposed to waiting until it was all complete. Before a release, the team communicated the changes to publishers via Basecamp."

            "text": "In addition, the guidance to using the application is edited to reflect the latest design and/or functionality updates. Every time a release happens, our users let us know what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t via Basecamp, Zendesk as well as the Publisher Survey. If anything needs to be revisited the team quickly responds and makes any necessary improvements."
