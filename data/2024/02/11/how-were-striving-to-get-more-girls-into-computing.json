Computer science can be a great accelerator of social mobility, and I want to equip all young people at our academy with a skillset that will enable them to take up the opportunities the subject offers."

We have trialed different initiatives over the past couple of years to try and tackle this, with varying degrees of success. The number of girls engaging with the subject has increased but to nowhere near the extent that we would like to see."

It requires a whole school approach with buy-in from senior leadership, changes to the approach to teaching, and a focus on increasing the visibility of women who study and work in computing."
