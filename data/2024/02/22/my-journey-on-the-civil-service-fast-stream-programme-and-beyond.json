Being trusted and given the responsibility to make a difference in such a wide variety of roles has made a huge difference too.

Perhaps best were the many supportive and inspiring conversations we had as a cohort and still do, catching up for breakfast recently, for example."

The scheme liberates you to develop your own leadership approach, rather than being prescriptive about what that should be. Getting on to the scheme was difficult though \u2013 it took me a couple of attempts, but it was absolutely worth it."

Even if you are not successful at the first attempt, ask your HR team for support, I was fortunate to be offered some interview coaching which really changed the way I saw what I hoped I could offer and laid the foundation for my time on the scheme."
