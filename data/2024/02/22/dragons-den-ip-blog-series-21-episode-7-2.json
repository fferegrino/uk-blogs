More than just a sugary treat though, his flavoured gummy sweets, Tasty Mates, have an important message attached: check in on a friend and see how they\u2019re doing during these hard times and perhaps even indulge in the snack together."

            "text": "In the case of Tasty Mates, one by one the Dragons declared themselves out, all because they didn\u2019t believe in the strength of the brand, until there was only one Dragon left. Although Peter Jones had similar reservations he said he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the product and offered Joe the full \u00a360,000 investment he was hoping for, but for the much heftier stake of 20% of the business. Joe jumped at the chance. I\u2019m sure they themselves will become \u2018tasty mates\u2019 as well as having a lucrative business relationship."

            "text": "As a massive lover of a beach holiday, just seeing Dave Weller\u2019s brightly coloured beachwear products even before the man himself had entered the Den, my mind was transported to sunnier climes. If the prospect of a beach product wasn\u2019t enough, imagine my excitement when Dave immediately mentioned the patented functionality of the sealable waterproof pocket within the swimwear!"

        {
            "text": "As Dave explained more about the investment he was after for his company, Randy Cow, it turned out that the patent itself was owned by another company. This use of another company\u2019s IP can be a really useful strategy, especially where saving time is important. A business may get its products or services to market more quickly by acquiring a \u00a0licence (link) to use existing IP, instead of re-inventing the wheel."

            "text": "While licensing IP from others can be a very useful business strategy it\u2019s always worth thinking about how best to protect the IP assets already in the business. Touker\u2019s advice got me thinking about the other types of IP rights Dave could look to protect: designs."
        },
        {
            "text": "It was another investment for Peter, who saw the potential in Randy Cow. He persuaded Touker to join him, bringing his manufacturing and fashion credentials to the business. The Dragons were happy to share the investment of \u00a380,000 for 40% of the business."
