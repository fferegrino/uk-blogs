However, research DSIT commissioned with the Royal Society, and interviews we conducted throughout 2023, suggests organisations often struggle to articulate and the benefits (and costs) associated with using PETs. This can make it difficult to develop business cases for the adoption of PETs.\u00a0"

In federated learning, a central server sends a copy of a partially trained model to each participant and collects\u202fmodel updates instead of data. Each participant constructs its model update by training the model locally on its own data - which it never shares. The resulting model updates can be aggregated and assembled to construct an improved global model.\u00a0"

Our baseline for comparison is a more traditional method of training an equivalent model on the same data collated into a central location. In this baseline we assume training data has been collected, is distributed across different entities, and contains personal or otherwise sensitive information. This baseline scenario therefore has costs associated with gathering this data into a central location. Baseline and federated scenarios are shown in Figure 1.\u00a0"

However, PPFL removes the need to transfer a copy of all the training data to a central database. This can lead to lower infrastructure and network overheads, compared to the baseline, especially for large training datasets.\u00a0"

Depending on the privacy requirements of parties involved, it may be necessary to implement PPFL using secure CPU or GPU enclaves to provide input privacy. This will require purchasing hardware with enclave support or utilising a managed cloud service like Azure Confidential Computing or AWS Nitro Enclaves. Alternatively, homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation could be used to provide input privacy. Whilst these do not require access to bespoke hardware, they do introduce compute and network overheads. The scale of these overheads is highly dependent on the specific scheme used, e.g. compute overheads for homomorphic encryption-based approaches may be especially significant.\u00a0"

The baseline case requires the maintenance of a (potentially large) central database, and the implementation of appropriate data governance and security mechanisms to protect and secure any sensitive data. For PPFL, these costs and risks are devolved. For example, in federated learning scenarios where multiple organisations are collaborating, different data owners will bear these costs.\u00a0\u00a0"

This anonymisation of outputs limits data protection risks caused by inappropriate or insecure disclosure or publication of personal data. Processing data locally also aligns with the legal requirement of data minimisation and data protection-by-design and default. This helps organisations to comply with the UK GDPR, can reduce the risk of data breaches and associated costs, and simplify contractual requirements.\u00a0"

Through this, PPFL could firstly help organisations make their own data assets available to other organisations, and secondly, allow organisations to access other data assets which have become available in the same way. Making data that would not have previously been accessible due to the \u2018copy problem\u2019 (where data owners may be reluctant to share data due to the reduction in the data\u2019s value that could follow) accessible, could create opportunities to benefit from the value of data e.g. by monetising access to it.

In contrast to centralised approaches, it is a relatively novel architectural approach that requires upfront investment amidst uncertainty about wider innovation in data privacy and future compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. However, as above, potential benefits of embedding federated learning to protect data by design are broad, and in reducing the need to move large amounts of data to integrate updates into centralised models, PPFL may be a more robust, future-proof approach and minimise the potential legal and compliance risks that organisations expose themselves to. Users and regulators may look favourably on organisations that do privacy well, and reputational benefits may result from the use of federated learning, which can offer substantial improvements in data security and privacy.\u00a0"

PPFL provides opportunities for organisations to increase innovation and collaboration with data in ways that are not currently realised. We believe that this is in part due to a lack of understanding about costs and benefits of PPFL, and hope that enabling understanding of these costs and benefits will encourage further adoption of PETs.\u00a0"
