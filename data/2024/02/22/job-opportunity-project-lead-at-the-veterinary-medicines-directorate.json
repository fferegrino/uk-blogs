A key focus of the NBN is facilitating the sharing of privately-held data with government, which we are piloting for data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals."

            "text": "AMR is a truly One Health issue, with resistant organisms able to transfer between animals and people, and resistance genes being transmissible between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In the UK, we have well-established programmes of AMR surveillance in healthy food-producing animals at slaughter. However, the majority of testing for AMR in veterinary diagnostic submissions is performed by private veterinary laboratories and does not feed into governmental surveillance. This means our understanding of AMR in animals is limited, which affects our wider ability to assess AMR risks, and detect and respond to emerging threats."

You will liaise with experts at the VMD and APHA and external partners within the NBN to ensure effective join-up across animal health sectors. You will also interface with the AMR team at APHA, and the Surveillance Intelligence Unit (SIU), to enable collation, verification, and analysis of external AMR data. You will be supported by a project manager."
