Destination Nuclear is a campaign that\u2019s bringing together government and private companies to help attract and recruit more people to fill skills gaps."

In fact, it\u2019s estimated that as many as 40,000 new roles will be available in the sector by 2030."

The NDA group alone invests more than \u00a345 million each year in apprentice, graduate and PhD programmes. More than 1,000 people are following early career programmes and this year will see the intake of NDA group graduates double from 2023, with up to 120 new recruits joining us in September."

Safety cases exist for all of our projects and facilities to ensure we think though the right way of doing things and maintain high standards of nuclear safety and radioactive waste management. At first, I was anxious about my lack of experience, but the many years I\u2019d spent working in patient care and as a child protection secretary have proved to be advantageous."

We have a unique and proud history, from the development of the UK nuclear industry to now employing more than 11,000 people on a 100-year project to transform the site for all generations that follow. We\u2019re setting standards in high-hazard reduction and I\u2019m hugely proud to be part of that."

Today I have more responsibility and help train the next generation of nuclear industry recruits."

There are more than 900 different types of role across the NDA group and we have opportunities from nuclear scientists to train drivers and environmental protectors to IT specialists. Some of the most in demand skills are in business areas such as procurement as well as project and programme management."
