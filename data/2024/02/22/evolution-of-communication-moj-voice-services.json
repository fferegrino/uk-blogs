            "text": "Alexander Graham Bell's 1876 telephone call marked a milestone in communication, pioneering the ability to converse over long distances using electricity. Fast forward 122 years to 1998 and my first IT job, and a desk phone with a fixed extension number was still my main means of communication. Since then, our methods of communication at work and at home have exploded. Today we have a suite of options available to choose from and the term \u2018Unified Communications\u2019 has been coined to describe the many communications channels used by businesses. Voice, conferencing, mobile phone, video, instant messaging, directory, chat, email, voicemail, fax (yes it still exists). Take your pick."

            "text": "Never mind all those options, this blog is supposed to be about Voice Services at the Ministry of Justice. However, defining where one communication channel ends and another starts can be difficult in today\u2019s landscape. MoJ's Voice Services enable communication between individuals in different locations, utilising telephone numbers for connection to public networks. They offer feature-rich functionalities like auto-attendant and call queues. Comparing Microsoft Teams and Teams Phone illustrates the blurred boundaries; while Teams allows calls within organisations, Teams Phone provides global connectivity via telephone numbers. Telephony remains crucial for MoJ's public facing services and contributes to Justice Digital's strategic aim of delivering swift access to justice.\u00a0"

That includes Service Owners, Product Managers, Operations Managers, Infrastructure Engineers, and Delivery Managers, enabling us to take control of all aspects of the products that make up the service.
