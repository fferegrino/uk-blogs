It\u2019s been around a 15-month process in total, with the first year being the main \u2018on-the-job\u2019 learning and evidence-gathering, and then around three months for the final assessment period."

Cloud technology is very new to me, and the opportunity to work alongside experienced engineers, working on both familiar and new tasks, has been hugely beneficial, and the extra opportunities provided in the form of certifications and training has been brilliant too."

The opportunity to gain these certifications, as well as achieving the entry point into Cloud Technology, was a brilliant chance to take."

The day then continues with managing the service desk for any requests that may need priority assisting, and I work on any project-related tasks that have come in."

            "text": "These tasks or issues are then further discussed in our project stand-up, and any urgent requests or updates are discussed here too. Time is spent with my mentors on EPR, who are other engineers within the Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE), working on tasks or shadowing for further experience. As well as this work, we may also have project releases scheduled in for the day, where at set times we work alongside the wider project team to complete a new feature release/update, ensuring all goes well."

This has included creating resources and knowledge share sessions for my colleagues regarding the apprenticeship requirements and End Point Assessment (EPA), to try and help us all understand the requirements better so we can succeed the best way we can. I have liaised with the apprenticeship provider, and my managers, to try and organise the EPA method, so that we all have a good idea of how we are going to structure the assessment against the provided criteria."

The benefits of automation are endless, as the ideal goal is that one day we will be able to push one single button and deploy whole environments in moments, speeding up project timelines dramatically."

            "text": "Completing the certifications against the proposed deadlines, especially the AZ-104 which was the most difficult certification out of all of them, while balancing the rest of my responsibilities, was tricky. The AZ-104 is a certification that requires extensive knowledge of Azure technologies with at least 6 months experience on the job, so learning to balance my responsibilities to project and service desk stakeholders through my on-the-job work, my commitment to the apprenticeship and portfolio work, and my certification training required good organisation and communication with stakeholders."

I believe it\u2019s quite common when in a new role, especially one where you are viewed as the \u2018trainee apprentices\u2019 that you can feel there is a large expectation on you to perform well and take on as much as you can to show your ability."
