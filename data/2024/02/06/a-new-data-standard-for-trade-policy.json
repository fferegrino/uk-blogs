For example, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) set the rules on biosecurity, covering the checks required to import animal and plant products. Similarly, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport set the rules on movement of antique and culturally significant goods."

            "text": "The ultimate source for all trade policy is legislation laid by these departments and ratified by Parliament. Once laid, all UK trade policy is encoded as structured data and entered into a ledger database. The Department of Business and Trade and HMRC are responsible for keeping the ledger timely and accurate. It records all UK trade rules all the way back to 1970 and has over 2.5 million records."

However, there is no canonical documentation on how the data works or what it means. If government has to evolve the language, there's nowhere for it to collaborate with the wider international trade community. Historically, government has simply made the changes it needs to and it's been up to downstream consumers to handle the change in meaning, often with little notice."

By doing so, we'll evolve the language for communicating trade policy together with the whole international trade community and make contributing and consuming trade policy data easier and more reliable. Better data means government and the private sector can deliver higher quality services."

Government provides some of this information, whereas some is provided by third party providers like freight companies or data resellers."

The less human reinterpretation or rekeying of policy, the less opportunity there is to introduce accuracy errors."
