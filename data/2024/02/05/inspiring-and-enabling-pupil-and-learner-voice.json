The project developed a framework for engaging children and young people in discussion about mental health, and having their voices heard. As a result, we have seen an increase in pupils asking for help with their mental health. Pupils have also been presenting with growing confidence and self-worth, a clearer sense of purpose, trust, and sense of belonging."

We involved them in the development off our wellbeing page, suggestions for the wellbeing display board and developing a Mental Health Anti Stigma campaign, in collaboration with Investing in Children. The training programme is now being delivered in schools across the North East."

After completing the training, I feel we have a stable foundation on which to build a solid and effective platform for our pupil\u2019s voices."

To give our pupils a genuine voice and ensure they feel listened to and understood, we transitioned from traditional paper surveys to an online format, incorporating questions from the Anna Freud Centre's, Me and my feelings questionnaire. This allowed us to engage with our pupils on their mental health needs in a more meaningful way."

            "text": "Another pivotal shift was introducing \"You said, we did\" assemblies to demonstrate to our students that their voices are heard and their concerns matter. For example, pupils expressed concern about rushed lunchtimes, so we've created a dedicated table for those who need more time, with plans to extend the option to eat outside in the summer and we reported this change back to them in assembly. By addressing hygiene issues in the toilets, we're empowering children with gentle reminders and peer support to take better care of shared spaces."

A twice-yearly pupil voice survey about all curriculum subjects is also completed in tutor time. The survey helps us understand how pupils feel about their learning in all subjects and what works for them. We feedback to pupils using a \u201cyou said this, and we are doing that\u201d approach, which is very important to us."
