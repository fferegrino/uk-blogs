The first focuses on identifying and defining the data gaps that exist, paving the way for future research and policy development. The second study dives deeper into the analysis of carbon accumulation, gathered using real-world sampling, seeking to expand our evidence and establish a more robust understanding of how restored salt marshes contribute to our carbon capture efforts. This involved collecting and analysing sediment cores from the restored saltmarshes (or reanalysing cores and data kindly provided by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Both these projects look to utilise the climate mitigation benefits of saltmarshes to help us achieve Net Zero,\u201d he says. \u00a0"
