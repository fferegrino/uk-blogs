It\u2019s worth reflecting that every Government elected since WW2 has maintained the nuclear elements of our energy and defence policies and supported the development of nuclear medicine, as well as the use of radioactive materials in a wide range of industries."

But that history, and our continued use of radioactive materials, means we have a growing legacy of waste which we now must make permanently safe. That\u2019s where my role comes in \u2013 to close the loop and make sure people are protected now and long into the future."

        {
            "text": "But first, we need to understand what we are dealing with. For example, what type of radioactivity is the waste generating and how intense is that radiation? We gain this knowledge from understanding the elements (or \u2018radionuclides\u2019) that are present in the waste and their proportion. From this information we can determine how long the waste will stay harmfully radioactive, (remember- radioactivity gradually decays over time) but we also need to understand the other physical and chemical properties of each waste form \u2013 e.g. liquid/sludge or solid \u2013 and what treatment processes have been used. The non-radioactive (but still hazardous) properties of the waste need to be considered too. Once we understand (or \u2018characterise\u2019) the waste fully, we can treat it, appropriately, package it and transport it to be recycled, reused or disposed."

There are a range of solutions available including our Low Level Waste Repository site and our future Geological Disposal Facility (GDF)."

            "text": "The Repository site has been the national disposal facility since 1959, ensuring that the UK\u2019s low level waste is safely and permanently disposed of in a way that protects people and the environment. In other words, we know what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve been doing it for a very long time."

        {
            "text": "That includes planning for the future. We\u2019re always looking at treatment or other alternatives to disposal for waste that doesn\u2019t need the protection of an engineered facility like ours. We\u2019ve also started work on installation of the final closure engineering (capping) of historical disposal areas, and we\u2019re planning the construction of future vaults to accommodate the waste that will arise over the next century."

        {
            "text": "Our future GDF deals with higher activity waste, and we are currently engaging with potential host communities to establish where it should be built. A key consideration for the GDF\u2019s design is that it must have the capacity to deal with the \u2018inventory for disposal\u2019 that has been identified. Although the higher activity waste category is much smaller in volume than the waste we deal with at the Repository, it requires the additional protection provided by deep disposal in a suitable geology, and a portion of the waste is heat generating so we need to take that into account."

That way, we can create a chain of continuous improvement on our journey to dispose of our radioactive waste in the safest way possible."

Whilst it is already safe, putting an engineered \u2018cap\u2019 over the top of it is an essential component of our Environmental Safety Case, it enables us to demonstrate that we meet all the requirements placed on us by our regulators, and that the site will be safe long after we\u2019re gone. The cap will be made of multiple layers of strong impermeable materials to form the final barrier to protect the waste, while its radioactive content gradually reduces through the process of radioactive decay. The land above the cap will look like a natural feature in the landscape."

            "text": "The concept of using multiple layers or barriers also forms key part of the science behind geological disposal. A GDF is made up of a series of highly engineered vaults and tunnels between 200 and 1,000 metres below ground in a suitable rock formation. Combined with engineered barriers, this multi-barrier approach will protect the environment by keeping the waste isolated from the surface while the radioactivity naturally reduces to safe levels."

The findings from our site evaluation work will inform our decisions, for approval by UK Government, about the site or sites to be taken forward into the phase known as \u2018site characterisation\u2019. This involves understanding the properties of the geology with detailed investigations such as the drilling of deep boreholes. We also have to consider logistics and transport, and potential local and environmental impacts. This isn\u2019t something we can rush. \u00a0Our next major milestone for the programme is to start deep sub-surface borehole investigations. You can learn more about GDFs here."

This is known as passive safety and removes the need for human intervention while the radioactivity decays, keeping future generations safe."
