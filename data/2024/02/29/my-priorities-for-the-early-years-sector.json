            "text": "But Ofsted is about much more than schools. And I\u2019m determined to give equal focus to each sector that Ofsted regulates and inspects. We owe it to parents and families to make sure their children receive the best education and care at every stage. And that of course includes the vital early years sector."

And I will be meeting with more organisations, providers, and individuals in the coming months. The EYA and NDNA have also kindly agreed to share this blog with their members to make sure the whole sector knows that Ofsted recognises the essential job you all do."

            "text": "Children only get one childhood, and getting those precious early years right is absolutely crucial. Without the building blocks laid in the first few years of a child\u2019s life, they may fall behind in language and communications, struggle in school, need additional help later in life, and find it difficult to form meaningful relationships. Ultimately, they may not be able to reach their full potential."

            "text": "I want to make sure nobody thinks the early years is just \u201cwhat happens before education.\u201d It is, of course, the first stage of a child\u2019s education, and most importantly the one on which all of their future education and life is built."

            "text": "The nurseries and childminders, nannies and teachers, staff and carers, and everyone else helping the youngest children to learn, thrive, and grow deserve as much recognition as all the other groups that Ofsted works with."

            "text": "We are the inspectorate for schools, while the Department for Education is the regulator. But for the early years sector, we have both roles. So, we register new provision, respond to concerns when they arise, and confirm when the essential improvements have been made. And so, we continued our regulatory work in the interest of keeping children safe and enabling new providers to open."
