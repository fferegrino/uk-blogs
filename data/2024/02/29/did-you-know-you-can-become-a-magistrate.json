We hear\ncases on things like minor assaults, motoring offences, theft and stalking. We pass the most serious\ncrimes, such as murder, rape and robbery, to the Crown Court.\nAfter hearing all the evidence, we consider all the facts and decide if the person has committed an offence."

We always bear in mind if any rehabilitation measures (e.g unpaid work) could help to reduce re-offending behaviour. We are supported by a legal adviser who ensures our proposed sentence is aligned with the law."

It\nhas given me a real insight into the wider criminal justice system and the way all partners and agencies work together to deliver access to justice. For example, through Judicial College training, I\u2019ve learned a lot about issues such as mental health and domestic abuse and this reminded me the importance of the LAA making it easier for vulnerable people to get legal support."
