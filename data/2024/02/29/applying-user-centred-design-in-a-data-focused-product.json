We had to create mock scenarios and mock data so that, during research, users could navigate and interact with a realistic journey. While mock data is a useful tool, it only gives a snapshot of what the final data may look like. The final live data is likely to have its own unique situations that mock data doesn\u2019t account for, as well as variations across data sets, and so this must be considered during research."
