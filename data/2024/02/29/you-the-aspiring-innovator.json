On the other hand, many see their role as maintaining the status quo, as system stewards, which is a legitimate role and major part of what government does \u2013 keeping the lights on, so to speak, meeting targets, running business as usual. Self- awareness is vital here, but chances are that if you are reading this article then you have the ambition to be a Public Entrepreneur!"

            "text": "In the iLab we have learned that passion is a major component of just keeping good ideas alive, and that protecting innovation from the inclination of the system with a low appetite for change to stifle change requires a lot of determination. In From Design Thinking to System Change, Rowan Conway puts language to this phenomenon, referring to it as the \u201cimmune response\u201d of the system to innovation. Our bodies are programmed to kill off rogue cells, viruses and diseases, so too are large bureaucracies. Legitimately, these are systems geared specifically to ensure compliance and to protect the interests of Accounting Officers, to prevent, detect and destroy what is illegal or fraudulent or at variance from agreed procedures. But the prevailing culture, coupled with these systems, will also act to prevent innovation."

Do you realise that achieving a system level or step change \u2013 one that will become deeply embedded and permeate the whole system - is a long game? There really are no quick fixes. Complex problems will take time to work through \u2013 some of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed in our public services have existed for years, and despite the best intentions of many who have preceded us, and the investment of public money, these remain entrenched, even intractable and apparently unsolvable."

We waste a lot of time and resources by not looking for an already existing solution that can be easily adapted to meet local need. And we have all heard the common reasons for not doing so: our system is different, our population has slightly different characteristics etc. But successful Public Entrepreneurs will just as readily, and successfully, go with an existing, proven solution, rather than waste time and resource on building new. It is a most credit-worthy thing to do, and we need more of it! In this regard are you prepared to invest the time in researching what is \u2018out there\u2019, embarking on a literature review, visits to other jurisdictions, forming alliances, to find the already existing and proven solution to your problem?"

Are you prepared to experiment, test, iterate, modify and generally take calculated risks to ensure the innovation is shaped and altered in the light of learning from experimentation? And are you really going to cut loose things that aren\u2019t working, and hold out for the next iteration? And are you prepared to terminate decrepit, creaking systems and process that are in the way of your innovation."
