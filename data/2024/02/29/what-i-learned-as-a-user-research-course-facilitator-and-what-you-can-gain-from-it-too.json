            "text": "Last year in July, I joined the cross-government user research training community to facilitate an \u2018Introduction to User Research in Government\u2019 online course. The course aims to educate researchers and practitioners from non-user research backgrounds to apply good research practice in a government context. It also offers avenues to network and connect with other professionals."

            "text": "The training is offered by a community of researchers who are passionate about improving access to education and upskilling for user-centred design professionals. Over the years, it has evolved to accommodate the changing needs of user groups as well as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, it\u2019s delivered every few months remotely and is available to all professionals across government. Here are some things I have gained from being a facilitator, and some ideas about what you could learn from it too."

Before joining as a facilitator, I hardly knew anyone in the cross-government community and my understanding on its structure was quite hazy. Through running the course, I had the chance to speak to professionals from across the organisation who helped me piece the puzzle together and better understand how the government community is built. The trainees also offered insightful comments on their day-to-day and unique user research considerations, like informed consent or safeguarding."

The structure of the course allows plenty of time for open and interactive discussions where trainees have a chance to share their experiences employing different research methods or overcoming challenges. As a result, at the end of the course, we gathered a comprehensive list of tips and resources as supplementary learning for everyone."
