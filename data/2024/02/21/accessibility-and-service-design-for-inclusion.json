Current estimates in England and Wales show that approximately sixteen million people (around 24%) are known to be affected by a disability. However, this figure is reliant on the rates of disclosure, and so there is likely to be more people than this."

As part of this work, I have also considered the impact of asking people to disclose their disability, and how this question might make them feel. While this question is important for ensuring people are given the support they need, it can be triggering for some. This means that we need to design in a way that is trauma informed and respectful.\u00a0 Asking the same question multiple times is unnecessary and can also mean service users disengage early in the process.\u00a0"

            "text": "I have learnt that designing for those that need a service can often make the process universally accessible to all. Assistive Technology (AT) is a good example of this. AT is any device or software program that is used to maintain or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities, such as a person with sight loss using text to speech technology to navigate a website. I have used AT devices for about five years to help with everyday tasks. If we understand how AT users use our service, we can design services in a more accessible way.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is not without its challenges, but by including service beneficiaries in the design process (otherwise known as co-design), we can better understand journeys, pathways and how, why, and when users interact with our services.\u00a0"

We also use Equality Impact Assessments to help us understand both our positive impact, and any unintended consequences that our designs could have."

            "text": "One future trend in design is hyper personalisation, which involves using real time data to enable customisation for taste and preference.\u00a0 An example of this might be developing a service that allows users to interact face-to-face, by video call, by audio call or by text service whilst giving them the ability to select their preferred language. This is the very mission reflected in the current government digital strategy, and it is starting to have an impact. At Basildon Council, we have our own strategy for digital inclusion, which is another way that we can show our commitment to accessibility and inclusion."
