I was always interested in drones, innovation, and robotics. Innovation was a thread throughout my grad scheme. I did placements inside and outside of the MoD. When roles came up at the jHub, I transitioned into Strategic Command, did some innovation work, and became more of a project manager than a technical engineer."

One of the first projects I was assigned to was Project TALOS, which was one of the jHub\u2019s biggest and longest projects. It involved integrated force protection, combining different types of sensors and effectors into one Command and Control system."

Having different perspectives during internal discussions is valuable because there's a variety of opinions. We have people with backgrounds in English, history, geology, and more. You don't necessarily need to be highly technical to do well here."
