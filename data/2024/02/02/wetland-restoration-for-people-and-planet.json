The adoption took place in the Iranian city of Ramsar, on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It provides a framework for the conservation and protection of wetland sites across the globe, through local and national action and international cooperation."

It\u2019s well-known that spending time outdoors brings a myriad of benefits to both physical and mental health, with 91% of adults who visited a green and natural space in the previous 14 days agreeing that spending time outdoors was good for their mental health. (People & Nature Survey data 2022-23). Blue environments, including ponds, lakes, rivers, and the sea, can provide people with space for recreation as well as respite from busy lifestyles, helping us to find a sense of peace and connect with nature."

            "text": "Our wetlands are vital for our planet, but they are disappearing at an alarming rate. Over the past 500 years, England has lost approximately 90% of its wetlands. Work is being done through many organisations and partnerships to restore, enhance, increase and connect the habitats that have been lost, helping to ensure that nature recovers \u2013 and thrives into the future."

This has involved engaging local communities with individual volunteering opportunities, through corporate volunteering and sponsorship, and through our pro-active \u2018friends of\u2019 groups. The Lower Derwent Valley NNR covers over 600ha of the 1000ha of floodplain meadows adjacent to Yorkshire\u2019s River Derwent. It supports nationally and internationally important breeding, passage and wintering bird populations as well as a significant wet grassland communities. An estimated 40,000 visitors enjoy and benefit from the reserve every year."

The opportunities also aim to raise awareness of our Green Social Prescribing work being delivered within the area by our regional teams and pilot projects. These immersive days have included staff from the Humber, Tees, Wear and Esk Valley NHS trusts and have involved research teams, clinical and care staff and their executives."

Other tasks include willow coppicing, footpath repair, boardwalk recreation, hedge planting or reedbed creation. Being involved in this way allows people to experience first-hand the wellbeing benefits of working to recover nature. All our participants have reported an improvement in mood and wellbeing, as well as a reduction in stress as a result of the volunteering work undertaken."

It provides an important agricultural resource and locks away carbon in the soils. While supporting biodiversity and enhancing climate resilience, the site also provides a quiet retreat for those wishing to appreciate the natural world and find a sense of peace, as well as space for recreational activities."

The Nature Recovery Network (NRN) is a major commitment in the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP23). It is a growing national network of wildlife-rich places, that will expand, improve and connect these places across our cities, towns, countryside and coast. By bringing together partners, legislation and funding, we can restore and enhance the natural environment."

The LIFE Moor Space project is focused on restoring the degraded lowland raised bog of Goole and Crowle Moors. Belonging to the Humberhead Peatlands NNR, the moors form part of the largest lowland raised bog complex in England."

            "text": "At the site, our local teams are installing dams and adjustable weirs to help control water, as well as clearing drains. Keeping water levels raised to ground level all-year round will encourage sphagnum moss and other desired bog plants to grow in areas where we currently have standing water and bare peat, supporting carbon storage. This is a true collaborative exercise involving multiple landowners."

            "text": "Our teams are working in partnership with Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, landowners, farmers, internal drainage boards and local authorities to ensure restoration is successful and surrounding farmland is protected. Each action takes us one step closer to our nature recovery ambitions. Together, we are also investigating the viability of joining schemes like the Peatland Code, and identifying ways that farmers on the edge of the moors can manage their land to further enhance recovery."

            "text": "Using traditional tools alongside new ones such as drones, we are able to view the moors as never before, enabling us to target our interventions more effectively. We are also bringing the public along with us. Many of these new and novel tools have been used to \u2018tell our story\u2019, and that of the moor\u2019s recovery, raising public understanding of the benefits of nature recovery and support for work in hand."

            "text": "Projects such as those at our Lower Derwent Valley and Humberhead Peatlands NNRs, show the importance of nature recovery in a place and restoring nature for the benefit of all. We are stronger together. Through partnerships we can work towards achieving the goals set out in the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan, to grow our national Nature Recovery Network. By increasing, improving and connecting green and blue wildlife-rich places close to where people live, and helping the next generation become champions for nature, we will see our wetlands and the species that dwell therein recover and thrive, for a much brighter, resilient, more nature-connected future."
