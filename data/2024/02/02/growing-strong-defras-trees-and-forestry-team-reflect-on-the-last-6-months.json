We have created new jobs in Forestry and related sectors over the last 4 years, with more to come in the future (see our forestry apprenticeship programme)- the roots of this programme will run deep."

We look forward to sharing the results with you in our next blog!"

Scientific research will leave a lasting legacy of knowledge that will have far-reaching benefits. Newly funded projects are helping us better understand how trees interact with soils, each other, and the wider environment. There is so much that we still need to learn, and partnerships with Forest Research, Royal Botanic Kew Gardens, University of Gloucester and University of Reading\u00a0 and the advice of our expert Trees and Woodland Science Advisory Group are helping us understand more all the time."

Collaborating with other government departments, the construction and insurance sectors, wood processors, academic institutions and many more, we\u2019ve co-created a pathway that will see us address knowledge gaps and take action to increase the safe use of timber in construction, locking up carbon and providing many other benefits."
