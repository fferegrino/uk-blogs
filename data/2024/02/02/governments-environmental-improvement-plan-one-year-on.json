This project promotes a simple idea: that riparian shade keeps rivers, the salmon and trout and other life within them, cool. So, we\u2019ve collaborated with key partners such as the Woodland Trust and Rivers Trusts to plant trees and install riparian fencing along appropriate sites."

Shade from trees can reduce temperatures in small rivers on average by 2\u20134\u00baC (compared to unshaded streams). In the Ribble catchment we\u2019ve seen some great results of shaded sites being over 6\u00b0C cooler on hot days."

Peatlands are an iconic feature of England\u2019s landscape - often referred to as \u201cour national rainforest\u201d. They contain over half of the country\u2019s terrestrial carbon stores and provide a haven for wildlife, as well as supporting better water quality and natural flood management.\nThey cover just 3% of the world\u2019s surface yet holds nearly 30% of soil carbon. Around 70% of drinking water in the UK comes from peat dominated landscapes, yet ~80% of peatlands are degraded or modified.\nWe have a unique role with peat management: from reducing climate change impacts and flood risks to improving biodiversity and maintaining sustainable agriculture through nature-based solutions.\nLearn more about the project."

It may require us to think differently, collaborate and invest in change but together these actions will help us to transition to a climate resilient nation."
