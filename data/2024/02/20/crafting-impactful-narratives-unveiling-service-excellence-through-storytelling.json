            "text": "Assessments give an independent evaluation of your work and your service, and so there\u2019s a limited amount of time to get your story across. I see a number of assessments falter because teams aren\u2019t able to tell their story succinctly. Much like crafting a compelling narrative in literature, effective storytelling in service assessments involves several key elements and here are my top tips for service teams."

            "text": "In any great story, the audience needs to quickly understand the purpose from the outset. This involves setting the stage, establishing context, and ensuring that everyone in the room understands the journey ahead. Similarly, teams need to clearly articulate the goals and objectives of their service improvements during assessments. In essence, be really transparent in what you are doing and why."

By starting the storytelling process early in the service creation phase and iteratively refining it as they progress, these teams create a seamless and authentic representation of their service\u2019s evolution. This proactive approach fosters transparency, accountability and a comprehensive understanding of the service\u2019s journey, negating the need for last minute preparation and aligning effortlessly with the service standards."
