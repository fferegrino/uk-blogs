            "text": "As this blog is published, we are onboarding our 10th service owner, 3 years into building the new profession. Service owners at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) act a bit like business partners. They bridge the gap between the Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) function and the rest of the department. Service owners make sure that we are not just a delivery function, but help inform thinking, policies and projects. "

            "text": "Having started my career in policy, I know that user-centred design and more generally digital, data and technology approaches are still primarily part of the DDaT delivery toolkit rather than policy or project development. This is a gulf that must be bridged if we want to deliver the most impactful work for the public. I also know that conversations between DDaT and policy practitioners can be at odds: we do not work at the same pace or follow the same approaches. Any collaboration is difficult at first and has to be intentional. We set out to address this challenge by building our service owner profession at DBT."

I know service ownership is making a big difference to our ability to deliver on our mandate as a department, with value for money, at a time when IT projects going wrong continue to make headlines. Over the last 2 years, our service owners have been critical in helping the department focus its activity on the highest value opportunities. They did this by making better use of data and providing a digital self-serve offer to exporters and investors. Service owners represented DDaT in the governance of the Investment Transformation Programme and the Export Support Service Programme, both on the Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). The programmes recently closed with a \u2018green\u2019 rating from the Infrastructure Projects Authority. This would not have been possible if DDaT\u2019s work had not aligned to the programme\u2019s priorities, its role in benefits realisation clearly articulated. "

At a recent global gathering of colleagues working on investment, we received this feedback which captures nicely how we try to work:\u00a0"

This gives the impression it is an established role. But the reality is that it does not exist in many departments, and where it does, it varies hugely in the shape that it takes.

While DDaT is a separate corporate function in DBT, we know that Director-Generals and Directors can only meet their policy objectives in today\u2019s world by making good use of digital, data and technology. Last but not least, the work of service owners also involves a lot of advocacy. This helps strengthen colleagues\u2019 understanding of digital, data and technology and vice-versa, policy objectives.

This often means thinking about the user, policy, strategic and operational needs and working with a range of experts and professions to deliver the best service for everyone.
