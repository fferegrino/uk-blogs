Supported by a \u00a3150,000 grant awarded through MMO's Fisheries and Seafood Scheme, this project improves the port infrastructure at the Barbican Landing Stage (BLS) in Plymouth. The installation of two additional pontoons provides new drop-off and pick-up points for a variety of recreational fishing vessels, including wildlife safaris, dual coded vessels and angling vessels."
