No doubt it\u2019s one of the most challenging roles, but also rewarding. It gives you the chance to recruit and develop nurses, influence standards and shape the quality of care. It was an immensely exciting time."

There\u2019s scope to guide the direction of nursing within an organisation but also through wider networks such as the MHN Directors Council which influences national programmes of work."

I hope this issue can be addressed so more people are able to pursue an education in mental health nursing (and other specialisms)."

Nurses and care workers come from a range of backgrounds that truly represent the diversity of our society. Without a doubt, these careers have an impact on so many lives. I think the world realised how vital nurses are to us all."

Wherever you are in your career, there are always opportunities. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask colleagues, friends or relatives how they got to where they are. Their successes could be all the inspiration you need."
