We\u2019re committing new resources to this fight and sharing more information than ever before \u2013 leading to dozens of prosecutions in 2023. Criminals should know that there\u2019s no place to hide."

The two teams making up the unit will freeze accounts and seize cash from criminals, while also building up the long-term investigations which can send them down for up to 14 years. We\u2019ve got the assets to catch you."

            "text": "We\u2019re working with the police and the law to make sure that evidence of wrongdoing supports investigations and prosecutions. We use the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover illegally gained profits and, since April 2022, the EA has had access to the Police National Computer, Police National Database and National Automatic Number Plate Recognition Service. Our strong relationship with the police has given us the means to shut down waste criminals faster.\u00a0The combined powers of the EA and the police are a force to be reckoned with."

Joint operations across the country are delivering results already."

            "text": "We continue to build new ways of working with partners across Government to shut down waste criminals. For instance, customs export data is now shared regularly with us from our partner HMRC to help identify illegal waste exports. This data helps to give us a much better picture of what is being exported where and by who to increase our intelligence picture and help identify and target criminality. Close cooperation with other government departments means there\u2019s nowhere to hide."

Through this project we\u2019re working in partnership with the shipping industry to protect the environment from harm caused by illegal shipments of waste. Industry is sharing knowledge and resources with us to prevent known illegal waste exporters from using shipping lines to facilitate their crimes. Legitimate businesses are helping us to spot you too \u2013 they see which way the wind is blowing."

            "text": "All this is delivering results and ensuring that criminals face justice. In 2023, we brought forward 52 prosecutions for waste crimes, and secured more than \u00a3400,000 in fines. On top of that we inspected nearly 1,100 locations of reported waste crime activity and closed down 585 illegal waste sites. But we\u2019re not complacent \u2013 and we won\u2019t stop shutting down waste criminals."
