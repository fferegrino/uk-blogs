These are to strengthen transparency of frozen assets in the UK and assist HM Treasury in monitoring compliance with, and detecting evasion of, financial sanctions. These measures came into force in December 2023, through the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2023. I would like to take the opportunity to explain what these new obligations mean."

This includes a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by these entities, or a person acting on behalf of or at the direction of these entities. This new reporting obligation is intended to provide the government with a more comprehensive picture of the value and nature of CBR, MOF and NWF assets held in the UK. It will enable HM Treasury to track these assets over time, enhancing the UK\u2019s ability to keep these assets immobilised."

This new requirement means Persons designated under the Russia financial sanctions regime are required to proactively provide details of their UK assets to OFSI (or their worldwide assets if they are UK persons). The government intends for this measure to be extended to the Belarus regime in early 2024."
        },
        {
            "text": "This requirement strengthens OFSI\u2019s compliance toolkit, allowing it to cross verify information provided by relevant firms and also placing accountability for asset reporting on those who are designated. We have gone further with this measure by creating a bespoke penalty threshold. This reflects the seriousness of non-compliance and ensures the UK government can penalise those who do not comply with this requirement. The civil enforcement of this measure will also be applied on a true strict liability basis where refusal or failure to report assets is an offence subject to a civil monetary penalty where it is appropriate to do so. This is regardless of whether the DP, for example, had a reasonable excuse for failing to report."

In light of Russia\u2019s aggressive actions in Ukraine, the private sector\u2019s compliance with UK financial sanctions is crucial to our sanctions remaining as effective as possible, and we thank those working across industry for playing their part."
