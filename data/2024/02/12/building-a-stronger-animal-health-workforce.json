            "text": "I have had the privilege of working in over 10 countries to date, as an academic, as a consultant and more recently as an international programme manager at APHA. I have been thinking a lot lately about how most of the work done globally in animal health, plant health or One Health could give more consideration to gender[1], since females represent half of the human population and playing important roles in human health the environment and the animals and plants they depend on. Gender blindness, the practice of ignoring differences between genders, is still an issue in public health programmes despite a long-standing recognition of gendered inequalities."

            "text": "It is only in the last decade or so that animal health experts have been questioning the potential harm of research, policy, or delivery of services which are gender-blind. The World Organisation for Animal Health Gender Task Force was only set up in 2021. The lack of gender consideration in my field partly results from the absence of research and evidence to generate meaningful guidance for gender-sensitive decision-making. This is further aggravated by the lack of diversity in the animal health workforce. When teams are composed of people from similar backgrounds, their perspectives are limited. This translates into policies, services and interventions that fail to be inclusive. Let me share with you some examples illustrating why gender matters in animal health."

The most profitable breeds of livestock (cattle, camels, and buffalo) are often under the control of men. Women are more likely to control less-profitable livestock breeds (poultry and small ruminants)."

For example, where men mainly work in slaughterhouses, they are at greater risk of brucellosis or anthrax infection because of their direct contact with the flesh and bodily fluids of diseased dead animals. Women can be more at risk of contamination from bacteria such as\u00a0Campylobacter\u00a0from handling raw products during food preparation."

For example, if a male farmer is working extra hours to manage the spread of the disease, this may in turn imply additional time that women will be at home caring for children. Or women may contribute to the increased labour on the farm or must feed farm workers working longer hours. This may have additional unintended consequences of forfeited additional income or educational advancement (if women study or work in the evenings while their partners care for children)."

In remote areas underserved by public or private qualified veterinarians, trained CAHWs can perform a limited range of veterinary tasks and popularize good husbandry practices to optimise animal production, health and welfare. In 2023, 22 out of the 30 trainees we sponsored were female. Not only are these women able to earn an income and support their families, their social status and recognition within their communities has increased drastically."
