A few years ago, DIO\u2019s role within the MOD shifted from being a \u2018landlord\u2019 to a strategic adviser and commissioning agent for our colleagues in other areas of the department. Since then, we have improved our services and modernised our commercial practices to become more responsive to market conditions, expand our supply chains and shape the infrastructure market to ensure long-term delivery for our front-line commands.\u00a0"

The strategy highlights how we will create and sustain a competitive market to deliver goods and services that meet the Department\u2019s performance and affordability needs, now and in the future.\u202fUltimately a wider range of firms bidding for DIO contracts gives us the best choice of suppliers to provide the expertise and level of service we need.\u00a0\u00a0"

We are already seeing positive outcomes from working together in this way and are better engaged with a wider supplier group. For example, we have increased the number of suppliers who subscribe to our event and industry notifications to over 3,000 and the companies we network with to over 1,100. \u00a0"
