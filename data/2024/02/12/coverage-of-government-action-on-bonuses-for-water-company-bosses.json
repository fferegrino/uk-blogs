The ban would apply to all executive board members and Chief Executives and would be expected to come into effect later this year. The ban is subject to an Ofwat consultation, which will be launched shortly and is expected to run for six weeks."

Categories 1 and 2 include the most serious pollution incidents, such as causing significant pollution at a bathing water site or conservation area."
