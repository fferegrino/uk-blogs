            "text": "I first heard about the Fast Stream when I was at university, several years before I applied in 2021. When I was made redundant due to Covid, I felt a bit lost career-wise. I saw a post about the Fast Stream on social media; the concept of being able to try out different job roles each year, whilst I found my niche, sounded like a great fit."

            "text": "I love learning new skills, taking on new challenges and meeting new people (I\u2019ve previously worked in charities, risk management consultancy and, briefly, publishing) but was also looking for some stability."

            "text": "I officially joined the scheme in autumn 2022, working as a Digital User Researcher at the Welsh Government for a year, before moving to my current placement as a Strategy and Policy Officer in Defra."

            "text": "It\u2019s been a great experience so far and I\u2019m learning a lot. Although adjusting quickly to a new post and the different ways of working, where organisational priorities etc can be challenging at times, it\u2019s taught me that I\u2019m much more resilient than I realise."
        },
        {
            "text": "And my previous career experience has been a real asset in this respect as it\u2019s made me more confident getting stuck in and taking a lead on things from the start of a placement."

            "text": "Currently, I\u2019m working on a new reporting for security metrics and KPIs, so a typical day might involve meeting with different areas in my group to understand more about the kinds of data they work with on a regular basis and thinking of creative ways to present this."

        {
            "text": "For example, I\u2019ve been teaching myself how to use PowerBI using online resources, which creates interactive visuals from data sets and makes information look more dynamic. My team have been really supportive and have made my transition into this role really smooth. Everyone is super approachable, and good at listening and supporting one another."
