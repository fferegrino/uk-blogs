This Cypher features the Tudor Crown, rather than the St Edward\u2019s Crown chosen by Queen Elizabeth II following her Accession in 1952. Her Royal Cypher was itself a change from her father King George VI."

            "text": "On each accession, the monarch will choose a Royal Cypher, or symbol to represent their personal authority. You can see the Royal Cypher in many places, for example post boxes, on police and military uniforms or on the side of official buildings."

            "text": "Forms of the crown are being gradually updated across government to reflect the monarch\u2019s choice of crown, featured in His Majesty\u2019s Royal Cypher. This includes GOV.UK, the digital home of the government, which is a hugely important part of public life in the UK. The GOV.UK crown is one of many official instances of the crown so it forms one part of this change. For this work, we\u2019re focusing on instances of the GOV.UK logo which do not include the Royal coat of arms or government departments\u2019 crests."

            "text": "We wanted to create something that was faithful to both the official heraldry and the visual identity of GOV.UK. \u200b\u200bWe redrew a simplified version of the crown, making sure it appeared clearly at smaller sizes and lower resolutions. The different proportions of the new crown meant we had to subtly tweak the GOV.UK logo\u2019s typography and spacing to complement it."

It has not been updated since the site went live in 2012, so we had to work out how to implement this change in a consistent and ordered way."

            "text": "However, this change is a cross-government effort. Although GOV.UK looks like a single thing to users, it\u2019s made up of multiple different website domains, which are owned by various government departments. These departments are required to update the crown in their locally owned services and channels."
