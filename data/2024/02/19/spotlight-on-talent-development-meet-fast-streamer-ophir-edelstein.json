            "text": "I joined the Civil Service Fast Stream in September last year, straight after finishing my master\u2019s degree in public policy. It can be hard to know exactly what you want to \u2018be\u2019 after university. Sometimes it can be difficult to break into a particular career path if you don\u2019t really have any relevant work experience."

        {
            "text": "For me, the Fast Stream was perfect as it allows me to get a range of experience in an area I\u2019m interested in, on an accelerated timescale. Having studied Politics and Public Policy at university, working for the government is of particular interest (although in many cases the scheme you choose doesn\u2019t need to be directly related to your degree)."

            "text": "I\u2019m currently in my first placement, working as a Technology Innovation Consultant in Digital, Data and Technology Services (DDTS) at Defra. The experience has been overwhelmingly positive so far."

            "text": "I have loved my first posting, and I feel I\u2019m getting valuable hands-on experience of the role (which I think is the best way to learn what\u2019s right for you; what you enjoy and what you\u2019re good at), as well as benefitting from a lot of support and training. Particularly within my team, I\u2019ve been given the opportunities to explore and do work that isn\u2019t included in my job description. While this isn\u2019t an option in all postings, it has been invaluable for my development and understanding of where I want my career to go."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s sounds like a clich\u00e9, but no two days are the same. Any individual day could include team meetings, meetings with external stakeholders, emailing our various partners to coordinate projects, doing research, writing reports, making videos, or taking part in learning and development activities."

        {
            "text": "One thing I\u2019ve particularly enjoyed in the role so far is learning how to run a consultation project. From the beginning, I was given the opportunity to lead on a project the team was involved in (with assistance from an experienced team member of course)."

            "text": "Being trusted with this level of responsibility from the get-go has allowed me to learn how to effectively communicate with stakeholders, run meeting and presentations, and coordinate between several teams, among many other skills. I know that this knowledge will be relevant in almost any other job I might have, and so am very grateful for the opportunity."

            "text": "If you\u2019ve already applied, my advice for anyone joining the scheme next year is to utilise your team. The people I\u2019ve worked with have been a real highlight of my experience."

            "text": "I don\u2019t know yet what I\u2019ll do when I finish the scheme, the magic of the Fast Stream is that it lets you try out several different roles, so you can learn what you enjoy doing. My perfect role might be something I\u2019ve not even considered yet!"
