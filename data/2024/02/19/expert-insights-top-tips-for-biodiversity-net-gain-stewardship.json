        },
        {
            "text": "When planning habitat creation or enhancement, it is vital to start with an achievable target for a site. If this first step is right, everything that follows is so much easier."
        },
        {
            "text": "Be realistic in the habitats you plan, taking the conditions of the site into account such as soil, hydrology, and future weather scenarios. For example, species-rich grassland needs nutrient-poor soil. Getting nutrient levels right for the target habitat will make creation and maintenance much easier."

            "text": "The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) has recently published Biodiversity Net Gain: Good Practice Principles for Development, A Practical Guide. It outlines ten principles for ecological restoration in the UK, focusing on habitat and ecosystem scales of restoration. It aims at practitioners in land and water management for development projects."

            "text": "When completing the plan, it\u2019s important to keep language simple and not to assume the end user has detailed ecological knowledge. Technical terms and scientific species names can be off-putting, which risks the plan being shelved and never referred to again. It\u2019s vital to be specific and to consider species when managing the habitat. For example, if coppicing scrub is required to encourage new growth, the plan should state that this needs to be outside the bird nesting season."

Many things can change during that time, such as colonisation by an invasive plant, a pollution event on site or changes in weather because of a changing climate. A good management plan is a living document, which can be updated if monitoring shows it\u2019s not having the desired results (adaptive management)."

            "text": "The key to successful BNG projects lies in setting appropriate, achievable targets. Setting realistic targets based on thorough assessment of land characteristics, especially soil properties, ensures the right habitat creation for effective nature recovery. It is also vital to have a good understanding of the local BNG market before you commit to investing in a project."

This involves planning for adaptability and resilience to address variables like climate change, invasive species, and new pests and diseases. Identifying risks, setting measurable trigger points for action, and including remediation plans in the cost plan are essential."
