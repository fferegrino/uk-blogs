In this\u00a0series\u00a0of blogs, we look at the grants available in more detail, using case studies to showcase those who have taken advantage of these opportunities, as well as highlighting the work of the RPA Grants Service Team in administering them. In this blog we meet Emma Topping who works on the Adding Value grant and Small Abattoir Fund."

            "text": "Although I\u2019m fairly new to the role, I bring my experience from RPA\u2019s External Affairs team. In that job I escalated MP complaints and correspondence, so I understand how our decisions affect farmers and their business and what impact that can have on their mental health. I see my role as being the last port of call looking at grants \u2013 what\u2019s the impact if we don\u2019t pay this grant, and how can we help the customer."

I\u2019m getting a crash course on what we do and how it impacts a farm business in real time."

            "text": "One of the things I\u2019m interested in is how we can support farmers and land managers further. I\u2019m currently looking at our pre-complaints process, such as when there\u2019s an expression of dissatisfaction that\u2019s not actually escalated to a complaint. This piece of work will look to help RPA teams identify this and then see what we can do, such as help a customer understand why a decision has been made, or take the opportunity to have a second look at what we\u2019ve done, and see if we can do it differently."

            "text": "I joined the Civil Service after my A Levels. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do and kind of fell into the Civil Service by accident. I\u2019d been homeless from the age of 15, and did my A Levels in a homeless unit. The Civil Service gave me the stability that I\u2019d missed by having to support myself in that unit from 15 to 18 years of age. Everything I\u2019ve been able to achieve and the support that I\u2019ve had during my career has been wonderful, so I never felt I needed to do anything else."

I\u2019m also a gamer \u2013 particularly Assassins Creed Odyssey. The girls typically reject everything I like, except recently the oldest has decided to like all the music I like - heavy metal and rock - and has started to come to gigs with me."
