Fast forward (I'll spare you the exact number of years, as it still sends shivers down my spine), and here I am as a Lead Engineer for the Prison Onsite Support team at the Ministry of Justice."

This involves exploring pathways for learning and development, enabling them to progress both within and beyond their current roles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Exploration of this apprenticeship gave me insight into how such a route of learning could offer a structured way to deliver training whilst allowing staff to support each other through the process, demonstrating and developing their existing skill set.\u00a0\u00a0"

We are excited to see how the team grows and develops throughout the course and into their careers moving forward. Future enrolments are scheduled throughout the year with a view to the whole team engaging in the process within the next 12 months. There is a level of commitment and enthusiasm being demonstrated towards professional development, which is great to see, and I\u2019m pleased to be able to have the opportunity to offer such prospects.\u00a0\u00a0"
