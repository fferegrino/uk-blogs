This resulted in more than 5,000 improvement actions across England, and 285 improvement actions in the Wye, being undertaken to improve farm practices. This ranges from improving storage of slurry to better management of nutrients and soils."

Furthermore, the impact of farming is not the only source of nutrient levels. Phosphorus has accumulated over a number of years and is affected by climate change, flow levels in the Wye, increased housing development as well as industrial discharges from industry on the Wye."
