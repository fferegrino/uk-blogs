It was daunting to think that my contributions could change the direction of an apprenticeship, and I was mindful of other people on the panel that seemed to have better understanding and more experience than me."

The IfATE employees were equally supportive with the administration aspect, especially when Covid-19 meant the meeting had to be switched online."

Each Panel member was able to bring their own experience to discussions and this meant that broader skills development was considered and incorporated."
