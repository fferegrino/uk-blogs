            "text": "England is a special place for seabirds. Our cliffs, beaches, marshes and offshore islands provide nest sites for around 20 species, including charismatic and iconic birds such as Atlantic puffins and northern gannets. The nutrient-rich seas contain various small fish which seabirds can prey upon. And the shallow, often sandy, nearshore waters support over-wintering \u2018marine waterbirds\u2019 including seaducks like common eiders, and various species of divers (also known as loons). Seabirds are important - not only in themselves but as an indication of the health of the marine environment."

            "text": "ESCaRP is a set of 74 actions designed to bring about seabird recovery, grouped into 19 recommendations across four themes. Each action stems from an evidence-led analysis process that factored in seabird distribution, the distribution of \u2018pressures\u2019 resulting from human activities, and the sensitivity of seabirds to those pressures (i.e. how likely they are to be negatively impacted). ESCaRP is part of the Government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan."

            "text": "Recommendations in this theme focus on reducing pressures that can impact seabird breeding success. This ranges from a lack of suitable nesting areas (for instance where climate-related processes have changed habitat type or quality) to management of human disturbance, mitigating disease outbreak and spread, and minimising predation impacts. The latter has been very successful on some seabird islands with non-native invasive mammalian predators; biosecurity measures then become the focus of maintaining predator-free status."

In the non-breeding (winter) season, when the breeding sites are largely empty, England\u2019s seas can host both breeders from English colonies as well as migrant birds from other countries."

Most fundamentally, ESCaRP recommends that key breeding colonies in England have secure funding for monitoring so that future changes can be swiftly identified and addressed. Other monitoring, for instance surveying seabirds at sea and around offshore wind farms, is also recommended."

These recommendations span the recording of mass-mortality events (so-called \u2018seabird wrecks\u2019); causes, prevalence and impact of disease; quantifying bycatch; assessment of seabird prey resources; and finally drawing these together to understand key anthropogenic drivers of change (and management needs) in more depth."

We have the recovery pathway \u2013 it is now time to walk it!"
