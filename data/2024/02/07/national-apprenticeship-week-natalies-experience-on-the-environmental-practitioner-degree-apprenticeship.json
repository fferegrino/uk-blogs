A year ago, she moved to Ely in Cambridgeshire to do a five-year Environmental Practitioner Degree Apprenticeship with the Environment Agency. It\u2019s a full-time, paid job with a finite end but, assuming all goes well, a degree at the end of it and the prospect of a permanent role with the Environment Agency. It seems like the perfect scenario for an eager-to-learn undergraduate determined to forge a career protecting the environment."

I wanted a degree, but I didn\u2019t want to go to university in the traditional way. I looked at jobs, but they all missed the educational side of things and I couldn\u2019t find anything I wanted to do."

As for the next team, I\u2019m not sure yet! The university element is really broad. I\u2019m currently looking at ecology and habitat and we\u2019ll soon be moving onto geo-science, organic chemistry and extinction and survival."

It\u2019s four days of practical application and one day of university work. The idea is that because it\u2019s an Environmental Practitioner course, they should be putting into practice with us, what they learn during their university work. We also have associate Project Management and Data Analyst apprentices who are on a shorter course of up to two years and these are people who want to work in those specific disciplines and so stay in those teams rather than move around the organisation.\u201d"

The adverts have all the information around location and what the job and programmes consist of. \u00a0We make decisions on course availability based on capacity within teams and the ability to provide the experience and support to the apprentices. There\u2019s no fixed programme and no automatic enrolment every year, it really is dependent on all the usual stuff around resource and budgets.\u201d"
