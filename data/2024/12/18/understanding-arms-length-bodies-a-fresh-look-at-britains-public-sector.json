From the DVLA handling your driving licence, to the British Council promoting UK culture abroad, these organisations touch our daily lives in countless ways. The vast majority performs independent advisory duties, and as such are relatively small organizations."

Instead of static reports filled with numbers, we've created an interactive, dynamic website where you can explore the ALB landscape yourself. You can dive into any area that you find interesting through interactive visualisations that bring the data to life. Using Quarto's capabilities, we'll keep the analysis up to date and track how users engage with the data. It's part of our commitment to making complex government information more accessible and meaningful to everyone who needs it."
