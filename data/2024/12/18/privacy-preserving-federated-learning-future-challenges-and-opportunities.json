Since the PETs Prize Challenges (July 2022 \u2013 2023), the ecosystem around these technologies has continued to develop, with a shift from more theoretical and academic conversations to greater uptake and consideration of PETs."

This includes considerations for working with real data across multiple jurisdictions. While PPFL removes the need to transfer, store or process real data centrally, additional considerations may apply when working with real data."

Building on this commitment, and on insights from our previous collaboration, The National Disease Registration Service and the US National Cancer Institute are working together over the next few months to explore how PETs can drive innovative research into rare paediatric cancers, through secure, privacy-preserving data collaboration between national disease registries. By using PETs, researchers can do cross-border data analysis without the need for data transfer or direct access; they can gain deeper insights without compromising data privacy. This activity is being supported by DSIT, the White House's Office for Science and Technology Policy, NIST, and the US Department of Energy, and coordinated with the National Science Foundation."

            "text": "Collaboration using PETs, such as PPFL, will enable researchers to work around challenges that arise from the scarcity of data in individual countries. Using a federated approach as a mechanism for querying and/or modelling data will allow researchers to analyse data on rare paediatric cancers in a privacy-preserving way. This will allow researchers to analyse information in ways that were previously not possible due to the limited availability of data (at present, no single jurisdiction has access to a large enough dataset encompassing ultra-rare tumour types to conduct such analysis on their own)."

A second workshop followed in July, in Singapore, with more opportunities to build the ecosystem to follow. This will help to foster an international community around PETs with the potential to better align and co-ordinate discussion and development on policy across the ecosystem."
