Throughout this time, we have continued to push the boundaries of how this method can support policymakers to ground policy in lived experience. This year we have broken new territory by taking our film ethnography method into \u2018the metaverse\u2019. This is part of our ongoing testing of our experimental policy design methods launched in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "While \u2018the metaverse\u2019 is still emerging, it typically includes any virtual worlds where people connect socially, usually within a 3D digital space. Many online video games, such as \u2018Fortnite\u2019 or \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019, can be classed as part of the metaverse. The popularity and potential impact of virtual worlds should not be underestimated. \u2018Fortnite\u2019 alone has an average of 1-3.5 million global concurrent users at any given time and the average \u2018Fortnite\u2019 user spends 8-10 hours per week within the game. With the growing popularity and significance of such virtual worlds, it is crucial that policymakers take them into account and include them in their evidence base. The publication of the Video Games Research Framework by Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport last year highlights the need for high-quality research in this area.\u00a0"

Tom Bolstorff\u2019s groundbreaking 2008 book \u2018Coming of Age in Second Life\u2019 showed that in-depth accounts of people\u2019s virtual lives could be just as valuable as studying their non-digital realities. More recently, documentary-makers have started capturing immersive metaverse stories, entirely shot within the digital world.\u00a0 We were inspired by the award-winning documentary \u2018Grand Theft Hamlet\u2019, directed by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, which tells the true story of two actors trying to develop a full production of Hamlet inside \u2018Grand Theft Auto\u2019. Films like these sparked our curiosity for how ethnographic films created in the metaverse could deepen our understanding of policy issues and engage communities who traditional methods may struggle to access.\u00a0"

There is still immense value in capturing in-person cues like facial expressions, body language, and physical environments. These not only reveal impactful insights about people\u2019s lived experience but can also help the researchers to create an emotionally safe space by tuning into the participant\u2019s experience during research. Observing participants in both their online and offline spaces could perhaps provide a fuller picture of their lives.\u00a0\u00a0"
