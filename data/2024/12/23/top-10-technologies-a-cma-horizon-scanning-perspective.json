To fully realise the opportunities that these technologies bring, it is important to consider the potential competition and consumer concerns that they raise. If industry, regulators and wider stakeholders are aware of these challenges then we can work together to provide more clarity and certainty so companies using these technologies have the confidence to innovate and contribute to UK growth. We recently set out at the Chatham House Competition Policy 2024 conference and the Financial Times Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit how the benefits from promoting competition are profound and far-reaching \u2013 not just for lower prices, but also to create more innovation, choice, quality, security of supply, productivity, investment and growth."

They could result in beneficial new products and services, and increased choice for consumers."
        },
        {
            "text": "The deployment of these technologies also has the potential to pose harm to competition and consumers. Larger firms may be able to restrict access to essential inputs such as data and compute or reinforce dominant positions by bundling products and capabilities across multiple sectors. This could, in turn, limit consumer choice and make it harder for new firms to enter the market to compete. There could also be negative implications for consumers if they do not sufficiently understand the performance of technologies they\u00a0depend on and are not empowered to take well informed decisions."
        },
        {
            "text": "In addition, several technologies in our list present other potential challenges for UK firms that stem from hardware integration requirements. For example, the cost and complexity of developing and deploying technologies such as quantum computing, spatial computing, and VR could result in established companies with greater access to resources having more control over intellectual property, talent, and standards in these fields. The hardware in these technologies also has potential to create new ways that sensitive consumer data could be compromised or leave firms or consumers open to cyber-attacks. It is important that the market develops in a way that benefits all players in the digital ecosystem \u2013 including large and small firms, and consumers."
