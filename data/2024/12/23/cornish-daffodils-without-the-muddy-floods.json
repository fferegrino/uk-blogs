The farm uses appropriate tillage not just to address soil compaction but also to promote beneficial microbes, which are all part of the farm\u2019s regenerative approach.\u00a0\u00a0"

ALERT takes slope, LiDAR data - which shows where water will flow in extreme weather events, and soil type to indicate the inherent risk of a field. We then discuss if a high-risk crop like daffodils should or shouldn\u2019t be grown, and if the field is suitable what in-field mitigations can be put in place to prevent any adverse impacts. \u00a0"
