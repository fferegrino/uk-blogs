A decade on there is still much to do in order to realise the full potential of a modern Britain powered by good technology. Thinking another 10 years ahead requires grasping where technology might lead public expectations and what we can put in place now to prevent the public sector from falling behind."

Their enthusiasm and engagement made me very optimistic that the amassed firepower will make good technological choices for citizens. But it is going to be very important we keep leadership engaged at the highest level. The digital transformation of public services cannot sit in one department; it has to be a joined up part of the story of what we want our country to become over the next decade. That\u2019s why the close relationship with HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office is so vital."
