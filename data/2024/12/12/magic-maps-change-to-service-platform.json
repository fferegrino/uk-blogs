The MAGIC website provides geographic information about the natural environment from across government. The information covers rural, urban, coastal and marine environments across Great Britain. It is presented in an interactive map in a web browser which can be explored using various mapping tools that are included.\u00a0\u00a0"

The data is varied and includes statutory data published by Natural England, such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Local Nature Reserves but also has data from all kinds of sources. These sources include other major governmental bodies such as the Environment Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) but we also include datasets from smaller bodies such as charities and other agencies.\u00a0"

It\u2019s a great space for not just publishing and sharing our own data, but all kinds of habitat and geographic data, allowing users to make evidenced informed decisions.\u00a0"

Once again, we\u2019ve been working on the website in the background to bring it up to date and ensure it works correctly. We\u2019re carrying out a change to the website that will update it from JavaScript version 3 to JavaScript version 4. This is an important change that will ensure it continues to function well into the future and is a more secure website.\u00a0\u00a0"

It will have a different user interface, a different appearance to the table of contents and the tools and buttons will have moved to different positions. Performance might slightly decrease on older devices as well due to RAM (Random Access Memory) but should still be entirely usable. We are also working to improve the printing facility in version 4, which will be available in coming months. For now, users will need to continue to use the JavaScript version 3\u2019s printing functionality. \u00a0\u00a0"
