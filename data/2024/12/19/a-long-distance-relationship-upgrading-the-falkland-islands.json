            "text": "Working and living in the Falklands is a unique experience. Being 8,000 miles from the UK, delivering the core contract and projects can be challenging. As well as the time difference and distance from the UK, the communications network has limitations to the bandwidth resulting in near impossible comms back to the UK. Additionally, the weather can be very harsh, leaving only a small window of opportunity available to undertake external construction.\u00a0\u00a0"

Due to a weather phenomena called \u201crotors\u201d, the air bridge is often subjected to delays or cancelations which impacts specialist contractor\u2019s availability to come to site.\u00a0"

The challenges of living and working so far away fosters a closeness and a real \u2018can do\u2019 attitude among the team. As a civil engineer by trade, Mike was interested in these practicalities of working in the Falkland Islands and how we problem solve.\u00a0"

            "text": "We\u2019re also aware that the small community, both military and civilian, means that the work we do can have an especially significant impact. This is particularly true in even more distant areas like the remote radar heads, where there is nothing for miles around, but it applies everywhere on the islands. The swimming pool improvements, for example, benefit both service personnel and their families at the Mount Pleasant Complex. Unlike in the UK where they may have dozens of other options for activities, something like the swimming pool can be extremely important for our community and it\u2019s always important for us to keep that in mind.\u00a0\u00a0"

We look forward to wrapping up a few more projects in the coming months and then I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty more to get our teeth into!\u00a0"
