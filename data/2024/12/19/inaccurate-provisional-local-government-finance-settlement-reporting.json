The provisional Local Government Finance Settlement alone ensures that no council will see a reduction in their Core Spending Power, and places with a significant rural population will on average receive around a 5% increase in their Core Spending Power. Across England, \u00a369 billion will be made available for councils - which is a real-terms increase of 3.5% from 2024-25."

The government has been clear and transparent with the full methodology of the Grant allocations available on Gov.uk."

Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that pEPR payments will amount to the equivalent to 7.8% of Core Spending Power across all shire districts, and even more for the shire districts serving the most rural areas."
