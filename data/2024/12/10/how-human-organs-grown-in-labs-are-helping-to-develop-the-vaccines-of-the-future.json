            "text": "Sometimes referred to as 'organs on a chip', but more accurately described as microphysiological systems (MPS), each matchbox-sized cassette contains a small chamber where the function of an individual human organ is replicated on a miniature scale."

            "text": "Very thin layers of human cells, taken from biopsies or donations, are grown inside the small clear chamber of each cassette."
        },
        {
            "text": "Once grown, the MPS can be infected with all types of dangerous diseases, to see how human organs respond to an infection. More complicated systems can be built by connecting cassettes with different types of organs, to mirror the internal workings of the body and understand how a pathogen might move from one organ to another."

        {
            "text": "Where appropriate, cassettes growing gut, lung or airway cells are cultivated in an atmosphere that replicates the push and pull forces and stresses of the microenvironments found within the human body."

            "text": "Although the systems started by replicating organs, UKHSA scientists are now developing the ability to focus in on protective mechanisms of the human immune system. This will allow a better understanding of how specific immune cell responses fight infectious disease, and how we can enhance or supplement that protection."
