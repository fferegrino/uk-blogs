When I went to Sandhurst, I was taught war studies by Dr Paddy Griffiths, and he used wargaming to help illustrate the classes he was teaching.

So, understanding when it's not appropriate is very important.\u202f"
        },
        {
            "text": "The key skill is to realise that wargaming is a model of whatever it is you're looking at.\u202fWhich is why it is important to use simple models that give you useful insights - as opposed to complex AI driven computer simulations that recreate all the problems of the real world, which can leave you none the wiser. Lastly, listening is another key skill, you have to be able to understand what your customer wants, and often they may not always understand it themselves.\u202f"

        {
            "text": "This isn't the case that the customers always right, because if the master question isn\u2019t right, then we're just going to waste time and money.\u202fSo it's very important to be able to listen and get behind the question that's being asked to what is the problem and what we are trying to solve.\u00a0"

        },
        {
            "text": "People want to move away from expensive and complex computer simulations. They want to be able to interact with each other and provide structure to that interaction. So we're getting games different subjects, the games are better designed and not as open-ended. Monopoly, for example, which is a ghastly game, was specifically designed to show the evils of capitalism and things like Risk, which are open-ended, are zero-sum games where only one person can win.\u202fIt's quite obvious who's going to win about halfway through, and it's just a tedious flog for everyone else who isn't winning.\u202f"
        },
        {
            "text": "So the modern trend is to design games in a more realistic and nuanced way, with many games specifically designed to last a certain time. They have mechanisms in them to balance the game and the objectives to prevent it being obvious to see who's winning and to get the game finished within a time scale.\u00a0All these makes games more accessible and useful."

            "text": "The development of prototype games can be produced cheaper and in a shorter time.\u00a0One of the overriding features of wargaming, is that it's available at short notice to look at really serious problems. Computing maybe be useful for briefings and preparatory work. If you've got a stack of information, you can get AI to efficiently summarise that into a briefing pack, because busy people need to have effective Summaries. Digital Mapping is an interesting area, there are ways of making digital maps as accessible as a paper map, but they are quite complex (and expensive). If necessary, in austere conditions, you may still have to resort to using an old pizza box and a pair of scissors to make the components."
