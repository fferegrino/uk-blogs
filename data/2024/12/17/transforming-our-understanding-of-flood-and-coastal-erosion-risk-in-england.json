In other words, we assess future flood risk based on today\u2019s infrastructure in tomorrow\u2019s climate."

Surface water flooding happens when there is so much rainwater that it overwhelms drainage systems causing surface water runoff also known as flash flooding.

The most notable being improved data and modelling methods for assessing the likely frequency of flooding."

We will be able to show users information on potential flood depths as well as future flood risk taking into account climate change.
