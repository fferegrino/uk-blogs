Through the OCPP,\u00a0Cefas have been working with these organisations to safeguard shark and ray populations through in-country workshops and training of frontline fisheries staff in species identification and data collection (see previous blog here)."

This collaboration aligns with the key challenges within the OCPP of tackling marine biodiversity and sustainable seafood."

            "text": "In 1999 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) adopted an International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks\u00a0(IPOA-Sharks). This called upon States with directed shark fisheries or those with regular shark bycatch to develop National Plans of Action (NPOA) \u201cto ensure the conservation and management of sharks and their long-term sustainable use\u201d (FAO, 1999). Plans should be reviewed and updated at least every four years, although globally adoption and compliance to this voluntary measure has been poor, with <12% of annual retained shark catch from countries with current (less than or equal to four years old) NPOAs (Gilman et al., 2024)."

Accordingly, Sri Lanka\u2019s compliance with IPOA-Sharks has been commendable with the first Sri Lankan NPOA adopted in 2013, followed by a revision in 2018 and a proposed revision to be published in 2025. This latest revision is being supported by the OCPP and was the focus of the visit kicking off with a knowledge sharing in London with the Defra Marine Species Conservation Team. The scale of the number of fishing vessels (>50,000), landing sites (>900) and sharks landed in Sri Lanka is a far cry from that of the UK and evidences the importance of a NPOA to conserve sustainable shark populations for the future. \u00a0The importance of international legislation and marrying that with national measures was discussed and will form an important pillar of the NPOA."

            "text": "A workshop held in Plymouth continued discussions on delivery against existing UK and Sri Lankan NPOAs, where objectives had been met, those falling short, challenges and identifying key areas for future development. The Sri Lankan colleagues presented results from their questionnaires which canvassed feedback from 89 stakeholders on the existing NPOA, their awareness, thoughts on issues to address and improvements for the revision. Encouragingly, 61% of the respondents believed that sharks require additional management measures than are currently in place, evidencing the willingness to engage in their protection for biodiversity maintenance, food security and future income."

We face a similar situation in Sri Lanka, compounded by the desire for economic growth and the need for food security. We look forward to the revised NPOA implemented by the DFAR in Sri Lanka as it has the potential to establish a foundation with which to encourage a shift towards sustainable fisheries that would benefit future generations of fishers while protecting biodiversity\u201d Daniel Fernando (co-founder and Director of BRT)."

Demonstrations of UK data flows from baseline fishers catch recording all the way through to stock assessments, negotiations and management measures were given and parallel discussions held regarding data flows in Sri Lanka. This was substantiated with a visit to Brixham fish market one evening where a Cefas onshore fisheries sampler gave a demonstration of how they collect data which feed into this system, by sub-sampling the landed catch to providing data on length, weight, sex and maturity of fish (including shark species)."

Demonstrations of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) to monitor catches were well received with an interest in the potential development of Artificial Intelligence in processing footage. A visit to the electronics lab at Cefas, Lowestoft cemented plans to deploy a deep-water camera system in the waters around Sri Lanka as part of OCPP, to assist in the identification of deep-water shark species inhabiting these waters \u2013 a key knowledge gap to fill as part of the NPOA development. \u00a0\u00a0"

More in-country visits are planned to continue the roll-out of training frontline fisheries staff (as described in this previous blog) in the identification of prohibited shark and ray species led by the global expert Dr. Rima Jabado as well as planned deployments of the deep-water camera. Both activities will directly align with supporting the Sri Lankan NPOA (both present and future) and in safeguarding sharks in this region."
