We found that they charge local authorities at least the same rates as registered homes, and often significantly more.

There is not enough legal provision that meets the child\u2019s specific needs. These children are usually placed alone, and the reason given is that they have complex needs. Given that many of these children are also the subject of DoL orders, this is worrying. These children are isolated and not under any regulatory oversight."
