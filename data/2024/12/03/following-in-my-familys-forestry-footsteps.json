My parents both worked in forestry, and my son David is following in our family\u2019s footsteps working for Forestry Scotland. As a family we have a deep connection to the outdoors. We want to make a difference to people, nature and the environment, and leave a legacy for the next generation."

I recall from an early age that I only ever wanted to be outdoors. I was always eager to explore my natural surroundings and to learn from my father who was then a Forest Researcher, and my mother who worked at a research station in the Forest of Dean."

However, I knew I wanted to experience more than just the hands-on work. I wanted to learn what forestry was all about."

With that ambition firmly in my mind, I knew it would be best to get a job in a related industry such as forestry, to gain some valuable experience."

As part of the Ordinary National Diploma (OND) course at Newton Rigg College in Cumbria, I spent my middle year on placement at North West Water in Macclesfield. I completed a lot of practical work during the course and achieved an OND (which later changed to a Forestry BTEC National Diploma) which would later open the door to a new chapter in forestry."

It was around this time I realised forestry was for me. When I finished college, I found 12 months of land-based work at a private estate to build on my experience and when a role at the Forestry Commission opened up, I jumped at the chance to apply. I was successful, which meant I was posted to the Llandovery district in Carmarthenshire, where I worked in timber production harvesting trees and managing heavy machinery."
