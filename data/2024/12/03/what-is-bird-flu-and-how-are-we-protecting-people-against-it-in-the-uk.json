            "text": "Avian influenza (bird flu) is an infectious disease that affects birds, caused by the influenza A virus. Birds are the hosts for a variety of influenza virus subtypes, particularly waterfowl and shore birds. All birds are susceptible to avian influenza and the virus can rapidly cause significant mortality in flocks but some species of bird show more severe clinical signs than others."
        },
        {
            "text": "The influenza viruses found in birds are not well adapted to infect humans, and human infections with avian influenza viruses are rare. However, some subtypes, such as A(H5N1) or A(H7N9), have been associated with human disease, usually in people directly exposed to infected birds or animals."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over the past few years, a particular virus has come to dominate infections in birds in the Western hemisphere, influenza A(H5N1). Globally it has also caused animal outbreaks among mink and marine mammals. In recent months, it has spread among dairy cows in the United States and there have been human cases in those working on farms with affected cattle. Both A(H5N1) and A(H5N5) have been detected in wild and kept birds in Great Britain this season. "

            "text": "The symptoms of avian influenza in humans vary. Currently, the infections in humans occurring in the US are mild with symptoms of conjunctivitis (red, sore and discharging eyes) being common. However, the infection can be serious, for example, in Cambodia there have been a number of individuals and more recently an individual in Canada who have experienced severe illness."
        },
        {
            "text": "Almost all cases of A(H5N1) virus infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds and mammals or contaminated environments. Influenza A(H5N1) continues to infect new mammals (ranging from foxes, otters and seals to cattle) and spread between them, increasing the opportunities the virus has to evolve."
        },
        {
            "text": "The concern is that these changes in the virus may at some point allow it to spread readily between people. We therefore remain vigilant for any evidence of changing levels of risk and keep this under constant review, although based on the latest evidence the current risk to the UK human population from the avian influenza virus remains very low."
