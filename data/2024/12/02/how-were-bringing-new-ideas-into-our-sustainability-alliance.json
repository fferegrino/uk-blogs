It was also the first opportunity for our new members to say \u2018hello\u2019 and to bring their ideas into the conversation."

For example, the UK was one of nearly 200 members of the Global Digital Compact earlier this year, and in the past couple of weeks COP29 has included further discussions on Green IT and \u201cIT for Green\u201d issues. I myself had a very productive meeting with the UN Environment Programme just last month, to understand opportunities for joint working with them in the future too."
