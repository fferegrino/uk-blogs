A river or lake water sample can contain thousands of genetic traces, ranging from the eDNA in living cells to the urine, faeces, and skin creatures leave behind. Different environmental conditions favour different species, so knowing which species are present can help us understand the state of our water environments."

Through a large-scale study in 2014, we established the use of eDNA techniques for assessing diatoms, a type of microscopic algae. The technique, called metabarcoding, identifies multiple species of diatoms in a single sample. This approach processes water samples with remarkable speed and accuracy \u2013 reducing months of analysis into just a few weeks."

It can even detect invasive populations before they become established.\u00a0 This new approach can also help spot at an early stage crayfish plague \u2013 a disease carried by signal crayfish that is fatal to endangered native white-clawed crayfish. By analysing eDNA from water samples, scientists testing the approach quickly caught a crayfish plague outbreak in the Meanwood Beck in January 2023, allowing native crayfish to be relocated to support population recovery.\u00a0"
