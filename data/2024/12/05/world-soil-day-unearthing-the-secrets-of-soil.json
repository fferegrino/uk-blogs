Healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable agriculture, biodiversity, and climate resilience.\u202fThis year, we delve deeper into our internal efforts to measure, monitor, and manage soil health, with three ground-breaking case studies that show our dedication to sustainable soil science. Let\u2019s hear their stories:\u00a0\u00a0"

Growing up on a farm, my passions for the soil and desire to understand soil were natured from an early age. I am deeply engaged in soil, with a diverse background in various facets of agriculture. This included contributing to research supported by the Tropical Agriculture Association, focusing on the practicality of conservation agriculture in mixed crop-livestock systems for fodder production with the African tillage Network, and contributing to advancement of soil management practice and techniques.\u00a0"

This involves visual assessment of soils on agricultural land for compaction, soil health and identifying potential or actual problems with land management. The training has equipped me with the skills to ensure I am able to identify potential or ongoing issues, discuss issues with land managers and offer advice and guidance.\u00a0"

These projects cover a range of studies such as monitoring carbon that is stored in the soil, managing harmful substances in soil, and measuring the properties of peat in farms. Our dedication to soil science is more important than ever as we face global environmental challenges. By continuously improving our methods to monitor, measure, and manage soil health, we contribute to a more sustainable future. Let's continue to nurture our earth and ensure that our soils remain healthy and fertile for generations to come."
