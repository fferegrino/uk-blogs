The Forum gathered ocean experts, policymakers, and Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs) from diverse sectors, providing a platform to engage in policy dialogue, gain hands-on experience, and build an Atlantic network. Representing the UK\u2019s National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) respectively, Dr Parvathi Vallivattathillam and Dr Lianne Harrison travelled to Ottawa for the Forum."

            "text": "An important part of the programme was the contribution from ECOPs as part of an Intergenerational Dialogue. AAORIA brought together young professionals from various fields within ocean science and policy, from research students to ocean accountants to environmental lawyers. Before the Forum began, approximately 40 ECOPs gathered to form groups of five, each guided by a mentor who was experienced in either science or policy, with the task of developing a project that could benefit the All-Atlantic community. After hours of thoughtful discussion, each team was ready to present their project proposal during a policy pitch session scheduled for the final day of the Forum."

The workshops offered ECOPs opportunities to volunteer in roles such as notetakers, rapporteurs, and science communicators. Parvathi volunteered as a rapporteur during the Coastal Resilience workshop, where the session started with keynote speakers talking about ongoing resilience projects. There were roundtable discussions, where each table\u2019s rapporteur was responsible for summarizing the key takeaways from group discussions. This was aimed at promoting an exchange of insights that spanned international perspectives."

            "text": "The high school visit was a unique highlight. ECOPs spoke with students about their journeys in climate research and other roles, answering their thought-provoking questions and discussing the importance of ocean science. This outreach session demonstrated AAORIA's commitment to education and public engagement, inspiring a new generation to think about ocean stewardship."

An ECOP who had been to a previous Forum also gave her reflections on the central importance of the ECOP programming in AAORIA. These events provided another fantastic chance to network outside the main AAORIA Forum."

This reception celebrated milestones in the fight against climate change and showcased the newly opened British High Commission building which has been designed with reused materials and low emission principles in mind."

Delegates discussed the priority needs of the Atlantic Ocean, with a large focus on collaboration with all partners that have a stake in the successful safeguarding of the Atlantic. Many shared the feeling of motivation they were taking away with them from the ideas and shared sense of action."

These ideas were also summarised into a policy brief to be considered by AAORIA\u2019s High Level Board at a later date. UK ECOPs found that this was an invaluable experience in shaping and communicating innovative ideas in a policy-oriented context."

AAORIA fostered a welcoming environment that encouraged cross-sector collaboration and truly valued the contributions of ECOPs, recognising the importance of involving young talent in high-level discussions. Rather than feeling like additional tasks, the ECOP responsibilities were engaging and enjoyable, promoting their place as integral members of the Forum. AAORIA offered ECOPs a unique blend of skill-building, community engagement, and global networking. It was a great platform for ECOPs to present their work, exchange ideas, and network with seasoned professionals. Both Lianne and Parvathi reflected that being part of this Alliance broadened their perspectives on ocean science and policy and left them with a deeper appreciation for the collaborative potential of the All-Atlantic community."
