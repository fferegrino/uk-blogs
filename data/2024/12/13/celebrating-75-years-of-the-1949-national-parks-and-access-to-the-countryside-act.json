            "text": "As Chief Executive of Natural England, this legislation is special to me as it started the journey which allowed us to come into being. It created the National Parks Commission, which later became the Countryside Commission, and then the Countryside Agency, which became Natural England when, in 2006, it merged with English Nature, another body with origins in The Nature Conservancy Council and the 1949 Act. (I can trace the start of my career back to one of those bodies, the Countryside Commission, in 1988: not quite all the way to 1949! But I was handed my own copy of the Act on my first day.)\u00a0\u00a0"

Our urban areas, and our rural areas, might have changed in the last 75 years when the act was seen as getting people out of hard-working lives into remote places, but we still see the need for the benefit of time in the beauty of nature to help us be resilient, and happier, in whatever lives we lead. In our People and Nature Survey, we saw that 92% of adults who had visited a green and natural space in the previous 14 days agreed that spending time outdoors was good for their physical health.\u00a0\u00a0"

Nearly 90 million of us visit a National Park each year, which benefits our health and wellbeing, with 84% of adults agreeing that being in nature makes us very happy. It is not just good for us, it also contributes \u00a36 billion to the economy.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0"

They encompass 20% of England's total woodland cover, and 30% of the nation's ancient woodland. They host 16 National Trails in England and Wales. These paths were also created as part of the Act, and they bring walkers (and for some cyclists and horse riders) through some of our most beautiful landscapes and other iconic places such as the River Thames.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is the newest (and will be the longest) National Trail. It passes not just through the most beautiful parts of our coastal countryside (much of it a National Park or a National Landscape) but through towns, cities, ports\u00a0 and industrial areas. Almost half is already open, and it will all be ready to walk by 2026.\u00a0\u00a0"

The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. National Parks and National Landscapes continue to play a huge role in preserving nature but they, and we at Natural England, need to shift from just preserving the nature that\u2019s left to putting nature back, looking afresh at how everybody can visit those wild places.\u00a0\u00a0"

Almost two thirds of these are managed by Natural England, but also by over 70 different partner organisations including the National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, RSPB, local authorities and a growing number of landowners and businesses. These NNR partners all work together to ensure our most important places for nature to thrive, and help people enjoy them. They are also places for experiment and learning, more important than ever as climate change forces us to look afresh at how to care for nature.\u00a0\u00a0"

The groundbreaking 1949 Act provided us with the foundations for modern nature conservation and has left us with a very valuable legacy. Ultimately though, this is not enough. Our efforts must also support sustainable economic development and ensure farming and other business can thrive and support vibrant and varied\u00a0 communities who live within or visit these landscapes."
