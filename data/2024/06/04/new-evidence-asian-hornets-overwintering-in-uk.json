Genetic analysis conducted by Fera Science Ltd on samples collected by APHA\u2019s National Bee Unit, found that three Asian hornet queens trapped last month in Sussex are the offspring of a nest that was destroyed in the area, in November 2023."

            "text": "2023 saw a record number of Asian hornets found in the UK and last month, the UK\u2019s Chief Plant Health Officer Professor Nicola Spence issued a new warning urging UK beekeepers and the public to be increasingly vigilant to the presence of Asian hornet and report any sightings as we move into the peak summer season."

The National Bee Unit continues to stand ready to respond quickly and effectively to any further\u00a0possible sightings."
