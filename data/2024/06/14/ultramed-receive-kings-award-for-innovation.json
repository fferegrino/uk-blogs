I\u2019d looked into it a couple of years ago but it was clear that at that stage we didn\u2019t meet the criteria. However, as Ultramed had grown it did now meet the criteria and I decided, with the senior management team, to apply. We had\u00a0previously won awards for innovation so it was a straightforward decision to chose the Innovation category."

A first draft was written by one individual and then the team contributed to the editing to produce the final version that was submitted. It is vital to have the different skills of the senior management team to ensure that each section is completed to the highest possible standard. There are various estimates about how long it takes to complete and these suggest between 40 and 100 hours. At Ultramed we spent approximately 60 hours but completed the application ourselves rather than using external support. Unlike some awards it is free to apply for a King\u2019s Award for Enterprise."
