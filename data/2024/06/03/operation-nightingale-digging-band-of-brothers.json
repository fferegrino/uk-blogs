The dig, which aligns with the 80th anniversary year of D-Day landings, excavated where the US Army\u2019s 506th regiment of the 101st Airborne Division were stationed in 1943 and 1944. This included now famous Easy Company who were portrayed in the TV series Band of Brothers. \u00a0"

Sgt May left Aldbourne on 5th June 1944 to go to Upottery airfield near Exeter and he jumped into Normandy on the 6th of June 1944 at the age of 29. Sgt May returned to Aldbourne and went on leave to Edinburgh and then took part in Operation Market Garden. In 1945, at Foy near Bastogne, while fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, he received a leg-wound from artillery and was medically discharged. \u00a0"
