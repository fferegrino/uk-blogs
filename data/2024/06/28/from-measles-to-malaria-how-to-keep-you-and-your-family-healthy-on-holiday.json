The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is normally given in childhood, but if you or anyone in your family has not had the MMR, you can catch up at any time. The MMR is available to all adults and children who are not up to date with their 2 doses. It is essential that you take both doses - finishing the full course offers life-time protection from measles for most people. If you are not sure if you are protected, you can check with your GP practice or arrange a travel clinic appointment to discuss."
