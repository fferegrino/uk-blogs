            "text": "The winner was Maxwell Curtis, who completed a Masters in Corporate Law from Cambridge in July 2022 and is currently studying at BPP for the Solicitor Qualifying Exams. The judges enjoyed Max\u2019s creativity in presenting his answer as a CMA merger decision."
        },
        {
            "text": "The 2 runners-up were Alex Christou who is studying economics at Strathclyde University, and Henry Rugg who wrote an essay that caught the eye of the judging panel, despite still being in Year 13 (at Dame Alice Owens' Sixth Form in North London). Henry hopes to study maths and economics at university next year and became interested in the work of the CMA when following Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the news last year and seeing the role that the CMA played in safeguarding consumer interests."

        },
        {
            "text": "Counterproductively, much of the debate concerning competition law policy is premised on the notion that businesses and consumers are on opposing sides. The polarised political climate is undoubtedly contributing to this false dichotomy. This narrative presents the CMA with a seemingly impossible task to promote the interests of both groups. Much like a football referee, it inevitably faces backlash from all directions."
        },
        {
            "text": "In reality, like most things in our complex society, the situation is more nuanced. It is not a zero-sum game. Businesses and consumers have many shared interests, which the CMA can foster by promoting a competitive market and enforcing consumer law pragmatically."

There are approximately 67 million consumers in the UK (Footnote 2), spending approximately \u00a31.4 trillion annually (Footnote 3).

            "text": "The proposed transaction would take place at a critical juncture. The UK economy is amidst a cost-of-living crisis, still recovering from the lingering effects of the pandemic. Globally, increased geopolitical con\ufb02ict is threatening the rules-based order and the risks of climate change can no longer be ignored. Adding to this mix is the rapid proliferation of generative AI, which is disrupting all sectors of the economy."

            "text": "In times of such immense challenge and profound uncertainty, the consequences of anti- competitive markets and unfair business practices are particularly severe. Accordingly, the rationale of this proposed transaction is to optimise the UK\u2019s strong competition and consumer protection regime."
        },
        {
            "text": "Not only would this deliver tangible bene\ufb01ts for consumers through lower prices (Footnote 5), it would signal that UK plc is, in fact, \u2018open for business\u2019."

        },
        {
            "text": "First, in the absence of a formal co-ordination agreement with the EU, the UK economy would face increasing isolationism from its closest long-term trading partners. There would be a lack of legal certainty, reduced investment and a downward trend in the UK\u2019s global share of supply."
        },
        {
            "text": "Second, if consumers remain largely unaware of their consumer rights and the CMA\u2019s role in safeguarding these, consumers will continue to feel helpless in seeking redress for misleading and unfair practices. Intervention will also be less impactful."
        },
        {
            "text": "Third, the merger control process will grow more adversarial and unpredictable, alienating businesses from the outset of the process. Mergers are an important source of innovation due to their combinatorial nature. Too much unpredictability in merger control can disincentivise start-ups and dampen dynamic competition. This could curtail the UK\u2019s potential as an international leader in AI (Footnote 6)."

        },
        {
            "text": "Exiting the European Competition Network has made it harder for the CMA to share expertise and coordinate investigations with the European Commission and National Competition Authorities. A formal co-operation agreement with the EU would harmonise the institutions and their processes to enhance legal certainty."

        },
        {
            "text": "Regrettably, consumers in the UK remain largely unaware of their consumer rights and how the CMA acts to protect them. If consumers do not know their rights, they cannot identify illegal practices. This proposal calls for the CMA to ramp up its educational function alongside its enforcement. For example, by entering partnerships with consumer advocacy bodies and launching more digital campaigns. With more informed consumers, unfair trading practices could be deterred without the CMA\u2019s involvement. Furthermore, the CMA would intervene in areas where consumers have expressed greatest concerns, leading to more targeted and impactful enforcement."
        },
        {
            "text": "Ongoing monitoring of potential loopholes is also imperative to effective consumer protection. For example, despite the CMA\u2019s open letter to grocery retailers on unit pricing (Footnote 7), various retailers continue to conceal unit prices for goods which are on \u2018special\u2019 through a loyalty scheme."

        },
        {
            "text": "A merger inquiry is fundamentally a fact-\ufb01nding mission. The process aims to uncover the true rationale behind a transaction and how it is likely to affect consumers. However, much of the process is dominated by lengthy written submissions, and opportunities are limited for in-person meetings with key stakeholders until after substantive decisions have been made. This can result in material facts emerging late in the process, frustrating all parties involved and wasting important public resources."
        },

            "text": "Opportunities for early engagement would also be enhanced if case teams comprised of staff with (\u2018in-house\u2019) business experience from a range of different industries. Merging businesses could then exercise their right to be heard more meaningfully, reducing antagonism and leading to more pro-active future engagement with the CMA."

        {
            "text": "With the imminent introduction of the DMCC, and the emergence of new forms of market power in AI, the proposed transaction would take place at a watershed moment. The CMA\u2019s ability to align consumer and business interests by promoting a well-functioning competitive environment has never been more important."
        },
        {
            "text": "The CMA has a successful track record of preventing anti-competitive industry consolidation (Footnote 8), sanctioning anti-competitive conduct and championing consumer rights. However, by \u2018clearing\u2019 the proposed transaction and adopting the above proposals, the CMA can unleash the competitive potential of a revitalised UK plc."
