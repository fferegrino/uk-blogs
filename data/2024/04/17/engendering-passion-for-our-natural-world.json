It encompasses 582,578 square miles of the Pacific Ocean, which equates to just 0.004% of the world\u2019s oceans. Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea supports incredible biodiversity, providing homes to many rare species such as the green turtle.\u00a0"

Toby reminds us that \u201cbeneath the figures there are beating hearts\u201d - we can often reverse the damage, and we can forge a future that is better. Positive work is being done, but we need to ensure solutions get more attention to enable larger scale results.\u00a0"
