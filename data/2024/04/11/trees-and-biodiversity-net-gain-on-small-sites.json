When considering which trees you want to retain on site, it\u2019s important to consider all survey results \u2013 for example, a tree with a low amenity value, doesn\u2019t automatically have a low biodiversity value.  You should always ensure that retained trees have sufficient space above and below ground for their roots and branches to grow once the development is finished.\u00a0"

As well as helping with your BNG requirements, trees have been shown to have a positive impact on the desirability and sale price of new properties.\u00a0"
