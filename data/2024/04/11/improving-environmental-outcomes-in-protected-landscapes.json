In the first two years it has engaged around 5,000 farmers and land managers who have planted more than 100 miles of hedgerow and 100,000 trees, created or restored 262 ponds, undertaken positive management on 27,000 hectares of Sites of Scientific Interest, created or better managed 90 miles of footpaths and approved around 200 projects delivering educational access.\u00a0"
