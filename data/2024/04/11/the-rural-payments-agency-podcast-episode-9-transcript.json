I\u2019m Caroline Ling and in today\u2019s programme we discuss the opening of the claim window for existing Countryside Stewardship revenue and Environmental Stewardship agreements with Countryside Stewardship Processing Manager Gregg Bulman. We also have a preview of the shows and events that RPA will be attending with Katie Yon from the events team and Caitlin Smith from the Grants Service team also talks about the new round of the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund. And in a special interview we\u2019re joined by RPA\u2019s Customer Director Marie Hardeman, who talks about her first year with RPA and what is coming up in the customer area over the next few months."

Both Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship provide financial incentives for farmers, foresters and land managers to support sustainable food production whilst looking after the environment by implementing measures that increase biodiversity, grow habitats, expand woodland areas, improve water quality and enhance natural flood management."

If you miss this deadline, you still have until Wednesday the 2nd of September to submit a claim, but a reduction will be applied to the value of your claim \u2013 the later you submit it, the greater the reduction, so I would encourage eligible farmers to submit their claims\u00a0 before the deadline to ensure they\u2019re rewarded for their efforts to produce food sustainably while improving the environment."

This will remain available in the Rural Payments service for 2024, with farmers able to generate and submit an automated revenue claim with a single click without needing to complete each section of the claim form. \u00a0There\u2019s a video available on YouTube called How to submit a revenue claim using the Rural Payments portal which is worth watching.

        },
        {
            "text": "Gregg: Yes that\u2019s right. We want to remind farmers that those who wish to transfer some, or all, of their \u2018reference amount\u2019 for delinked payments to another business, must do so by the 10th of May 2024. For example, farmers may wish to do this if their business has split, merged with another business or been given a new Single Business Identifier since they were paid BPS 2020."

        {
            "text": "Gregg: Yes of course. The RPA replaced the Basic Payment Scheme in England with delinked payments which will be paid each year from 2024 to 2027. Advance payments will be made to farmers of around 50% from the 1st of August and the balance of the payment from the 1st of December. There\u2019s no need to apply for delinked payments, but farmers should be aware that the amount you receive will decrease each year as the progressive reductions are applied. It\u2019s calculated based on a \u2018reference amount\u2019 which will normally be the average of your BPS payments made for the 2020 to 2022 scheme years. You must have claimed, and been eligible for, BPS payments in England in the 2023 scheme year, except for some inheritance cases."

You can search for \u2018How to make a capital or revenue claim for Countryside Stewardship,\u2019 also \u00a0\u2018How to get paid under an Environmental Stewardship agreement\u2019 and further information about the delinked payments transfer period can be found on the RPA blog via the blog post, \u2018Delinked payments guidance: information about transferring reference data.\u2019"

The Farming Equipment and Technology Fund has three grants to help farmers buy items to improve productivity, manage slurry and improve animal health and welfare. \u00a0You can apply for more than one grant, for items that suit your\u202fbusiness.\u00a0\u00a0Under the Productivity element you can apply for a maximum of \u00a350,000 and this focuses on improving agricultural sustainability and horticultural and forestry productivity, helping farmers use less inputs, reduce emissions and cut waste. The Slurry grant is also a maximum of \u00a350,000 and this helps farmers to improve their slurry management and maximise environmental benefit. The Animal Health and Welfare grant gives a maximum of \u00a325,000 which will offer improvements in the health and welfare of livestock, potentially helping farmers improve biosecurity or decrease environmental stress."

This year applicants will be able to use the new service making it easier to apply for the grants. Applicants will need to be quick though, the first application window for productivity and slurry grants will close at 12 noon on 17 April.

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time out and about meeting our customers and that\u2019s been varied because we deliver support to so many agricultural and rural communities, so from fruit and veg growers and traders, to small family farmers, right through to really large land owners and huge agricultural organisations and then it\u2019s been inspiring because everyone I\u2019ve met has been really passionate about what they do and really honest about the challenges the sector faces and how we at the RPA can impact them, positively and negatively, if we\u2019re not getting it right, and no matter how challenging their circumstances are, everyone I\u2019ve met has been welcoming and really wanting to work in partnership with us to shape our services. I\u2019ve met many organisations and stakeholders who provide services to our customers and that\u2019s a really great community of people who also want to work in partnership with us. It\u2019s been my first year at RPA, so as well as being my first year in the role, it\u2019s been my first year working with colleagues and another observation would be that the passion and the willingness to deliver great outcomes has been shown right across the agency. Everyone I work with has been welcoming, supportive and is genuinely motivated by wanting to provide a great service."

We\u2019ve supported thousands of customers this year to access funding so as well as continuing to deliver funding through existing schemes, we\u2019ve delivered a variety of new schemes and new grants. We\u2019ve then improved how our customers can contact us, how they can get through to the right person on our telephone lines or by web chats, how they can tell us about information and changes and then how we can better direct their queries or information they\u2019re sharing with us to the right people. We\u2019ve increased the way we share information to reach more customers, so this is things like our newsletters, videos to show guidance, videos to share real life examples from customers on how they\u2019re using our funding to deliver great outcomes and then of course things like this podcast. I talked about our stakeholder community and we engage with a large number of stakeholders and that\u2019s a really important group. Some of our customers choose to be members of these organistions and some choose to use land agents, for example. So in the last year we\u2019ve increased how much we get out and about, whether that\u2019s at shows and events or whether it\u2019s how we inform and engage with our stakeholders through meetings and workshops and getting out and about in our rural communities. In the last year we launched our farmer panel and that\u2019s really important for us to gather insight but also test some of those improvements that we\u2019re making and we\u2019ve increased our customer insight activity. So, what I mean by that is how we capture feedback from that broad group of customers I talked about, in different ways and at different parts of their interaction with us. We get feedback in such a variety of ways \u2013 direct, so say from a customer survey or from the farmer panel or perhaps a social media comment, but also indirectly through our data and our performance information, and from colleagues out in the field or taking calls from our customers. So we\u2019re improving how we pull all that together to help drive improvements across our services."

So, as well as collecting feedback through surveys and engagement as you\u2019ve mentioned, I know that you\u2019re very keen on listening to customers by visiting farms, talking to farmers and making sure their voice is heard. How\u2019s that allowed you to make improvements?"

            "text": "Marie: It\u2019s really helping us to shape how we deliver services. So far it\u2019s helped with probably quite individual things, so we might have shared some guidance with customers to get their feedback on \u2018does that makes sense to them, do we need to make any changes?\u2019 We\u2019ve involved our customers in how to improve our mapping function, although there\u2019s a lot more work that we can and will be doing to improve mapping. So far it\u2019s been helping us shape how we deliver individual things. Moving forward we\u2019re talking to our customers about what they want overall from us as an agency and how we can better shape our end-to-end customer services."

            "text": "Caroline: This is all great to know, I and RPA\u2019s customers would also like to know how you\u2019re ensuring that the people working for you have the right skills to deliver the customer service that farmers, agents and landowners need?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Marie: That\u2019s a really interesting question because we are changing the types of services that we need to deliver to our customers and how we deliver those and it\u2019s really important that we upskill our colleagues across the agency to be able to deliver those changes, so a really good example of that is things like our field officers. Previously under EU funding we\u2019ve had to inspect and check compliance against agreements. While it\u2019s important to ensure that our public money is being used for good, \u00a0we want to move more towards supporting our customers to deliver those brilliant outcomes, helping them to get it right, preventing mistakes happening, so that\u2019s a real shift in what\u2019s expected of our field colleagues. I talked earlier about the increased funding streams that we\u2019ve provided, whether that\u2019s schemes or grants. All of that means that our colleagues, on the telephones or in the fields, need to be more informed to advise, guide and support customers, so we\u2019re keen to upskill our contact centre colleagues so that they can provide accurate and useful information to our customers. With all of that we also need to provide the technology to support colleagues in delivering those services."

        {
            "text": "Caroline: Thanks Marie. And what about giving customers a choice in how they engage with RPA \u2013 one size doesn\u2019t necessarily fit all?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Marie: Absolutely. We\u2019ve talked a little bit today about the different customer groups that we provide support to, and what that means is that different customers want to contact us in different ways at different times of the day or the week and for some customers the type of service they like differs, so whether they want \u00a0to be able to self-serve that information without needing to talk to a person, they want to be able to get information quickly, tell us of changes quickly at a time that\u2019s convenient for them, or whether it\u2019s face to face contact in the field or whether they want to speak to that person about multiple things to do with their farm or business, so one of the things we\u2019re looking for in the next 12 months is to look at the best contact model we can provide, both in the field, over the phone or through our customer portal, how do we provide the right contact model for all of the customers we\u2019re trying to support, so we absolutely want to give customers a choice in how they engage but we also want to make sure that whatever way they choose, they receive a consistent and a great service."

        {
            "text": "Caroline: Thanks Marie, that\u2019s been really interesting. Just one final question \u2013 is there anything RPA has planned for this year that you\u2019re introducing that\u2019s going to enhance the customer service RPA provides?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Marie: I think the biggest thing will be our contact model, so improving how we engage with our customers. We\u2019d really like to give customers a choice in how they engage with us. I talked earlier about all the different customer groups that we provide support to. They all have different ways of wanting to contact us, perhaps the time they\u2019d like to contact us and then the type of service they\u2019d like. So for some customers they\u2019re quite happy to self-serve information and to tell us of changes without necessarily talking to a person, whereas for others they\u2019d like more complex support, they\u2019d like to talk to a person, whether that\u2019s in the field or over the phone, so we\u2019d like to improve how we engage, how we support customers to deliver those outcomes and how we make it easier for customers to get the information and support they need from us. Also a big part of that is how we use our customer insight and how we engage with customers to help us improve that, so really getting customer feedback to help us shape and design those services."
