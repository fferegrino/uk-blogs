As part of the business, Shropshire Petals grows a wide range of sustainable petal confetti for weddings and dried flowers for home d\u00e9cor and gifts. The flowers are grown during the summer months and picked by hand, then dried on the Shropshire farm, from which they\u2019re then delivered worldwide."

The droids now drill and manage 20 hectares of flowers - where they weed and drill the field completely, powered by four large solar panels that provide enough energy to keep the robots working for 18-25 hours, with no need to stop to refuel or charge."

The robots weed the flower fields continually once the planting is complete and therefore weeds will never grow big enough to out-compete the flower plants."
