Though the final recommended rate is agreed by Low Pay Commissioners through a negotiated process, \u00a0we can still provide guidance on what kind of increases are consistent with our remit from the Government. To do this, we project a range for next year\u2019s National Living Wage (NLW, the minimum wage for workers aged 21 and over). This is currently \u00a311.65 to \u00a312.18, with a central projection of \u00a311.89, although forecasts could change over the year. In this blog, we\u2019ll explain how we make this projection and how it relates to the recommendations Commissioners will make in the autumn."

We make our recommendations in October each year, and the new rates come into force the following April. Our recommendations cover both the NLW for workers aged 21 and over, and separate rates for young people and apprentices. For these latter groups, the Government has asked us to raise the minimum wage as high as possible without damaging the employment prospects of the affected workers. For the NLW, though, our approach is different."

Having reached the two-thirds target, in this year\u2019s remit the Government asks us to maintain the NLW at two-thirds of median hourly pay in 2025."
