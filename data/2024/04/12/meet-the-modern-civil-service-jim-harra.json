The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are driving innovation, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs across the UK."

Jim Harra is also the Civil Service Digital and Data mission sponsor."

            "text": "I think a skilled, innovative and ambitious civil service is what we're aiming for. Given the mission that I sponsor, the Civil Service needs to harness the power of digital services, data and technology, and really use those to drive better public services and help ministers make better decisions and better protect the country."

            "text": "In HMRC especially, a lot of the digital services that we have developed have been about enabling customers to complete the transactions that they need to do, online on gov.uk or the HMRC app. Increasingly, we are expanding that to enabling customers to obtain the information and guidance they need. We still receive a huge amount of contact from customers seeking information or guidance from us over the phone. We receive around 38 million calls a year, for example, to our helplines, and many customers still contact us by post as well."

            "text": "Customers call for a number of reasons, such as checking whether they've filed their taxes right and correcting any errors that they make. The digital transformation that\u2019s happening is about modernising the way people can find out what they need. We\u2019re encouraging customers to use our online digital assistant to find the information they need, and if necessary, get further help from an HMRC webchat advisor."

We've been implementing a programme called Making Tax Digital, which is about requiring businesses to use business accounting software to keep accurate records, which speak directly to our systems and upload to them. We've implemented that for VAT and we will be implementing it from 2026 for income tax, and that will bring in about 5 billion pounds additional revenue by the end of 2028-29 through helping people make fewer errors."

            "text": "This will enable my colleagues to focus on the higher-end compliance cases and free them up from dealing with that simpler error that can be dealt with through digital solutions. The next stage, I think, is using our own systems and that proprietary accounting software to build on our risk assessment, and our nudges and prompts, to help people get it right and help prevent error."

We can achieve this if we are innovative and if we focus on the citizen or the business rather than on our organisational boundaries within the Civil Service."

At the moment, I think two departments exchanging data is much, much more painful than it needs to be.\u00a0"

Some technologies and concepts have come and gone in my career and not all of them have been very useful. But it feels like generative AI really is going to make a difference and that we're on the cusp of a revolution."

            "text": "I think it will help us to be more productive and to do our jobs better and provide better services. We are looking at some use cases in HMRC about how we can use AI internally to help our people be more productive. For example, we've been testing using generative AI to write up the summary at the end of a helpline call, which saves the advisor from having to do that and enables them to get on to helping the next customer. We have also been working with GDS to test a gov.uk chatbot that will use generative AI to help customers even faster."

            "text": "But we also know that when it comes to operational data there are always challenges with the quality of it, and therefore there are always risks that whatever system you put on top of it will not produce the right answer. I think we'll have to think through as we roll out customer-facing generative AI, what our stance is for when our systems don't give the right answer to the citizen."

You demonstrate your use and need for it, and how you will meet all the security and data and protection standards if that's required, and then have a sort of hub for subscribing for that data and picking it up at the moment you need it. Right now, it\u2019s too bespoke and takes too long and costs far too much compared with, I think, an industrialised process of accessing shareable data.\u00a0"

We've got a lot going for us in terms of the experience that we can give people in the digital and data profession as well as the terms and conditions and the great purpose that they can serve. As an organisation, we've got to keep building on that and keep attracting the brightest and the best people.\u00a0"
