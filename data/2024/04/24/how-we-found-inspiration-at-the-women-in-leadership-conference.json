I am relatively new to leadership roles, so it was very useful to learn about personal leadership styles during Emily Miles\u2019s talk. She is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Food Standards Agency and gave some good guidance on how to deal with people who disagree with you. Emily recommended making sure they can see you are hearing them and finding a way to move things forward. I will try this when I get the opportunity.\u00a0"

She was asked how she knew it was time to apply for her next challenge. Her response was that she followed her instinct, her gut and that spoke to me a lot. As a leader, I place a lot of value in following my intuition. I actively listen to how my teams and colleagues are feeling and what they are experiencing. This allows my next steps to be informed by more than just external demands. I hope every woman continues to channel that self-belief and push themselves to achieve great things.\u00a0"

In particular, one speaker shared their journey dealing with their leadership style being questioned. This led to them realising self-doubt can be a huge positive when it comes to seeing the bigger picture. Participating in the breakout sessions also encouraged me to interact with lots of individuals from a range of different departments. This helped me build strong networks across the Civil Service.\u00a0\u00a0"

Warming up our vocal cords before meetings had some appeal, but I decided perhaps best completed in privacy. Hearing about negotiating skills based on listening, mirroring, and compromising was most useful."
