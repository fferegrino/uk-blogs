This is part of a series of FCS definitions Natural England is publishing, endorsed by Defra in 2015, to help Local Planning Authorities and other statutory bodies where protected species are potentially impacted by development."

Known as 30x30, this latter target is an overarching commitment of the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan and key to Natural England\u2019s mission of building partnerships to achieve thriving Nature for people and planet."
