            "text": "In this blog post, Stacey explains why the service wants to work with schools and trusts to ensure they are getting not just value for money, but wider social value from their procurements, and why schools shouldn\u2019t be afraid to ask suppliers what additional value they can bring to the table."

            "text": "When we talk about value we mean it in the broadest sense of the word, including benefits through economic, environmental, or social outcomes. Social value should not risk good value but should be part of the overall value for money of a contract."

            "text": "Schools and trusts are at the heart of their local communities, and we want to help you get even more social value from your contracts. You have significant spending power, especially when working together. Suppliers want your business, so be clear about what additional value they can bring to your school or trust and build it into your pre-procurement planning."

            "text": "When a supplier responds to your invitation to tender they will have to demonstrate how they will meet your social value requirements, as well as your financial requirements."

            "text": "One example of how Get help buying for schools can help with this is through the changes we have made to our catering quality questions, to include social value questions. This will enable a school or trust working with us to pick the most appropriate social value outcomes, such as demonstrating how the supplier will reduce their carbon footprint of food supplies, improve energy efficiencies, minimise waste and recycling, and reduce single use plastics. These questions are scored and are monitored through contract management and KPIs."

It is important to consider social value at the point of building your specification so you can use it as part of your evaluation process. Be bold and be clear to potential suppliers about what would add additional value to you and your community."

        {
            "text": "Most important of all is the contract management phase, where the social value outcomes promised in the tender bid can be demonstrated and managed. Holding suppliers to their commitment is key."
