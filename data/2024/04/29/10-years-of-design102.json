            "text": "Back in 2013, when I was working as Head of Corporate Communications at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), we had a small design team who were increasingly being asked to help out other departments. This was around the same time as the launch of the Government Communication Service (GCS), and in light of their focus on developing centres of excellence, we identified the opportunity for a shared service to meet the growing demand for design services across government. We merged the small in-house design teams at MOJ, Home Office and Cabinet Office, and in 2014 Design102 was created with the aim of bringing excellent design to the public sector."

Since then, we have grown into an agency of 70 staff, providing services across a range of creative and strategic disciplines including design, artwork, animation, videography and photography, copywriting, web building, strategic planning, and client services. Public sector communications and the needs of our clients are ever-changing, and we\u2019ve always grown to meet those demands."

            "text": "First, it\u2019s our relentless focus on quality. We know we have to be as good as, if not better than, the alternatives. We set ourselves up to operate like a design agency, and it was our goal to showcase what could be achieved with design inside government. Second, it\u2019s our high level of client service. Being internal to government, we know we have a unique position and perspective to offer. We are able to understand our clients\u2019 problems and the challenges and opportunities to solving them better than anyone else."

            "text": "We\u2019ve delivered over 11,000 projects since we started in 2014, so picking just a few is challenging. But there are some that stand out. One of our first big branding projects was for the UK Space Agency\u2019s Principia mission, which saw Tim Peake spend six months at the International Space Station. It was exciting to create a brand for such a high-profile endeavour. Another stand-out campaign we worked on was for the introduction of 5p carrier bags. It was a big challenge to change the behaviours of a nation, but it was incredibly rewarding to see our work so visible in public spaces. Finally, I\u2019d also mention the ongoing work we\u2019ve done to support the GREAT campaign over the past decade, helping them showcase the best of the UK across the world \u2013 from legal services and education to food and science."

            "text": "Since the very beginning Design102 has aimed to demonstrate the quality of design that can be produced within government. We have always believed that public sector communications matter, and that we should be doing everything we can to make them as good as they can be. This includes harnessing creative talent from within. There are now more departments than ever before employing their own designers, and Design102 will continue to trailblaze to show what government communications can achieve \u2013 be it trialling new and exciting technologies or continuing to champion the highest standards of accessibility."

Some have been with us since the very start of our journey, and some are just beginning their partnership with us. To them I\u2019d say, thank you for believing in us. We work in true partnership with our clients, and I hope we continue to do so for many years to come."
