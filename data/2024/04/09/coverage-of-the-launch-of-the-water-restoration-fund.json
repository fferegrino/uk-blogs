The Water Restoration Fund will now offer grant funding on a competitive basis to support local groups, farmers and landowners and community-led schemes, bolstering their capacity and capabilities for on-the-ground projects to improve the water environment."

These changes will deliver a proportionate punishment for operators that breach their permits and cause pollution. Though we aren't in a position to pre-empt future regulatory action or court decisions, this increased scrutiny will likely result in future increases in the funding ringfenced for the environmental improvements from water company penalties."
