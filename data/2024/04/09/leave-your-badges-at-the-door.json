Our aim is to identify how to define, quantify, and measure the planetary impacts from UK Government digital services and technology, and produce a set of recommendations for the future procurement of technology and services."

There are a huge number of frameworks and different organisations working across the sustainability pillars.

There are a huge number of impacts that the tech industry has on our planet, both in terms of the biosphere and on society, touching on our oceans, biodiversity, land, and we're all dependent on them. We want to consider the impacts that our end-to-end cycle of technology has, from mineral extraction, all the way through to use of equipment, and then end of life."

It's not a 'you' and 'us' scenario, between government and the tech partners. So, we've started to wrap our arms around everybody to come together as a group, and we feel a real success in building that momentum and moving forward; people clearly want to do something about it."
