It means that a conversation begins between digital and policy colleagues that may never have happened otherwise. The spend control lever means that there is also a means of controlling how the delivery of the digital work progresses. There are gateways where assurance can take place (including assessments against the Service Standard) so we can steer anything that might be going off track. So far so procedural.\u00a0\u00a0"

We fully unpack pieces of work that come our way, taking them back to the key aspects of problem, intent and user need. Stepping outside our purely digital box, this highlights a relevance of digital thinking in wider policy work. But doing this right requires something a bit special.\u00a0"

To do this well requires \u2013 amongst other things \u2013 legitimacy and people skills. Luckily, the team is hugely diverse in its experience \u2013 full of skills in product management, content design, service assessments, delivery management, user research, service design and more. It\u2019s also a group who embrace (and dare I say it, enjoy) the opportunity to talk digital with anyone who\u2019ll listen (and even those that will not). There are some key pillars of how the team think and work that make these interactions hugely valuable in the wider mission of spreading digital thinking:\u00a0"
