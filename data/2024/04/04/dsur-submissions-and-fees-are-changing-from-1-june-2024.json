From 01 June 2024, ASRs such as the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) will not be considered valid unless you provide proof of payment of the DSUR Review Fee with your submission. To avoid late submissions and non-compliance with the requirements of Regulation 35 of SI 2004/1031 (as amended), please ensure you consider the guidance below and on our webpages."

A review of your current clinical trial portfolio and DSUR submission due dates may be useful to identify which DSUR submissions will be affected by this change and require additional oversight to ensure their submission to the MHRA is valid."

Inspectors take a pragmatic approach when reviewing change controls within an organisation and including whether they were implemented in a timely and effective manner. Every effort should be taken to manage this change and ensure annual safety report submission timelines are met. Should any issues with submissions be encountered, these should be documented contemporaneously, rectified with appropriate corrective and preventative actions and documentation retained in the Trial Master File.\u00a0 A deviation should be raised within the quality management system if appropriate."
