Inspectors take a pragmatic approach when reviewing change controls within an organisation and including whether they were implemented in a timely and effective manner. Every effort should be taken to manage this change and ensure annual safety report submission timelines are met. Should any issues with submissions be encountered, these should be documented contemporaneously, rectified with appropriate corrective and preventative actions and documentation retained in the Trial Master File.\u00a0 A deviation should be raised within the quality management system if appropriate."
