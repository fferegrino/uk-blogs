But there are a surprising number of ways to generate BNG within small developments. What\u2019s great is that with mandatory BNG, we\u2019re exploring all possible options to enhance and create wildlife habitats within small developments."

Even if wildlife habitats cover small areas, they can create stepping-stones throughout a locality as well as refugia for wildlife. This needs an integrated approach to BNG and landscape designs, and the best, most efficient way is for ecologists and landscape architects to collaborate from the start."

There is an increasing range of green walls, urban planters such as for lamp posts and bike racks and other GI features that can fit a variety of developments. All add-up to create more green space."

There are many case studies demonstrating biodiverse SuDs within a variety of small-scale development settings. This makes for a great link between BNG and SuDs, and it\u2019s key to consider this join-up from the start."
