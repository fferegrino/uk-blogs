An evaluation report published in April marked the completion of a cycle of delivering an incredibly complex and ambitious public project. Here is a peak behind the curtain and the huge amount of work that went into organising the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.\u00a0"

For anyone watching the 12 days of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in the summer of 2022, you could see a vibrant community enjoying the spotlight that it created. From the streams of spectators and queues for merchandise to the new elite performance venues, and the nearly 5,000 athletes from 72 Commonwealth nations and territories coming together in a show of sporting thrills and diplomatic shared purpose.\u00a0"

The Games came in on time, without compromise of standards, and not only on, but under its \u00a3778 million budget \u2014 with the \u00a370m underspend reinvested to communities in the West Midlands for future projects. This all ensured it could close with a comfortable \u2018green\u2019 Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) rating, achieved by 15% of government projects."

The programme had to be delivered in a condensed preparation period of 4.5 years (a consequence of Birmingham stepping in to host after the South African host city, Durban, withdrew with financial and delivery challenges). It then encountered the effects on the labour market post-Brexit; the Covid-19 pandemic, which impacted construction, costs, and workforce; significant global supply chain disruptions; the long-standing budgetary stresses within the city itself; and the wettest winter in the West Midlands for a century (just as the groundworks started on infrastructure projects). And yet despite all of this, the evaluation of the Games shows that the benefits of major event delivery can still stack up.\u00a0\u00a0"

Over 1.5 million tickets were sold, and 6.9 million people engaged with the Games as athletes, workforce, artists, volunteers, spectators or through community or schools engagement. The reach was further extended to the wider UK and globally, with 834.9 million TV viewers; 215 million digital views and 141 million interactions on social media."

Anecdotal feedback tells of volunteers making lasting friendships and gaining new jobs from the skills they learned. The majority of stakeholders reported a substantive impact on residents\u2019 civic pride \u2014 that the region could struggle with a sense of identity, and that the Games had shifted this feeling sharply. One reported that the mechanical Bull, which appeared in the Opening Ceremony and now has a permanent home in the midst of Birmingham New Street station, \u201cnow marks the place\u201d. \u201c[It] is the icon of the Games, and a reminder of how great it was...

Many members of the team were redeployed rapidly to support Operation London Bridge, and then took on roles in the team assembled to lead the Coronation, as well as supporting the international AI Summit.\u00a0"
