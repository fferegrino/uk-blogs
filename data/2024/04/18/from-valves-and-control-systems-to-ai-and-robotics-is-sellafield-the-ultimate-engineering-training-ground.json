The ability to adapt, innovate and apply the latest advanced engineering techniques has always been a skill engineers at Sellafield have needed \u2013 all whilst retaining skills to work with older technologies. In this sense, the role of an engineer at Sellafield is very similar to previous years."

We are the people who want to buy a 50-year old car and tinker with it, maintain it, fix it and find solutions to keep it in good working order.
