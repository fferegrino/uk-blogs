Ideally this would be an open standard, that enables data to be shared through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This would streamline processes, reduce manual errors, and improve efficiency. Having APIs that are open and consistent is also critical to tackling sub-optimal market conditions (for example, by making it easier for councils to switch products) and allowing the integration of new open-source or off the shelf technology modules."

Our ambition is to tackle critical standards in other policy areas within the next few years as part of an ongoing initiative.

We\u2019ll also be including councils and suppliers in our delivery teams - more on this to follow!\u00a0"
