The officers used an optical gas imaging (OGI) camera to identify the diffuse emissions of biogas as part of their investigation and identified that there was approximately 300 m3/day of biogas emitted to atmosphere. There is a significant proportion of the biogas that is comprised of methane. As a result of this work, the water company took steps to deal with this diffuse emission. The water company proposed to enclose the post AD storage tank to capture the gas as a fuel for the onsite combined heat and power (CHP) plant used to power site operations. This is a good example of how the Environment Agency has used the OGI cameras to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a potential odour source.\u00a0"

A review of an oil well site in the south of England identified an unacceptable level of associated gas venting at the site. Using our guidance, we required the operator to assess whether the vented gas could be utilised, rather than wasted. As the site is remote and some distance from potential electrical and gas grid connections, the operator determined that a gas compression and bottling scheme would be feasible. The scheme would allow the export of gas in cylinders for use as a fuel at other sites. The gas utilisation system is now installed and operational, saving approximately 12,250 tonnes CO2e a year.\u00a0"
