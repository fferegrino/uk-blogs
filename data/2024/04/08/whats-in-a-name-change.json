            "text": "It\u2019s been around six years since many of us came together to form Digital, Data, and Technology Services (DDTS). Essentially the process brought together Information and Communications Technology (ICT) teams and functions from Core Defra, the Rural Payments Agency, Natural England, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Marine Management Organisation and the Environment Agency to create a single Defra group ICT function."

            "text": "Since then, the role of security in Defra group has become increasingly important. As the digital world has evolved, so have the threats to our services and information and the responses and protection we need to be able to offer.\u00a0 Likewise, as Defra\u2019s property estate has expanded, so have its physical and personnel security requirements."

            "text": "In recognition of this fact, as of this week, DDTS will stand for Digital, Data, Technology, and Security. A small change, in some ways \u2013 after all we\u2019ve simply swapped one \u2018S\u2019 for another \u2018S\u2019. and in terms of our acronym there\u2019s no change at all \u2013 we are still DDTS.\u00a0What is important to say is that this name change is to better represent the range of DDTS delivery as broadly as we can."

            "text": "From my perspective, it is exciting recognition that security is a separate function and profession, embedded within DDTS. I think it will help my team feel more integrated and invested in the Defra Digital and Data Strategy and all that DDTS delivers."

            "text": "A key element of staff retention is for people to feel that they belong, and that the work they do is recognised, equally, alongside other professions within our organisation. I believe that having \u2018Security\u2019 sitting alongside \u2018Digital, Data, and Technology\u2019 in our title can drive that equal sense of belonging, that sense of us all being in this together, pulling in the same direction."

            "text": "I also hope that it will enable increased visibility of the work of security teams, and support improved engagement across DDTS and the wider Defra group.\u202fIt can also act as a baseline reminder to Defra colleagues to consider security in all aspects of their work."

This stuff matters and it could be the difference between someone clicking \u2018Apply\u2019, when they see one of our job ads\u2019, or just scrolling through. I want people to know what we\u2019re about, so that they can imagine all of the possibilities that joining DDTS might offer them."
