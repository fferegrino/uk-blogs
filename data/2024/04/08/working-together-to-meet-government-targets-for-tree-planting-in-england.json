In May 2023 Marian Spain, CEO of Natural England, and Richard Stanford, CEO of the Forestry Commission, signed a joint statement on woodland creation. Initially internally focused, we now want to share this thinking more widely."

Some owners will expect their woodlands to contribute to the bottom line of their business. For others, economics and income may not be the principal reason for creating woodlands and planting trees."

This service will provide applicants with regulatory decisions and grant offers within 12 weeks of receipt where woodland creation proposals are in areas of \u2018low sensitivity\u2019 e.g. away from designated sites, deep peat, and the best and most versatile farmland. There are 3 million ha of this land. We only need around 8.5% (260,000 ha) to achieve our legally binding tree cover target, making space for woodland without having negative impacts on food security."

This may not provide the scale needed for economically viable woodland management; however, these woodlands can provide important benefits for nature and carbon storage. Many owners simply enjoy \u2018being there\u2019 and take pleasure from watching their new woodland develop, attracting a variety of insect, bird and animal species."

These forests are managed using continuous cover or irregular forest management, underpinned by a long-term vision.
