AI is not entirely new, despite what some recent headlines may lead us to think. Machine learning (a type of AI) has been used in the healthcare industry since the 1970s. Whilst a lot of commentary has focused on uses of the new ChatGPT tool, many popular services we may not think of as \u201cAI\u201d already use it in some form. This includes the algorithms behind streaming services, traffic prediction data in navigation apps and email spam filters, as well as the voice assistants in our homes and pockets.\u00a0"

Some charities are finding the writing tools helpful for fundraising materials, bid writing, speeches or drafting policies, while \u2018speech to text\u2019 tools take meeting minutes.

It is not yet sophisticated enough to give accurate legal advice, for example, and Generative AI models can confidently produce inaccurate, plagiarised, copyright infringing or biased results without any awareness that the results it has offered may be problematic.\u00a0"

AI is still in its infancy in terms of safety and potential and should be used responsibly. Some AI tools handle data in less secure ways than others, and you will need to understand this in your own circumstances.
