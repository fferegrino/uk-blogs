Working at thousands of sites on a 5-year cycle, surveyors are collecting information on soils, vegetation, and landscape change across the country. The results will allow us to make national-scale assessments on the state of these vital resources, and their ability to keep underpinning ecosystem services like food production and biodiversity.\u00a0\u00a0"

We also identify types of microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, from their DNA. We want to understand what communities (which combinations of different species) are present, and how this relates to other soil properties.
