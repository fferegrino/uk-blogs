He\u2019s now applied for funding for various pieces of equipment over the past four or so years."

            "text": "David said: \u201cI have to say that the process of applying for the grants is ridiculously easy. You don\u2019t even need to get quotes. You just pick the item you want and the Grants team say what percentage they\u2019ll put towards it as different pieces of equipment are scored at different points. All you then need to do to be paid is to show you\u2019ve bought the correct item. That\u2019s why it appeals so much to me.\u201d"

My wife and I run the farm as our son and daughter are doing other things. The business is strong and I\u2019m now looking to put a manager in while we step back a bit.\u201d"

            "text": "The farm has also received funding for Automated Footbaths and a Trailing Shoe Slurry System. \u201cAnother major problem is lameness in cows, caused by either stones or pathogens, so if you put in a footbath, you can keep consistency throughout the herd and the slurry system allows for better management as instead of spraying the slurry, it puts it directly onto the ground.\u201d"

I will apply for other grants \u2013 it\u2019s very simple, you look down the list and see what you want, but don\u2019t spend money for the sake of it.\u201d"
