Whilst much of the focus will have been on the content of the test \u2013 for example around whether some modern technologies on vehicles needs to make their way into the MOT \u2013 the call for evidence also included wider aspects of the MOT. Those wider aspects included enforcing the roles, the whole way the scheme is administered and service to motorists."

Not surprisingly, there are lots of different views \u2013 often opposing. We now need to work with the garage industry, and other stakeholders to find a path through all the feedback to make sure future changes work for everyone."

            "text": "One of the higher profile ways we have worked together is through a workshop. DFT, alongside DVSA and the Transport Research Laboratory, hosted a workshop in Birmingham in February. This allowed us to get key representatives from the industry together and talk through the main themes from the call for evidence. Those stakeholders included those associations that represent the garage industry, professional bodies for the industry, manufacturers, vehicle users and those involved in research \u2013 it really did provide many perspectives. That workshop has helped us do some very high prioritisation and work out what things might be feasible and desirable in the shorter term, and those that may take a little longer."

So, yes, we did touch on the contentious subject of fees!! Not suggesting it is all solved \u2013 but talking openly about the challenges is a key step."
