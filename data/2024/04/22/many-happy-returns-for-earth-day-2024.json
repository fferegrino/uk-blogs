Instead of recycling, the Many Happy Returns project explores reusable-packaging systems as part of a plastics circular economy. This goes beyond recycling, as we believe by keeping packaging material in circulation for as long as possible, reuse systems reduce leakage into the environment and the resultant environmental damage.\u00a0"

As well as scientists and engineers, we also have researchers from the University of Sheffield\u2019s English and Psychology Departments in the multidisciplinary team involved in the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0But what role does a linguist have in reducing plastic waste? And why are insights from psychology useful?\u00a0\u00a0"

So, we explored the language that is used by people and organisations to describe plastics and identified how language can be used as a tool to change behaviour. Psychologists used packaging that had been manipulated by mechanical engineers to help us to identify what people are willing to reuse, what factors influence these decisions, and at what point reuse becomes unacceptable for the consumer, for example when a bowl is too stained or scratched.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our chemical engineers conducted life cycle analyses to study reuse systems and identify which types of products had the most potential for reuse.\u202f Our chemists and mechanical engineers developed criteria to select the best materials for reuse systems. They answered the specific question \u2018how many times do you have to reuse to get ahead on sustainability?\u2019 The answer to this question depends on many things; the materials used, their relative weights, the collection and washing processes, and is typically between 10 and 100 uses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Together with manufacturers, designers, brand owners, retailers and policy makers, we have developed design and use guidelines for takeaway packaging based on a pilot study in the living laboratory of the University of Sheffield cafes.\u00a0"
