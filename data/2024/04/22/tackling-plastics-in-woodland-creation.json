It seems like a good time to share with you what we are doing to try to reduce plastic pollution in woodlands. We\u2019ve been supporting recycling schemes, and creating and sharing guidance in collaboration with a variety of partners on projects across England. But what are the main problems we're attempting to tackle?"

Plastic tree protection was first created back in 1979 for this purpose but since then has also been used as a protection method from being eaten by large populations of mammals such as deer, squirrels and voles.\u00a0 Tree guards as a way of protecting trees has become standard practice in forestry across the UK."

            "text": "Using plastic as a material for creating tree guards has allowed for cheap, effective, durable protection for trees over the decades. It is recommended that tree guards are removed from the trees after around 7 to 10 years. By this point the tree should be strong and tall enough to no longer need protection. However, we know that removing them during this timeframe has not often been the case over the last four decades, which has led to a problem of plastic pollution in woodlands."

Before the hazards of plastic were understood as fully as they are today, plastic tree guards were once sold as being able to be left out in the environment. We now know this is not the right thing to do and we need to action 2 main priorities."

The large boom in the population of deer over the decades has led to a significant negative impact on our woodlands and trees. We need to reduce the pressures that our trees are facing to more sustainable levels to begin to extensively phase out the need for tree protection. You can find out more about reducing the impact of deer in this blog."

Tree guards have played a vital role in this but should not be contributing to the wider environmental issue of plastic pollution. We\u2019ll continue to work hard with our partners to find sustainable ways of planting trees whilst reducing the long-term plastic impact."
