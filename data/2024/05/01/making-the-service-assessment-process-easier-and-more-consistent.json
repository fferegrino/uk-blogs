Our research findings show that the way we assess these services in DfE could be more straightforward. We found: \u2022 the assessment process was confusing at times. \u2022 some people did not understand the purpose of service assessments or that their work needed a service assessment. \u2022 teams struggled for how to best demonstrate their work at assessment. \u2022 everyone involved in an assessment struggled or faced pain points in multiple parts of the process.Some of the reasons for the problems relate to guidance being in multiple places, sometimes guidance is contradictory. Other reasons include a general lack of awareness of standards, and very manual, repetitive processes."

            "text": "We collaborated with DfE assessors and assessors from other government departments to find out how they prepare for an assessment, work with the other assessors, and complete the report. In addition to these groups of people, we also ran sessions with Heads of Profession across DfE and Deputy Directors, to help us understand what information is important to them. This helped us to develop features which not only support standard owners and leadership, but service teams to understand good practice from the outcomes of service assessments."

The service will be supported by emails sent using GOV.UK Notify, which will let teams or assessors know when they need to do the next thing, for example: \u2022 add teammates who are taking part in the assessment \u2022 add links to artefacts for assessors to read Emails will also provide links to relevant guidance that\u2019s on Apply the Service Standard in DfE, so people are getting the right content at the right time."

It\u2019s been iterated based on feedback by service teams and assessors with a wide range of experience and knowledge of the Service Standard. We included the RAG rating changes to service assessments from CDDO and incorporated them into the service and supporting guidance."

Ideally, we\u2019d have one service for all of government, but this isn\u2019t something we\u2019re set up to provide or support. Working in the open and sharing source code, however, means any other department can take the code, set it up themselves and provide the service within their own departments. We would like to work closely with a couple of departments to make this happen and learn how they use it and contribute features into the core product. Our backlog includes things like real-time editing, Slack integration, and how we can consolidate reporting around trends in Service Standard outcomes across government."
