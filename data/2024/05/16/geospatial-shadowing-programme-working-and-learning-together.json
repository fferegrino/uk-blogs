It was incredibly valuable to be able to build an understanding of which datasets they knew about (and which they were not so aware of), which they found the most useful and how they accessed them. Working in teams naturally led to some healthy competition between us, and it was a great team-building exercise which led to some strong connections being made. It is easy to make assumptions about how users will access our datasets and what information they require, but this exercise opened my eyes to the large range of data and outputs that organisations need when using BGS data and how they interpret our data.\u00a0"

A key benefit from the day was highlighting improvements which can be made to how BGS communicates the use cases of its data products. We usually write up supporting documentation in isolation per product. An exercise like this highlighted that when using multiple BGS datasets in tandem, it is useful to have more guidance on how these data products can be used in conjunction with one another.\u00a0"
