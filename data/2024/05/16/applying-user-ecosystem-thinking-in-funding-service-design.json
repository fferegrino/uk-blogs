Consideration was not given to the needs of other users in the wider scooter ecosystem, such as pedestrians and cyclists, who were getting frustrated by scooters left in the middle of the pavement. The inevitable backlash resulted in the city authorities revoking the company\u2019s licence.\u00a0 \u00a0"

This meant they introduced features to the service to meet some of these needs, such as designated parking places and the rider having to take a photo to prove they have parked responsibly. Additional security features were also introduced to reduce the risk of vandalism.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Or do those archetypes simply not exist in our ecosystem? Was that because we were trying to apply this to a complex digital service?
