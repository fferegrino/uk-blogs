They wouldn\u2019t necessarily use the service we\u2019re building, but they might represent the \u2018real\u2019 user in some way, which helps us get a sense of what they might need. We are building relationships with trusted organisations and charities to support us with this."

Screeners allow us to get all the information we need from a participant, to avoid back and forth if they aren\u2019t right for the research. We can capture farming experiences, packaging tonnages, import commodities or just about anything we will use to segment on. We then use these screeners to match the right participants to the right research projects."

Do they work in an industry where you are likely to find participants that use screen readers, or are you better going through an accessibility audit? Are you working with participants that might not self-identify as having dyslexia, and how do you deal with that situation?"

They wanted to conduct accessibility testing, but faced a challenge: finding enough participants within their target demographic. Despite sourcing and compensating participants, along with providing contextual information about the research, they realised that accessibility testing might not yield as much insight as an accessibility audit. So they opted to go through the internal accessibility team at Defra to review their service initially, before taking out an audit through an external supplier."
