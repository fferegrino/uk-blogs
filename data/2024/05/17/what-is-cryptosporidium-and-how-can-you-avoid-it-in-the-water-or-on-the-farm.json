This nasty bug lives in the intestines of infected humans and animals and is passed out in their poo. It can then spread and contaminate water sources like lakes, rivers, and swimming pools, as well as food like raw milk and vegetables."

Other groups at high risk of catching the bug include people working with farm animals or contaminated water, those changing nappies, or travelling to countries with poor sanitation. \u00a0It can cause serious illness in those of any age with weakened immune systems."

You can also get it by swallowing contaminated water while swimming or drinking untreated water. Sometimes contaminated food like unwashed vegetables or raw milk can pass on the parasite too."

It can last around 2 weeks, with the illness seeming to improve and then returning before you properly recover. The only way to know for sure if you have the illness is by getting tested by your doctor."
