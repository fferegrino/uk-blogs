I chose to research Emotional Based School Non-Attendance (EBSNA), as at the time, I had only just heard about the term, but could see we were experiencing issues with getting students through the door due to anxieties. From my research, I found that students displaying severe signs of EBSNA required patience, time, targeted intervention and sometimes an \u2018alternative\u2019 setting."

I needed to work closely with senior leaders to ensure the changes I was proposing not only reduced anxieties and improved attendance, but also improved academic outcomes and did not majorly reduce the whole school budget. This is where leadership and management became central to effective practice."

This meant I could get feedback and input from SLT on how my action plan links to other areas within the academy such as teaching and learning, curriculum, PSHE, attainment and staff CPD. I was then able to further improve my strategy and link it to the academy framework and vision."

I also felt invigorated to take on some of the bigger challenges and difficult conversations with partner agencies to get the right provision for our students."
