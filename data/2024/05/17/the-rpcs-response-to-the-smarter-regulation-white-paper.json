The RPC welcomes the White Paper and the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the quality of regulation. We look forward to working with the Government to ensure that these commitments are delivered effectively. However, there are areas where the Government could go further, in particular with efforts to strengthen the Better Regulation Framework."

            "text": "We welcome proposals to establish independent scrutiny of regulators\u2019 cost-benefit analysis (Reform 14). Under the updated Better Regulation Framework, provisions made by regulators are not in scope of the Framework and therefore do not receive RPC scrutiny. Independent scrutiny would help to improve the robustness of the regulators\u2019 analysis and provide comfort to stakeholders over its quality and effectiveness. We hope that this proposal will be taken up by many of the regulators; we will publish a list of those regulators that have agreed to independent scrutiny of their cost-benefit analysis."

        {
            "text": "We likewise welcome proposals to strengthen the Better Regulation Framework (Reform 20). For the framework to work effectively, when we issue an opinion that an assessment is not fit for purpose, or where there is no post-implementation review of existing regulation, there needs to be a clear mechanism for the Government and Parliament to take this into account in deciding whether to proceed with the policy \u2013 for example the Danish system has a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach, where their government has to justify any decision to proceed with legislation that has been red rated by their regulatory scrutiny body."

            "text": "In addition, we believe that there is more that can be done to \u2018strengthen\u2019 the Better Regulation Framework. We continue to question the exemption of building safety regulations from the Framework. We do not agree with the justification in the White Paper (footnote 33) that these regulatory provisions are somehow different because they deal with citizen\u2019s lives and wellbeing and can have tragic consequences when Government gets them wrong \u2013 the same is true of many other regulations that fall under the Better Regulation Framework. As a result of the exemption, these regulations do not receive the same, independent scrutiny of the quality of the impact, or options assessments as other Government regulatory proposals. A recent report on regulation from the Centre for Policy Studies criticises a DLUHC regulation requiring a second staircase in buildings that are more than 18m tall. They comment that DLUHC\u2019s estimate of the cost of the measure: \u201cappears to be out by an order of magnitude. Yet there is no way for anyone outside DLUHC to challenge the figures, not least because the new Better Regulation Framework exempts \u2018regulatory provisions for the safety of tenants, residents and occupants in buildings\u2019 from independent scrutiny\u201d."

        {
            "text": "We also agree with the emphasis on the importance of completing Post-Implementation Reviews (PIRs) of existing regulation before introducing new regulations. Another proposal in the White Paper (Reform 21) suggests that departments should \u201cconsider the merits of using \u2018sunset\u2019 or expiry clauses in secondary legislation to allow for the removal of regulatory provisions whose necessity and effectiveness is not confirmed by suitable monitoring and evaluation.\u201d Given that PIRs are already a statutory requirement (although a requirement that is not complied with in the majority of cases), we strongly support the initiatives to ensure that they are properly undertaken on a more comprehensive basis, and would like Government (and individual Ministers) to give greater priority to their responsibility to meet these requirements."

        {
            "text": "We welcome the Government\u2019s commitment to support our publication of data on departments\u2019 performance against the Better Regulation Framework (Reform 22). We believe that the transparency and accountability that this provides will help to strengthen adherence to and delivery of the Framework. To this end, our next blog-post will include a spreadsheet summarising the gradings and ratings of all the 140 Impact Assessments that we have reviewed over the last two years \u2013 this will allow stakeholders to compare the quality of IAs produced by different government departments. We will follow this up with publication of PIR ratings and also upcoming PIR requirements, so that it will be clear when departments miss their statutory PIR deadlines."

            "text": "As the updated Framework completes its transition period and is fully implemented across government, we hope that the Government will continue to strengthen the Framework to achieve the full benefits of an effective and comprehensive regulatory programme. We welcome the Government\u2019s efforts and ambition in the White Paper and look forward to its speedy implementation to ensure that the UK\u2019s regulatory approach remains one of the best in the world."
