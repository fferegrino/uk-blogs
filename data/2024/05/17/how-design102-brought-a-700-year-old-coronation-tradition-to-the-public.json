The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Antonia Romeo, commissioned Design102 to change this by designing and creating a website to host the Coronation Roll from the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in May 2023, and we worked closely with the Cabinet Office to deliver this. Read on to learn about the Roll, our process and the results."

The Roll contains details of the accession, the planning of the Coronation, and a description of the ceremony."

However, they also wanted more than just a long scroll of text \u2013 they were looking for interactivity and the opportunity to peek behind the curtain, discovering more about the Coronation through videos and further resources."

They both aimed to blend contemporary and traditional elements, with one focusing on vibrant colours and design while the other leaned towards a more traditional style. Our goal with both routes was to reflect how the Coronation brought together contemporary British culture and historic tradition."

Serif fonts were chosen for their traditional feel, which when paired with the striking full-bleed photography creates a timeless modern-traditional design."

The final website features the historically-accurate Coronation Roll on a single page, complemented with images to bring the text to life. Elements of the Roll are highlighted to click-through to further information in the form of videos, photography, audio clips and more. The result is a truly interactive and engaging website that preserves tradition while celebrating modernity."
