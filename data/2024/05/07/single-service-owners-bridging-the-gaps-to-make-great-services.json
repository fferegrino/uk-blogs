In today's digital age, it's essential to ensure these services not only meet but exceed the public's needs and expectations, all while being run efficiently. This goal is at the core of our Transforming for a Digital Future strategy, aiming to elevate 50 of the Top 75 government services to a 'great' standard by 2025.

            "text": "Government services often depend on a mix of digital, policy, and operational delivery specialisms, making it challenging for teams to make end-to-end improvements in usability and efficiency across all channels. After a comprehensive review in January 2023, we recognised the complexity of these services and the limitations of our current setup. This recognition was reinforced by the Public Accounts Committee's report in September, emphasising the need for a single owner with clear visibility and accountability for end-to-end delivery."

They manage multiple products across online and offline channels, ensuring services align with program and departmental objectives while meeting user needs. Single Service Owners manage budgets, staffing, procurement, and performance, oversee necessary business processes, and act as advocates for agile, outcome-based approaches. They take on a vital role in communicating the benefits and performance of their services and prioritise continuous improvement and seamless operation to minimise disruptions, ensuring their services never miss a beat."

This means engaging with teams across departments and functions to understand the likely changes. This also includes developing a training and support offer to help the new Single Service Owners thrive."

We welcome your input and involvement in shaping this new era of government service delivery. Together, we aim to elevate government services to meet the needs and expectations of the digital age in a more efficient and user-centric way.
