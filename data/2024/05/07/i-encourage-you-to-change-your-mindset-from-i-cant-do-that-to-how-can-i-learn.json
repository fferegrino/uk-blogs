Looking back, I wish I had taken advantage of the support available after graduating, and had more confidence in myself.

I was assigned to a service support team where I had the opportunity to work with developers, business analysts, and user researchers. I felt like a fish out of water at first, but my supportive colleagues were always there to guide and encourage me. I initially struggled with confidence, but my colleagues quickly helped me gain confidence to contribute to group conversations and realise the value of my ideas."

I also organised data and sent out emails for events. I enjoyed working with developers and business analysts the most as it allowed me to exercise my passion for finding and solving problems."
