Last year, Rapid Deployment teams were piloted across the country to swiftly clean up fly-tipping, vandalism and littering. The pilot was originally rolled out to Greater Manchester, Wales, the north-east and the east of England and are led by Community Payback supervisors. These pilots fulfil offenders\u2019 Unpaid Work commitments and provide a visible, tangible benefit to local communities."

In total over two hundred and fifty bags of rubbish and large items that had been fly-tipped were collected by four offenders who spent the following day at the site with a Community Payback supervisor. The rubbish was then ready for the local authority to dispose of. Local residents thanked the group for their work."

A team of three offenders were mobilised with a Community Payback supervisor, and the task was completed within twenty-five hours. In total, forty-eight bags of litter were removed from the site and 168kg of rubbish. The local authority said they were extremely happy with the work, and they had received positive responses from residents. One local resident said she was delighted that the alleyway was being cleared, and another neighbour commented that he hadn't seen it this good in fifteen years."
