A purchaser would then proceed by taking a transfer from the tenant for life (the registered proprietor) but the trustees of the settlement would join in the transfer to receive the capital monies. Admittedly, this assumes the registered proprietor (the tenant for life) remains alive. Upon the purchaser\u2019s registration, the restriction is automatically cancelled."
