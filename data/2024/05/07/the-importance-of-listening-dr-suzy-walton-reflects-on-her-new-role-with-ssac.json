            "text": "\u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed\u2026\u201d I first applied to join the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) just after my 6th child was born. I was previously a Senior Civil Servant in the Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit and worked on aspects of public services, so I saw SSAC as an extremely important part of that landscape. The time wasn\u2019t right however. Several years later, and not too long after number 7 was born, I applied again. This time I was successful and was very proud to take up my role in 2024."

            "text": "I have sat on many boards - some international, and many government committees. I honestly don\u2019t think I could name a body where I have felt that we played as important a role in the lives of so many as SSAC."

            "text": "SSAC\u2019s responsibilities range from scrutiny of secondary legislation on the welfare system, to giving informal advice to DWP and HMRC on policy issues and its own independent research. Ultimately, at a macro level the committee supports government\u2019s agenda to drive economic growth by ensuring people enter and stay in work, and supporting people where they can\u2019t. It also contributes to the important work on removing barriers for disabled people."

            "text": "For me personally there are many philosophical issues as yet unresolved \u2013 for example, to what extent should we have a welfare system that is increasingly means-tested vs. recognising that contributory benefits may also have their place?\u00a0 And I also question how far we can \u2013 or indeed should go with digitising many of the interactions between people in receipt of support and government departments. These are questions with no quick answers and questions which require considerable research and consultation. On the issue of contributory benefits \u2013 which are pinned not to savings but to whether you\u2019ve paid requisite National Insurance (NI) contributions, we are certainly \u2018out of kilter\u2019 with the OECD average. If we continue on the current trajectory, we can expect to see more conditionality attached to remaining contributory benefits and their value further eroded. There are arguments both for and against this trend. SSAC had a look at this in its independent report Jobs and Benefits: the covid-19 challenge. It\u2019s worth noting that Beveridge \u2013 in his paper which launched the post-war welfare system, judged that back then people wanted a \u2018something for something\u2019 system \u2013 i.e. benefits in return for contributions. But social attitudes change. Perhaps it\u2019s time for a national conversation on this contentious issue!"

Some of the key things I have learnt about governance are - the need to have a clear strategy, a set of objectives to delivery that strategy, and performance measures (\u2018KPIs\u2019) to be able to track progress or regress towards those objectives. It\u2019s also important to have a stakeholder management plan and risk registers. You also need to know who you are accountable to. In terms of governance, I see SSAC as having an excellent modus operandi. That said, it\u2019s my experience that there\u2019s always more an organisation can do to improve and there is every indication that SSAC (and indeed the Department for Work and Pensions) are \u2018listening\u2019 organisations that will seek to better their practices."

        {
            "text": "\u201cWho do we serve?\u201d is one of the first questions I had as a member of SSAC. As a Senior Civil Servant in the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office there were often complex answers to this question, for we served the interests of many different groups. With SSAC, it\u2019s clear, we assist the Department and also the legislative process but we actually serve the public. We try - through our scrutiny, advice and research functions - to make sure that within certain fiscal constraints, the welfare system works for people."

            "text": "One of my early roles was as producer, presenter and editor of my own travel programme \u2013 Time Off, on LBC Radio. I travelled extensively, attempting to capture cultures and customs exclusively through the medium of sound. What I learnt then was an important early lesson \u2013 to listen. I could tell you what it was like to sit on the flight deck of Concorde and take a \u2018sharp right turn\u2019 at the chequerboard set into the hills as you approach the old Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong. But it made much more sense to record the pilots talking about their experience \u2013 their own view of the challenges of landing a supersonic aircraft without bumping into a hill! So too, with SSAC, I hope we will always remember to listen to people and truly hear what they tell us about navigating a complex system."
