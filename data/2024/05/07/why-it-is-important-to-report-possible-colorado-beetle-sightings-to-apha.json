In the past 70 years there have been two outbreaks of Colorado beetles in the UK, one in 1976 and one in 1977. Both outbreaks were eradicated shortly after detection."

The adult beetles and larvae feed on the foliage of potato and several other plants in the nightshade family, and can completely strip them of their leaves if they are left uncontrolled. However, they do not pose a threat to human or animal health."
