            "text": "Visiting a farm is an enjoyable and educational experience for the whole family, but it carries a risk of infection from animals or the environment. Farm animals may carry germs that can be passed from animals to humans and cause illness, with symptoms including diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, nausea and body aches. In vulnerable groups, such as young children, pregnant women and elderly or immunocompromised people these infections can be particularly serious."

            "text": "Infection can be picked up from the animal\u2019s body, its poo or from areas where animals are kept or have recently been. If the germs are on your hands, you could accidentally pass them to your mouth and become infected. You can\u2019t see the germs, so your hands may appear clean."

            "text": "Washing your hands thoroughly with liquid soap and warm running water immediately after you have had contact with animals or the areas where they have been and at the end of your visit will reduce the risk of infection. Dry your hands; ideally, with paper towels. Hand gels or wipes are not a substitute for washing your hands after visiting a farm, due to the types of germs you might be exposed to. These germs may not cause animals to be visibly ill so it\u2019s difficult to tell whether an animal is infected, especially when they look clean and healthy."

            "text": "Anyone who has experienced sickness or diarrhoea after visiting a farm could pass the illness on to others, so they should not attend work, school or nursery until they have been free of symptoms for at least 2 days. However, with infections from some bugs, extra tests may be needed to ensure they have fully recovered and will not pass on the infection to others before starting back at work, school or nursery. People who handle food, children under 5 years and those who work closely with people who may be vulnerable to infections should discuss with their GP or local health protection team before returning to work, school or nursery."
