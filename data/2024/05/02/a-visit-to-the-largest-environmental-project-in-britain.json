The site is based in Somerset, and once completed it will house two nuclear reactors. This is the first in a new generation of nuclear power stations in the UK, which will provide zero-carbon electricity for millions of homes. Nuclear energy has a vital role to play in our energy future, and it\u2019s a form of energy that has been providing the UK with clean electricity for 60 years."

It runs on rail tracks, allowing it to be moved in different directions. Late last year, the crane was used to place a 245-tonne steel dome on top of the first of two nuclear reactors on site."
