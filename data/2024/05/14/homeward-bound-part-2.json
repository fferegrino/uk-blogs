It was a significant highlight to hear about the variety of career interests, disciplines, sectors, nationalities, and cultures that the 109 members of our cohort brought to the programme."

We spent two days together to set the foundations for our programme, to develop our code of conduct, and intentionally consider how we would work together and live together aboard the Island Sky."

While the Drake is renowned as one of the most treacherous stretches of water for ships to cross, the weather conditions we encountered were unusual as the wind was travelling directly north, which, combined with the 8metre swell, caused the ship to roll and pitch dramatically."

        {
            "text": "We were crossing the Drake Passage on our way to King George Island, in the South Shetlands, and our introduction to Antarctica. At least this was the current plan, as it had changed several times in response first to avian flu and then due to the unusual weather, and danger of further rough seas requiring us to bypass Elephant Island \u2013 the site where Shackleton\u2019s crew awaited his rescue."

        {
            "text": "Throughout our voyage, we were reminded of the need to constantly respond to changing circumstances and conditions, and to treat each change as \u2018plan A\u2019, because it was the best available choice for the day. This was one of many lessons in emergent leadership which our surroundings inspired."

A mixture of turquoise-tinged ice bergs, snow-covered islands, and rafts of porpoising penguins. Throughout the voyage, we were treated to sightings of 6 different species of penguin, humpback and fin whales, Weddell, crabby and elephant seals, and a daily entourage of albatross and petrels, cormorants and terns."

            "text": "Our days were divided between the leadership programme and excursions off ship, for example to Deception Island \u2013 an active volcano which last erupted in 1967. On shore, we climbed to the edge of the crater, and then gathered at the water\u2019s edge for our much-anticipated \u2018polar plunge\u2019, an opportunity to swim in 0.6\u00b0C water. We also visited Port Lockroy, and the \u2018Penguin Post Office\u2019."

            "text": "The programme itself covered the four streams we\u2019d been working on virtually \u2013 leadership, strategy, visibility, and STEMM. The first half of the voyage was led by our faculty members, and then we put our names in a hat, and three \u2018leaders\u2019 were selected each day to enable an emergent leadership approach. We discussed priorities for these sessions across the group, forming collaborative workshops to develop projects to continue beyond the project, and build the legacy of our journey \u2013 and we continue to work on these priorities together now we\u2019re home."

The expedition crew included several polar researchers who, over recent decades, have witnessed the changes that are occurring and could point out how unusual some of our experiences were \u2013 including experiencing rain on one of our outings, signalling much milder temperatures than would usually be expected at that time of year."

            "text": "Antarctica is a remarkable demonstration of international collaboration, science and peace, and there is much that we can learn from it. It was an immense privilege to witness its beauty, and to understand its vital and fragile role in supporting life around the world. For all of us on our return, the challenge is how we share this experience and continue to work together to help secure our future."
