This meant that getting meaningful insights to help inform decisions and future opportunities was challenging. The get approval to spend service changes that and supports the whole version 6 digital and technology spend controls process. It captures spend cases in a standard way, automatically builds out a pipeline of activity for organisations and enables much improved tracking of case conditions. It will unlock standardisation and will deliver greatly enhanced insights.\u00a0"

            "text": "Previous versions of the digital and technology spend approvals process followed an approach which assessed all spend cases in a similar way, regardless of the risk and importance of the case. The risk and importance framework ensures that high-risk and high-value cases get the attention they require, whilst making the approval process for low risk and low value cases more efficient for organisations. The risk and importance framework is built into the get approval to spend service, so when a user uploads a spend case, they answer a series of questions to be provided with an automated risk rating. This means all cases get a baseline assessment to work from, making it easier to determine how cases get assured.\u00a0"

This means that organisations can progress low and medium risk spend activity much more quickly. Not only does this empower organisations to strive for and develop internal maturity, but it also enables CDDO to focus and conduct more in-depth assurance on high-risk and high-value cases."
