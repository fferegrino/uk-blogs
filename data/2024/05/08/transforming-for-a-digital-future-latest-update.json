On average, every 15 seconds of every working day since the initiative launched, one civil servant signed-up to learn about data. The Government Digital and Data profession has also continued to grow and is now at 5.4% of the total Civil Service workforce, close to our target of 6%.\u00a0"

The PNC underpins essential day-to-day operational policing but it is a complex, legacy IT system that requires updating. The new LEDS is being developed using a product-centric approach that will result in a more efficient and user-friendly service for law enforcement officials."

The vision is \u2018Data Confidence\u2019 to ensure all staff are enabled to use data effectively and appropriately to enhance decision making, drive efficiencies and unlock innovation. The strategy will also deliver the right data culture and foundations to safely and securely approach the use of advanced capabilities like AI. All teams are being asked to contribute, with a people-first approach to delivery, including through strong data leadership, strengthening data literacy training and sharing expertise."
