            "text": "It's a bit of a mix for me. There's something eternal in my view about the idea of public service, and that's what's caused so many of us to come and want to be civil servants. Although it was a long while ago for me, that fire burns as strongly in me to be a proud civil servant. But we have to recognise that the demands on us, and the way the world is changing, is creating new expectations of us. For me, a modern civil service means meeting those expectations, but not losing that public service ethos that is an eternal verity in my view.\u00a0"

It was effectively a job that I wasn't expecting to stay in, but instead I absolutely loved it. And when I said, \u201ccould I apply to be a permanent civil servant?\u201d they said, yes, of course.\u00a0 So I applied, worked my way up through various of the grades, starting in operational delivery. I loved meeting the public and working with the public. It was just eye opening as a young man, and I just loved that sense of what we did was really important.\u00a0"

Some of my career highlights involved working as a district manager for the benefits agency. I was Alastair Darling's principal private secretary for a couple of years. I ran Jobcentre Plus, and I ran all the welfare reforms as well after the coalition government came in. But my biggest job has been as senior responsible owner for Universal Credit for the last 10 years and overseeing its transformation."

If you've ever worked delivering services to the public, you have to be pretty determined to make things happen, your commitment to colleagues, and accept that you can't do this on your own. I found that determination rather infectious."

I can tell you from my inbox there are many people who are not yet happy with the way in which we're delivering services, but that doesn't make me down. That inspires me to want to improve and want to fix whatever the problem is. If it's systemic, I want to make sure it doesn't happen for other people.\u00a0"

So I'm very proud of that, because it's taken many hundreds of people over the last 10 years to build this."

We\u2019ve moved about 300,000 of those in the last six months and we're on track to do about a million of those by the end of 2024 and into 2025. So that's the next phase of the project. We've got one more phase afterwards that will see nearly 7 million people in the service some time in the future. When I took over back in 2014, I think we had about 20,000 people on Universal Credit, so you can see how it's grown.\u00a0"

As good as guidance can be, we follow a rules based system as well, as well as focusing on what the public's looking for, and I think what fires up our people \u2014 the ability to make a difference.

They don't want to be told that the computer says no. We know that in our own private lives as well, if we're ever ringing up trying to get something sorted, a gas bill or something, and somebody can't help you, that's really frustrating. So I'd want to empower people much more, and I think that is the key to quality public service.\u00a0"

I'm proud of my colleagues across the civil service, from those in the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office who are helping people on the ground, in various parts of the world, to what the MOD do every day, and I've already praised my colleagues in the Home Office and HMRC. Wherever you go in the Civil Service, people are doing a really good job for the right reasons, with the right motivations. I think the UK is blessed that there's a public service here that cares enough to want to do some of that.\u00a0"
