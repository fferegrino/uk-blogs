The Environmental Services Association have estimated that illegal waste activity costs our economy over \u00a31 billion annually which is money being taken away from other essential services.\u00a0 Those people committing waste crimes not only cost our economy a huge amount of money, their actions also negatively impact our health and spoil our environment \u2013 places we should be able to enjoy."

This operation has been ongoing since 2015 into a series of break-ins into yards and buildings and on to land throughout the south-east of England. Once they have gained access, the criminals involved unlawfully deposit large quantities of waste.\u00a0 The scale of the offending is significant and is estimated to have cost its victims over \u00a330 million to date.\u00a0These costs are being met by landowners, businesses or local councils to clear up the devastation being left behind."

            "text": "Over recent years we have seen more organised criminals working within the waste industry.\u00a0 With this becomes more sophistication in the way they work.
