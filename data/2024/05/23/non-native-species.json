These are split into \u2018widely spread\u2019 species, such as grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis and floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides; and \u2018non-widely spread\u2019 species such as raccoon Procyon lotor and tree of heaven Ailanthus altissima.

            "text": "Horticultural escapes (accidental spreading of plants into the wild, usually from domestic properties/botanical gardens for example) are one of the major pathways of entry of INNS that we deal with in the team. During a regular week, we visit garden centres and aquatic stores to inspect for listed species. We often find mislabelling of plants (or no labels at all), and one of our biggest repeat offenders is curly waterweed Lagarosiphon major being sold simply as \u2018oxygenating plant\u2019, but when established can cause severe problems for native UK plants, wildlife and the environment! An important part of our role is education, and we talk to retailers about non-native species legislation and their responsibilities. In future I would like to see guidance on plant labels highlighting invasive plants and how to manage them. We also check for contamination of plants, especially Azolla in aquatic pond plant tanks. Azolla is very invasive, creating \u2018carpets\u2019 of green across waterbodies where it is present and can be dangerous for unsuspecting animals (and people!)."

I have been lucky enough to spend some sunny summer days in the lake district, speaking with members of the public about invasive species as well as looking over their boats and boards for any contamination present. Check, Clean, Dry is a campaign run by our colleagues in the Non-Native Species Secretariat, reminding water users to clean and dry equipment in between uses to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic species between waterbodies. I have also helped run washdown stations (areas where canoes and kit can be cleaned) for participants at national canoeing events with The Wildlife Trusts and PaddleUK. Working with like-minded people and spreading the word about biosecurity is very enjoyable, especially when the sun is shining!"

            "text": "Unfortunately, at one of these events, I was reminded of the importance of washdown stations, as I found two demon shrimp Dikerogammarus haemobaphes on a canoe. These invasive shrimp prey on fish, their eggs, and other native animals and can hugely affect freshwater ecology. They are already present in the UK in some freshwater habitats, but it is vital to stop them from spreading further."

Our aim is to understand the level of contamination that containers and shipments can bring. Some of our team members have found non-native ant species, seeds, and even a dead lizard in containers across the UK. We hope that our presence at the border and our continuing container inspections will reduce the likelihood that INNS will establish in the country from this pathway."

We also determine whether enclosures for these animals are suitable (do they prevent escape, are they fit for purpose and so on) and ensure that listed animals are not used for members of the public to meet at \u2018animal encounters\u2019 or any extra commercial purpose. This is important to ensure the public understands the risks these animals pose and that there are no unnecessary movements of animals which could cause issues."

It also promotes ways we can all help pollinators through plant choices in our gardens and window boxes."

Another few weeks\u2019 population monitoring for the invasive greater white toothed shrew? Who knows..."
