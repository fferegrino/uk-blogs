We started scoping the work in Autumn 2023 as we looked at the intended outcomes, who and what we\u2019d need to build it, and what the longer term plan would be.\u00a0"

We considered what kind of content we\u2019d need, who our audience would be and what their needs would be. We created a number of prototypes as a minimum viable product and tested them with civil servants before zeroing on the hub as a solution."

Its aim is to educate and inspire civil servants to upskill themselves and come up with new and better ways of working. By sharing stories from leaders and colleagues across-government, we hope that it\u2019ll remind colleagues to take pride in the fantastic work they do in delivering the best service possible for the public.\u00a0"

Whether that\u2019s by improving interoperability between departments, upskilling yourself via Government Campus or collaborating with other teams on projects; our aim is to support you through that change."

We are trying to influence positive change, and that\u2019s only achievable if we explain things simply."

Throughout the build process we continually engaged with key stakeholders, sharing with them the most up-to-date builds and content on a regular basis. We worked with internal communications leads to make sure we had the most accurate data, figures and wording so we present a cohesive, coherent message in case studies we referenced from different departments.
