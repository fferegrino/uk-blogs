This can range from: making sure the aircraft are fit and ready for flight through servicing, and conducting see offs and see ins to send the jets off, general maintenance such as ejection seat swaps or fuel tank installations/removals, or even weapon loads."

There\u2019s plenty of welfare facilities here such as the caf\u00e9 where you can go with your mates for a brew, cake and a game of monopoly, there\u2019s a bowling alley and cinema, a library to rent out Xbox games and DVDs for film nights back in the block. There\u2019s also plenty of opportunities to get out and about to see the islands with bimble wagons or heli bids. All in all, the Falklands is a really enjoyable place to come down to and there\u2019s a lot of provisions to help pass the time during your tour."

There is always someone who knows a different way to get the job done and as such there is a lot of scope for learning. Moreover, I find working alongside weapons systems and ejection seats very interesting!"

I have loved every minute I\u2019ve spent down here and I\u2019m already looking forward to my next trip down (hopefully with 1435 Flt again). There hasn\u2019t been a dull moment during my tour and even on the days where you are feeling homesick there\u2019s plenty of other people who will get you out of your room to go out and do something to keep you occupied. Everywhere you go people always say it\u2019s the people you work with that make it what it is and that\u2019s true for the Falklands too, everyone you work with becomes your family while you\u2019re here and you all help each other out as much as you can."

It is without a doubt one of the most interesting places you can be deployed to, especially with the vast array of wildlife down here! I was hesitant and nervous to come but I\u2019m so glad I did come down, I have loved every single minute and can\u2019t wait to come back down again!"
