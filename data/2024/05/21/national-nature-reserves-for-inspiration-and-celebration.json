            "text": "I have the great pleasure of leading Natural England\u2019s work to ensure that National Nature Reserves can be experienced and enjoyed by as many people as possible. Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood NNR is a shining example of this, serving diverse communities around Leicester and beyond, enabling them to connect with and be inspired by nature and to reap all of the health and wellbeing benefits that can bring."

            "text": "I have a personal and deep-seated attachment to National Nature Reserves having grown up a stone\u2019s throw from Ainsdale Sand Dunes NNR on the Merseyside coast, an amazing reserve that I went on to have the privilege of managing for a number of years. Having been inspired myself by NNRs into a lifetime career in conservation, I\u2019m keen to see everyone having the opportunity to share in the incredible experiences that NNRs have to offer."

            "text": "The concept of a National Nature Reserves Week was born two years ago following the success of our Festival of NNRs in 2022. Natural England, working together with our NNR partnership, has a strong desire to deliver more on the ambition to connect people with nature, and this year\u2019s NNR Week has shaped up to do this through a fantastic programme of events and engagement activities right across the country."

        {
            "text": "NNR Week runs through to 31st May, and our theme for this year is \u2018National Nature Reserves for everyone\u2019. Our aim is to make NNR Week more inclusive by providing a greater range of opportunities for people to connect with nature in different and surprising ways, and in turn for those connections to hopefully inspire deeper connection still, as well as positive action for nature."
        },
        {
            "text": "The programme of over 100 events on offer this year is as diverse as the sites themselves. You can \u2018Meet the Machines\u2019 at Wyre Forest NNR in Worcestershire, or \u2018Discover Stone Age Life\u2019 at Bradgate Park; there\u2019s a Women\u2019s Photography Workshop at RSPB\u2019s Ham Wall reserve in the Somerset Wetlands NNR, and \u2018A Trip to the Movies\u2019 at Chobham Common NNR in Surrey; or how about a \u2018Rainforest Discovery Day\u2019 at East Dartmoor Woods and Heaths, or \u2018Breathwork in the Forest\u2019 at Hatfield Forest NNR in Essex?"

            "text": "Being creative with the events we offer to the public, to enable people to connect with nature in different ways and through different lenses, is an essential way for our NNRs to reach out beyond our traditional audiences and inspire more people to seek the benefits of nature and to get involved."

            "text": "Many reserves are also working closely with a range of fantastic local community partners, such as B:friend Doncaster to provide nature connection experiences for people living with loneliness and social isolation, and Mablethorpe\u2019s Men in Sheds who will be helping to build bird boxes for the Lincolnshire Coronation Coast NNR."

            "text": "The eagle-eyed reader will have spotted that NNR Week runs for much more than a week! That\u2019s because we\u2019re being greedy. We\u2019re being greedy because I believe that National Nature Reserves deserve to be celebrated for the inspiration that they offer, and that the public deserve as much opportunity as possible to experience the joy and wonder and excitement of connecting with NNRs."
