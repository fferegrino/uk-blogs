From April to August, it\u2019s fairly common to see these discoloured, sometimes creamy-looking and bad smelling foamy patches in the sea. You might think this is caused by\u00a0\u00a0 sewage or other pollution in the water, but actually this is one of our most interesting coastal phenomena and in most cases is a natural occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

During it\u2019s bloom it can form extensive colonies that resemble frog spawn, which might also be mistaken for pollutants like oil. However, as these blooms die off, they break down into a creamy-brown foam. While this might not be the most\u00a0 pleasing sight, it\u2019s a natural and and essential part of coastal ecological processes.\u00a0"
