It did continuity really well because we're in the military. And what do we do well? We pick things up in a crisis. We work really well at doing things. What we didn't do was get things ready. We didn't talk about them. We didn't prepare in order to ensure that we were ready for the next crisis."

            "text": "Dee: The diversity of thought and trying to go against group-think is absolutely important. And it's something that we drive for. The diversity that's in UKStratCom, I think is what shines. And on a day-to-day basis I can be doing one thing in the morning and doing another thing in the afternoon. Diversity is bringing the ideas to the table, but inclusion is having a voice at that table. So, that's what we do. And I think certainly in my role, I try and bring that out by working with all the various stakeholders."
