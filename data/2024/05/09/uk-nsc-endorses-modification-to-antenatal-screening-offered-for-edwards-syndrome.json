Evidence does not support the case for screening for this condition, which causes the blood vessels to tear during birth and has serious consequences for mother and baby. However, the committee agreed to write to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to ask it to revisit its clinical guidelines for vasa praevia and consider auditing activity."
