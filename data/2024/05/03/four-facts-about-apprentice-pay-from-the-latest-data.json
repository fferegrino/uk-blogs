            "text": "Ever since the National Minimum Wage was introduced in 1999, apprentices have been treated differently. At first, many apprentices were exempt from the minimum wage. In 2010, a separate \u2018Apprentice Rate\u2019 was brought in, set lower than other rates (initially at just \u00a32.50 per hour). The Apprentice Rate is the minimum hourly rate an employer can pay their apprentice if they are aged 16-18 or in the first year of their apprenticeship if older[1]."

In April 2024, the Apprentice Rate increased to \u00a36.40. In our recent advice to the Government on the future of the minimum wage, we looked in depth at the case for going further than this, and ending the different treatment of apprentices altogether."

For much of our work on the NMW, we use pay data from a survey of employers, the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings ( ASHE). We think this is less reliable for apprentices than for other workers \u2013 and prefer to use it alongside specific surveys of apprentices. The latest of these is the Apprenticeship Evaluation Survey (AEvS), carried out by the Department for Education (DfE) in 2023."

We\u2019ve published our analysis of that pay data \u2013 but in the middle of a report that\u2019s crowded with other analysis. This blog picks out the headlines on apprentice pay from the 2023 AEvS and 2023 ASHE. Our analysis may differ from what is published by DfE because we focus on apprentices eligible for the Apprentice Rate; see our report on the Minimum Wage Beyond 2024 [link] for more details."

As a share of coverage, underpayment sits well above 60 per cent for some age groups. Around half of the underpaid apprentices receive wages within 5 per cent of the Apprentice Rate."
