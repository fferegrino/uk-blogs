As I\u2019ve said many times, charity campaigning plays an important role in society and the law is clear about the right of charities to campaign in support of their purposes. The Commission is steadfast about that."

Complaints to the regulator are one certainty in an otherwise uncertain period of heightened political volatility. But in regulating charities in line with the legal framework I assure you that - whilst all complaints will be considered carefully - I will not allow the Commission to be misused or weaponised by\u00a0any particular side of the public debate, whether it be by politicians, the media, or indeed the sector itself."
