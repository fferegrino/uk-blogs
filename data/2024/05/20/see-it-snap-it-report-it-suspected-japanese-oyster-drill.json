            "text": "This species potential sighting caused considerable concern as it preys on oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, cockles, barnacles and other gastropods, by drilling through their shells and consuming their flesh. If this species were to establish, it could put economically and environmentally significant species at risk, such as the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis). To avoid these potentially detrimental impacts, an emergency response was triggered."

Information was gathered to create a briefing document for all involved.\u00a0 This included consulting suitable experts regarding the identification of the egg cases, from photographs submitted, and collating a brief overview of the species.\u00a0 Next step was to arrange a survey of the beach where the sample had been spotted, to check for additional evidence or samples."

This would ensure relevant individuals and organisations knew about the species and how to report any possible sightings."
