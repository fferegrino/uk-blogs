Feedback from community meetings has been really positive with one service user saying the room \u201cgives a positive and relaxing energy\u201d and another remarking how they find it \u201cstunning and helps us to stay chilled.\u201d"

It is refreshing to see how quickly the hubs are growing and the amazing feedback we are getting from patients and colleagues."

What's more, they feel fully invested in their creation. In this way, the hubs are helping to create a sense of self, connectedness and, ultimately, recovery. They also provide reassurance to families when seeing this space, knowing their loved ones are not in an institution, but a place they played a part in creating."

Staff, including managers, are over the moon too. We all feel invested in these spaces and are excited to see how they will make a positive difference, from enhancing engagement on evenings and weekends, to having a place where service users can relax and socialise."
