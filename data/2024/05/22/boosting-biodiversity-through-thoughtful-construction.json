The theme of this years\u2019 International Day for Biodiversity is, \u2018Be Part of the Plan\u2019, a global call to action for all stakeholders to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity. To celebrate, we are sharing our biodiversity plans for the transformation of the Defra Animal and Plant Health Agency\u2019s (APHA) Weybridge science campus."
