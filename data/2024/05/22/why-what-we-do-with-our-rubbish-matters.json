I joined because I want to play my part in protecting our environment for people to enjoy now and in the future. It\u2019s really important to use our natural resources wisely and reduce our impact on the environment as much as possible."

We work with Defra and Government to design effective regulatory frameworks to protect our environment which includes rules around moving and disposing of waste. The Environment Agency oversees these regulations, providing advice and guidance to individuals and businesses to ensure they understand what is expected of them. We have teams of officers across the country who work everyday to check businesses are operating within the limits of their environmental permits."

            "text": "We also have dedicated enforcement teams who work hard to stamp out crime within the waste sector. Sadly, crime is rife, but we are determined to disrupt and stop criminals and bring them to justice using our regulatory powers. In the most serious cases we can take offenders through the courts; the courts set the punishment outcome."

Find one on the register and ask them where they are taking your waste as it will need to end up at a site with an environmental permit or exemption."
