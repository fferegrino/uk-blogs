These schemes deliver enhancements for nature while delivering flood protection for people and businesses. For example, we have recently partnered with the Wild Trout Trust and others on the River Witham at Manthorpe, Lincolnshire to reconnect the floodplain allowing the river to change and evolve, creating new habitats for wildlife. We have also worked with the Ullswater Catchment\u202fRestoration project in Cumbria, which seeks to reverse the decline in habitat and natural processes,\u202fby working with local landowners and communities.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0"

Aside from protecting the intrinsic natural beauty of peatland landscapes, this work represents value for money. Peatland filters water, meaning water companies can use less chemical treatment; it provides habitats for rare and declining species, and it helps store carbon to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\u00a0\u00a0"

These are especially crucial in conserving and enhancing biodiversity and show that working with others significantly increases the scale of our outcomes for nature, while also delivering other multiple benefits for society. Our role in delivery of Defra\u2019s landscape recovery scheme will also help to demonstrate how collaborative working, and blending of public and private finance, can drive changes to land management and use to support ecosystem recovery and deliver multiple outcomes for nature and people.\u202f \u202f\u00a0\u00a0"

We are also delivering a wide range of projects which help deliver the government aims to have 75% of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI\u2019s) in favourable condition by 2042.\u202fYou can find out more about our work and how we are contributing to the delivery of the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP) goals here.\u00a0\u00a0"

This means a development will result in more or better quality natural habitat than there was before development. As a developer, this offers us at the Environment Agency another great opportunity to deliver more for nature recovery, especially through our Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management capital programme\u00a0 and through our role in Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs). As an organisation, we will focus on the opportunities provided by BNG to protect and enhance the water environment, including river and wetland habitats, whilst supporting wider environmental improvements within our remit.\u00a0"

This summer we are partnering with Ocean and Coastal Futures to run the ReMeMaRe conference on restoring estuarine and coastal habitats. By 2043 ReMeMaRe aims to restore at least 15% of the three priority habitats - seagrass meadows, saltmarshes and native oyster beds and reefs.\u202f By re-establishing these precious estuarine and coastal ecosystems, we are enhancing society's connection to the natural world.

We know, however, that there is much more to do to halt and reverse the decline in biodiversity, which is so essential to our heath and underpins our economy. We will be striving to play our full part in that national mission, and we call on all those who have a role in nature to join us and apply for the funding or schemes we manage, that I have mentioned above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
