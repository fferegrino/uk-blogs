The carbon calculator estimates that if I had used my personal petrol vehicle the CO2 impact of my travel would have been 23kgs of CO2. The more sustainable option of a train journey for the distance I travelled would still have released 6kgs of CO2. The UK\u2019s greenhouse gas conversion factors show my ferry and scooter journeys together were both responsible for far less than 1 kg of CO2."
