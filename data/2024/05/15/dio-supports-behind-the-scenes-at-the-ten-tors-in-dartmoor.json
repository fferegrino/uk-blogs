Over 1,000 enablers make the event happen and help to host around 9,000 participants and supporters who visit Okehampton Camp during the course of the weekend. It\u2019s a real team effort and DIO\u2019s role is to provide the facilities and specialist advice that allows the event to happen."

Given that the military have been training on Dartmoor for over 140 years there is surprisingly little military debris out there but with 2,800 youngsters walking on the moor something comes up most years."

When our ranges are live, we ensure that the public don\u2019t access them - people and bullets don\u2019t mix well. The rest of the time the majority of the training area is fully open to the public: our main role during these times is to react to any reports of military debris including swiftly \u2018making safe\u2019 anything hazardous."
