            "text": "Nature-based solutions can help us to tackle climate change in ways that also bring multiple other benefits for people and biodiversity, but realising this potential requires a wide range of different people and skillsets. Nature Returns demonstrates the power of collaborative working, bringing together scientists, land managers, green finance experts and local communities."

            "text": "We are learning lessons that will help policymakers, land managers and investors to make better decisions going forward. Some of these lessons are scientific in nature \u2013 we are quantifying how much carbon builds up in grasslands over time and how much variation there is between different locations."
        },
        {
            "text": "We are also understanding better how carbon is stored in diverse, semi-natural woodlands: old trees store disproportionately more carbon than young trees and similar amounts of carbon are found in the top 30cm of soil as in the trees themselves."
        },
        {
            "text": "But just as important are the practical lessons we are learning about how local land managers can be supported best by public bodies as they adjust to the new challenges that nature recovery and net zero present."

        {
            "text": "One challenge that we need to work on together is how to manage the consequences of extreme weather events \u2013 an increasingly frequent problem with climate change. Even in the relatively short time that Nature Returns has been running, our local partners have had to contend both with a dry spring that made it hard to establish new trees and grasslands and flooding which made it impossible to get machinery onto land over a period of several months."

        {
            "text": "Land managers can adapt and respond, but public financial rules can make it difficult for them to do so. We are also learning more about the the challenges associated with private finance and the factors that facilitate this, including the importance of confidence and trust, facilitation and leadership."

        {
            "text": "Looking ahead the programme is continuing in its present form for at least another year and local partnerships have financial support to maintain the newly created habitats for the next ten years. This will enable scientists to come back and monitor how carbon and biodiversity change over time."
