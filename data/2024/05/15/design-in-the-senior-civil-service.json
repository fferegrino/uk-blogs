My last role before joining the Civil Service was as Digital Content Manager at Wellcome Collection; a huge part of this role was moving from a web publishing model to a content design-led model. I remember actively using the Service Manual to inform our approach to content (which luckily our Product Manager was fully in support of)."

            "text": "At DBT, I earned my Civil Service content design chops by working on content design for products and services in the lead-up to Brexit. It was not easy at all \u2013 with changing policy direction, designing content that helps users \u2018do\u2019 things was very challenging. And at first, I struggled to connect with where I could add value to users because we were supporting businesses. Working on great.gov.uk helped me make that connection \u2013 many of these businesses were small to medium sized businesses who wanted to export their products but didn\u2019t know how to navigate them. But if we could increase their confidence \u2013 and help them build their capability \u2013 we could not only help them with their business, but bring more revenue into the UK, which in turn funds more public services. This was a lightbulb moment for me. I would find later my experience gained here designing in an ambiguous policy environment was very valuable to other departments \u2013 and not something I\u2019d previously done outside government."

Part of my role as a Head of Profession was to build capability for design. I remember looking at the progression frameworks for design and being struck that to move up beyond Grade 6, the most options seemed to be in Product or Delivery \u2013 with Content Design it was up and then out to the world of contracting.\u00a0"

I decided to look for opportunities at the Head level to show how I could deliver UCD at scale. When a secondment to the HM Courts & Tribunals Service as Head of User Centred Design came up, with accountability for two delivery streams and supplier management, I jumped at the chance. This role also gave me the stretch of having accountability across all design disciplines."

There was potential, though it wasn\u2019t exactly what I imagined SCS design leadership looking like \u2013 a heavier focus on design through the lens of business analysis and process design rather than UCD. It made me realise that at SCS level, the word \u2018design\u2019 is often used in its more traditional dictionary definition \u2013 for example, \u2018a plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is made\u2019.\u00a0"
