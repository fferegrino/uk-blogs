            "text": "Riley was admitted that afternoon, and at first it was thought he had bronchiolitis. Pretty quickly, the doctors suspected pertussis (whooping cough) and began treating him for it. On the 4th day of his hospital stay, he was taken to pediatrics intensive care unit (PCIU) with pneumonia."

While I knew the PICU was the best place for him, I couldn\u2019t ignore the anxious faces of the other parents who walked past Riley\u2019s room, or the draw that said \u201cbaptism gowns\u201d. It was a stark reminder that not every child who enters intensive care, leaves."

They also described the plasma exchange he would possibly need later that afternoon, where his blood would be manually removed by a syringe and replaced with a donation of plasma \u2013 a procedure that would take hours."

This was starting to feel so serious, the doctors who originally were fairly positive now looked worried and concerned. We called up Greg\u2019s Mum who lived in Adelaide, and asked her to fly to Perth that evening, as things weren\u2019t looking all that good"

She kindly \u2013 if there is a kind way \u2013 told us that we needed to prepare ourselves for the fact that Riley could die. I felt shocked and sickened. I think this is one of the first times I cried in hospital; I had been so positive that Riley would get better. Greg and I gripped each other\u2019s hands and tried to comfort each other, but really there is no way to comfort in this situation. We spent the next hour or two pacing the corridors as we waited for them to administer a new cannula, before we were allowed in."

We made the decision for me to go to my parents\u2019 house for a sleep, since I had been in hospital for four days with hardly any sleep. We thought we were going to be in it for the long haul, and that I would need my energy. As I left, I know they were preparing him for life support and the plasma transfusion. I just have no memory of looking into his eyes for the last time, or letting him know I loved him. I really hope I did."

He was screaming and screaming as they got him ready for life support, I don\u2019t know all the fine details, but I know he hadn\u2019t had any milk in a long time, and that he would have been in a lot of pain from the needles and cannulas they were administering. Greg\u2019s last memory of Riley conscious is of him screaming and distraught. That\u2019s how my baby will last remember the world."

I extracted myself from my daughter\u2019s cuddle and asked Mum to drive me to the hospital. We were there within 15 minutes but I got lost trying to find his room and was in a panic. I was greeted by a social worker and as lovely as she was, it was clearly a sign that Riley\u2019s chances had diminished."

Our parents were also there, and supported us as we were told that while they weren\u2019t giving up hope or stopping treatment, it was not looking like Riley was going to survive. His heart was failing, his lungs were filled with thick mucus, as the toxins from the pertussis and the subsequent pneumonia had ravaged his body."

We mentioned that when it was time for him to go, we\u2019d like to be holding and cuddling him, not have him lying alone on the bed. The rest of the morning was spent crying, texting family and friends about what was happening, spending time with Riley, and asking my brother to bring in our three year old daughter so she could say goodbye."

But in my case, I wasn\u2019t even informed by my health care providers about the option of pregnancy vaccination for whooping cough."

That\u2019s millions of parents each year, who watch their children die from something that could have been easily prevented \u2013 if only they had access to vaccination.\u00a0And that is not OK with me."

I guess this is just us trying to do our bit. I feel like we failed to protect him, but if we can protect other children then perhaps some good has come out of something so awful."
