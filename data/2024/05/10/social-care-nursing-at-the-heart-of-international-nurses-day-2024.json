We operate across a much wider range of settings and offer a broad yet person-focused skill set, unmatched by other health and care disciplines. Recognition of this important truth is growing."

It\u2019s a powerful concept when you consider our role in supporting others to remain physically, mentally and economically active. It also helps prove the lie we only care for older people or those with the most complex needs."
