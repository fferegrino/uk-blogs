In 2022 to 2023, 1689te of metallic waste was treated, 98% of that waste was released for recycling and diverted from the Repository..."

When LLW Repository Ltd was set up, part of the mission was to look after the capacity of the engineered vaults where low level radioactive waste is safely, and permanently disposed. We\u2019ve achieved this, and much more."

In 2008, a suite of waste treatment services and alternative disposal methods, which were more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost efficient, were introduced. In parallel, the National Waste Programme was launched to coordinate the initiative (now superseded by the Integrated Waste Management Programme)."

            "text": "This work, fuelled by innovation, collaboration across the NDA group and industry, and the use of new technologies, means that the UK\u2019s Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) in Cumbria won\u2019t reach capacity as quickly, saving nearly \u00a3870m of taxpayer money and supporting the circular economy by recycling waste. This is due to waste being diverted away from the Repository and its engineered disposal vaults with the introduction of the treatment services and alternative disposal methods."

            "text": "The UK creates a wide range of hazardous wastes generated by the nuclear industry, ranging from Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW), for example lightly contaminated rubble, all the way up to Higher Activity Waste (HAW), that originates from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. All of this hazardous waste needs to be managed safely and securely, both now and for the future. More than 90% of the UK\u2019s radioactive waste is Low Level Waste, so our services to safely manage and dispose of this waste are of vital, national importance, as we work to clean up the UK\u2019s nuclear legacy."

We now only dispose of around 2% of low-level waste into the vaults, which is an excellent step forward. We used to dispose of around 95% of the waste we managed into the vaults, so they would have filled up in a very short space of time."

This waste \u00a0doesn\u2019t need the engineered controls we have at the Repository site, and it doesn\u2019t need any treatment. The waste can just go to normal landfill sites that are permitted by the Environment Agency (EA) to accept it. This is the largest amount of waste we generate as a nuclear industry. It\u2019s all waste that can\u2019t be recycled and isn\u2019t combustible."

            "text": "Next, we can burn some of the waste in specialised incinerators. The resulting ashes can go to landfill, equating to 100% diversion from the vault. The incineration not only destroys the hazardous nature of waste but reduces the waste volume.\u00a0 Materials like rubber, plastic, oils, solvents, chemicals, wood, and contaminated PPE can all go in the incinerator."

        {
            "text": "Another of our treatments is super-compaction, which is a volume reduction technique. This sees drums of waste being literally squashed and compacted into small pucks meaning we can place a lot more waste into a container, a highly effective space-saving treatment method."

        {
            "text": "The final service is the most environmentally friendly and sustainable process - metallic treatment. We are now utilising this method as much as possible. \u00a0We work with our suppliers who use a range of special technologies to clear the radioactivity off a range of metals that can be reused and recycled. We separate the radioactivity, and that small amount of contaminated material then goes to landfill or comes back to the vault in a much smaller volume."

        {
            "text": "The waste will only head to the vaults if it can\u2019t follow one of these routes, if the radioactivity levels are too high or it just can\u2019t be treated. \u00a0Our services line of business is making a huge difference to decommissioning work. Whilst safety is always our number one priority in everything we do, as we move forward our work is becoming more efficient, more sustainable and is saving money through innovations."
