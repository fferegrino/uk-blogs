Part of this work has been to plan for a prospective National Nature Reserve in West Yorkshire so as part of our planning and research we asked more than two thousand people for their \u201ctop three\u201d reasons for visiting a green space. More than half named benefits to physical and mental health."

            "text": "We have worked with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust to help train staff to use 5 pathways to nature: contact, emotion, beauty, meaning and compassion so that they can make use of nature with patients, even when going outside is not an option. Flash cards have been used to great effect to help patients make more informed decisions about taking part in Nature Therapy. These cards show a range of activities such as gardening and walking in nature. On the back of each card is information on what those activities involves \u2013 who you do them with, what benefits they can bring you (relaxation, a new skill, etc.).\u00a0 To make it even more interactive there is an interest checklist which can be ticked off by the patient. This also provides a record of activities and how helpful they have been that can be reflected on by both staff and patients."

On one site alone, 260 trees are being planted, courtesy of the NHS Forest, to create a thriving natural space for patients, visitors and staff, with environmental benefits such as heat spot and air pollution reduction. Already we are seeing staff, patients and visitors coming up with new uses and activities for these spaces, such as herb gardening."

We have pockets of green therapy across our hospital and community services, but we want to test the benefits of connecting patients with nature as part of their care plans. We know from smaller projects that patients feel calmer when they\u2019re involved in nature-based activities, and their feedback is overwhelmingly positive.\u201d"

            "text": "As part of this project, we have even been able to bring nature \u2018inside\u2019 for our patients to help them recover. Using innovative virtual reality, we have run sessions which provide a \u2018nature experience\u2019 from within hospital wards. This involved putting on a headset and having a choice of places to visit, from woodlands full of birdsong to a relaxing beach which sparked happy memories. Once in the virtual environment users can see and hear everything all around them and have the option to move to different areas within that location using the controller.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had very positive feedback from patients. This is a great example of the ways in which Natural England\u2019s Nature Recovery Projects are connecting people with nature \u2013 even from within a hospital\u2019s walls.\u00a0 Our work with the University of Bradford has helped us to understand more about how nature therapy might link with virtual reality research."

Staff have told me that they are exploring the idea of installing a camera in one of the boxes to watch the activity inside."

They have had a combination of in-person and online training over 5 months. They are all enthusiastic about bringing their therapy group outside and have self-organised a community of practice to support each other and bid for shared kit."

Living willow gazebos provide welcome spots for nature connection for the hardworking NHS Ambulance staff who work from the site. Alexis Percival, Yorkshire Ambulance Service, Sustainability Manager, invited staff to use their volunteering time to dig ponds, plant fruit trees and create dead hedges for wildlife, in particular, planting Tansy to encourage the iconic local Tansy Beetle. This links to wider nature recovery work in York Vale."
