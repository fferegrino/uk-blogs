This could mean that people do not take the action that we need them to and may lead to more pollution entering the lake. To really make a difference, we need to take action to reduce phosphorus from every source. Read more: Reedbed Restoration - SCRT\u00a0"

            "text": "One of the questions I am often asked is why we are seeing an increase in algal blooms in Windermere if phosphorus levels are declining? To answer that we need to consider the impact of climate change. The surface temperature of the lake has increased by 1C since the 1950s which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it can have a big impact. Higher temperatures, less rainfall during the summer and more intense rainfall events which increase the amount of phosphorus entering the lake from runoff can lead to more algal blooms.\u00a0\u00a0"
