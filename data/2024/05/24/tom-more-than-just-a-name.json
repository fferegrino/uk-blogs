It\u2019s not surprising really when you think about it: they\u2019re usually in reactive roles and so are juggling many different plates at the same time.\u00a0 It also means that when they come together in a big group, they\u2019re interested in defining the problems and finding the solutions quickly."

But with our two new departments being set up, having to onboard 1000s of staff, create new secure systems for each, dealing with staff from different departments having different knowledge levels of what processes and governance they should be following but all wanting to try new things, as well as us not having defined processes for everything\u2026..we needed a team that could help push forward the changes, so we didn\u2019t lose momentum or direction."

In ICS Digital, it\u2019s the word you\u2019ll hear mentioned whenever there\u2019s something that needs to be fixed with how we work.

The day job keeps going on around us all, but hopefully by the end, even if you\u2019ve not decided to engage, you\u2019ll be working in a team that is more joined up and effective."

We\u2019re also changing the way that we work in our team, to adopt a more account management approach. So we can get in on the conversations a lot earlier, improve Digital understanding within the departments and be a point of escalation when things aren\u2019t going to plan."
