We publish our opinions on IAs, which state whether the department\u2019s estimate of the direct costs of the measure and the assessment of the impacts on small and micro businesses is fit for purpose or not; we also rate the quality of the assessment of: \u2018rationale and objectives\u2019, \u2018cost-benefit analysis\u2019, \u2018wider impacts\u2019, and \u2018monitoring and evaluation\u2019 (these are rated either \u2018good\u2019, \u2018satisfactory\u2019, \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019)."

            "text": "While our ratings and quality assessments are in the public domain, they sit in individual RPC opinions, it is therefore difficult to see trends in the data and to compare the performance of different departments. The Government\u2019s White Paper on Smarter Regulation\u00a0 (published last week) stated that it would \u201csupport the Regulatory Policy Committee to publish data that enables scrutiny of departments\u2019 performance against the Better Regulation Framework\u201d. We believe that the transparency and accountability that this provides will help to strengthen adherence to the Framework. We have therefore decided to publish a spreadsheet that summarises the key information across all of our published IA opinions since late 2020 (when we started using our current template)."
