Within the Civil Service we have highly capable and engaged civil servants, as a modern Civil Service we are helping civil servants develop further capability and identify skill gaps. This helps to create the right environment to enable us to really deliver great services for the public.\u00a0"

As one of my early line managers said, it's about bringing your best self to work. And I would share that advice with everyone; be authentic, be yourself. Someone said to me a few years ago \u201cCarol, your difference is your superpower.\u201d I'm a northerner. I'm a black woman. I came from a working class background, which is not the typical civil servant that I have always seen."

I\u2019ve mentioned differences and that's so important when you're different from other people in your team. They've got to know me as a person and they have identified the support that would help me deliver a better service. So for example, when I became a chief probation officer, my line manager at the time put me in touch with some experienced chief probation officers, as part of an action learning set. This meant I could actually learn from them directly and gain that valuable insight and experience."

In turn, leaders should have confidence that they receive clear direction from their own line manager while also inspiring the same behaviours in their supporting teams. But you also have to be a manager that challenges your colleagues to be their best and see their potential and really listen. Another thing that\u2019s important is to show vulnerability and that means sometimes admitting you don't know all the answers.\u00a0\u00a0"

We found that the quality of the line management experience is absolutely crucial to employee experience. We learned from the research what affects delivery performance and business outcomes \u2014 this is all about how we can better deliver for the public.

Civil servants also want to be challenged by their line managers but also to be managed with empathy. Managers reflected on the importance of creating space and time to prioritise line management activities. I would say, listen, listen, listen, and reflect. It's important to provide feedback and also be open to receiving feedback. So there's some active listening, reflecting, being able to provide feedback and clear direction.\u00a0"
