PETs refer to a range of digital technologies and techniques that enable the collection, processing, analysis, and sharing of information while safeguarding data confidentiality and privacy (OECD, 2023)."

            "text": "For example, data obfuscation tools such as synthetic data combined with differential privacy can be used to generate insights or AI models without exposing sensitive or confidential data. In financial services, for instance, they can be applied to financial datasets for fraud detection and credit scoring without exposing the data of specific transactions or clients. And in health care, researchers can use these tools for disease prediction, drug discovery, and health policy analysis without accessing actual patient records, thus preserving patient privacy (see DSIT\u2019s repository of real-world use cases that leverage emerging PETs for further examples)."

            "text": "However, the technical complexity and rapid evolution of PETs presents significant challenges not only for policymakers and regulators but also for organisations seeking to implement PETs into their existing business processes and data governance frameworks. This challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that the application of many PETs is confined to specific use cases, which remain largely unknown to prospective users. This raises questions about possible case-specific challenges that need to be addressed as policymakers and regulators seek to achieve wider, more effective, and appropriate adoption of PETs, in line with their regulatory and policy frameworks."

            "text": "The UK government has led various initiatives to help realise the opportunities presented by PETs to enable trustworthy use of data. This included the UK-US PETs prize challenges, delivered jointly with US government partners, which challenged participants to develop privacy-preserving solutions\u00a0 capable of efficiently generating high-utility machine learning models for one of two predefined use-cases in finance and public health."

The implementation of AI-based solutions has emerged as a common thread in many of the Partnership\u2019s strands, and the workshop allowed us to learn from each other's approaches to ensuring privacy preserving innovation and building compatible approaches between EU and UK regulatory frameworks."
