Shortly after that we will be in a position to end section 21 for existing tenancies."

            "text": "On the issue of children in temporary accommodation, the Housing Secretary said the rise had been, in part, due to the increasing pressure on housing supply. Temporary accommodation exists to make sure families are not left without a roof over their heads. We are giving councils \u00a31.2 billion so that they can give financial support to those who need it, helping them to find a new home and move out of temporary accommodation."
