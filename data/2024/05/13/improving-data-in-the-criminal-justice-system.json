            "text": "However, there are opportunities for improvement. The Criminal Justice System data is owned and managed by each individual CJS organisation which presents several challenges. Siloed systems, inefficient processes and the absence of a unified approach to CJS data mean that the flow of data across the CJS slow and difficult. This often results in strategic \u2014 policy and operational \u2014 decisions being made without access to the latest cross-system data."

Our mission is to enable data-driven decision-making that harnesses the full breadth of data across the system.\u00a0 The programme's work will act as the basis for driving better evidenced policies, improved insight of operational performance, and an enhanced understanding of the end-to-end CJS."

For example, the award-winning Splink data linking methodology developed by MoJ has been used by the Data First programme to support researchers with access to linked data from across the justice system, and by the Better Outcomes through Linked Data (BOLD) programme to demonstrate the value of linked data through targeted cross-government pilots. The National Crime and Justice Lab in the Home Office has also started delivering insights by linking different police and Home Office data sets."

The lessons learned and successes achieved in this initiative serve as a catalyst for a more robust, data-driven approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our criminal justice processes."

Through user research, we have identified an opportunity to build on this work through developing dashboards tailored specifically for Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJBs). These new dashboards will provide LCJBs access to previously unseen linked CJS data, that allows them to better analyse the effects of policies, measure operational performance, and model fluctuations in demand."
