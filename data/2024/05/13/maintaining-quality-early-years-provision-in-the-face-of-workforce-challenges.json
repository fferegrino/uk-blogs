Some of these are big systemic challenges that you have little or no control over, for example the quality of qualifications that your staff receive. But there are some challenges that you can influence and remedy to some extent, for example the quality of leadership and how much attention you pay to staff well-being."

Without a consistent key person, it is harder to recognise and meet a child\u2019s individual needs. The key person relationship is especially important during periods of transition, for example if one of your children is moving into the next room for their age or is preparing to transition to school or another childcare setting. It is vital that, during these periods, your staff know the children well. And they need to be able to communicate children\u2019s learning and development to parents, carers and other practitioners for the next stage."
