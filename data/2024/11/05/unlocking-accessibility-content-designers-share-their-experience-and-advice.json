This, combined with seeing GDS slides (or it might have been the Home Office posters) describing how people could have a temporary, situational or permanent disability was a real lightbulb moment for me. I\u2019d come from a publishing background, where accessibility just wasn\u2019t considered. The idea of giving people what they need, when they need it, and in a way that\u2019s accessible to everyone was a space I knew I wanted to work in. This led me into content design.\u201d"
