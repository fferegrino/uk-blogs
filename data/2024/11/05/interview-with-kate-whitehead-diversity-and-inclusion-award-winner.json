            "text": "Kate: I am one of six Area Forensic Managers for Regional Scientific Support Services (RSSS) which provides forensic services to West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Humberside Police. My role is incredibly varied and consists of co-ordinating Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and specialist resources at serious and major crime scenes. It also includes developing strategies to maximise forensic evidence, working with major crime teams to identify and convict offenders, managing a team of CSI supervisors and having oversight for RSSS health and safety and also diversity, equality and inclusion within the department. The work of RSSS and my role as Area Forensic Manager has recently been featured in a documentary TV series produced by Channel 5 entitled \u2018Forensics \u2013 Murder Scene\u2019."

            "text": "Kate: Having gained a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Science, I initially worked for the HSE Health and Safety Laboratory but had always had a keen interest in forensic science and analytical techniques, particularly toxicology. I saw the role of a Scenes of Crime Officer advertised locally and decided to apply \u2013 I liked the idea of combining my scientific background with helping victims and detecting crime. After a number of years, I was promoted to the role of CSI Supervisor and then subsequently Area Forensic Manager and I am now based in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. As Area Forensic Manager, I have oversight for the team of CSI\u2019s and I quickly noticed that as a department we were not very ethnically diverse, the same can be said for policing in general, not just forensics. I really believe that in order to work effectively with the local community we must also represent it, so I approached our Senior Leadership Team and volunteered to lead on improving diversity, equality and inclusion within RSSS."

            "text": "Kate: I wasn\u2019t even aware I had been nominated for the award by my line manager, so to win was a huge surprise, at first, I even thought the email telling me I was a winner was some sort of scam. It feels incredible to have the work I do recognised on a national level, but I genuinely feel that the recognition is unwarranted, I am simply \u2018doing my job\u2019. Promoting diversity and inclusion within RSSS and West Yorkshire Police is just another important part of my role. Attending the Government Science and Engineering conference was very enjoyable (and somewhat daunting), but I felt proud to be representing West Yorkshire Police within such an assorted collection of government departments."
