This test represents our next step in understanding how we can use AI to provide simple, helpful tools that save people time. This work is being led by the GOV.UK AI team, a multidisciplinary group of civil servants that includes data scientists alongside developers, user researchers and designers."

When we first tested the tool with hundreds of invited users in late 2023, our results showed nearly 70% of users found the chatbot\u2019s responses were useful, and just under 65% were satisfied with the experience. These findings demonstrated the positive impact this technology could have for users looking to access government information and services."

This means managing the risk of \u2018hallucinations\u2019 \u2013 where the system generates responses containing incorrect information presented as fact \u2013 is part of working with this technology right now."

For example, throughout the development of GOV.UK Chat we\u2019ve carried out \u201cred teaming\u201d exercises. This is where colleagues from across government have tried their hardest to \u201cjailbreak\u201d the system or make it not behave as intended."
