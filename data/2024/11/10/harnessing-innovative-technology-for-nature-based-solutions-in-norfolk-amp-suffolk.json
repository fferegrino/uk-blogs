From protecting rivers to revolutionising agriculture and even understanding wildlife, advanced tools like drones and artificial intelligence (AI) are being used to better manage and protect our natural world.\u00a0"

            "text": "Instance segmentation (a type of AI) is being trained to recognise individual seals from drone imagery, draw a line around them, and count them. It is intelligent enough to distinguish between older seals and whitecoat pups, and also between multiple seals grouped closely together."
        },
        {
            "text": "Historically, collecting this type of data has been a challenge when using the traditional method of manual ground surveys and aerial surveys. Drones can reach sand banks and rocky beaches inaccessible to human observers. With powerful zoom lenses, the drones can record the seals and their pups from a height of 110m, minimising disturbance to the mammals."

This footage will be shared with landowners and environmental partners to discuss restoration proposals and explore Natural Flood Management (NFM) solutions."

        {
            "text": "NFM is an approach that works with nature, not against it. Instead of relying on traditional flood defences like walls and dams, NFM focuses on natural techniques like tree planting, wetland creation, and river re-meandering to slow water flow."

        {
            "text": "This, in turn, creates and interconnects habitats for wildlife and improves soil structure and quality by reducing uncontrolled flooding, run-off and loss of topsoil. This approach can turn less productive farmland into vibrant wetlands that not only absorb excess water and carbon but also support biodiversity."

These crops help reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and encourage biodiversity, all while benefiting the crops harvested later by making nitrogen more available in the soil."

Whether it's managing flood risk, improving farming practices with precision planting by a drone, or understanding wildlife behaviour along our coasts, these innovations are showing how modern tools can work in harmony, not against, nature."
