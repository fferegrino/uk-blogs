This was set out in the ICH Reflection paper on Renovation of Good Clinical Practice and the ICH E6(R3) Concept Paper and a Business Plan was developed. ICH E6(R3) has been restructured and is composed of an overarching principles section, Annex 1 (interventional clinical trials), Annex 2 (additional considerations for non-traditional interventional clinical trials), Glossary and Appendices."

I encourage you to provide your comments, in the consultation, this should be done by submitting your comments via an uploaded Excel\u00ae spreadsheet. Please note we have also asked a few questions to obtain UK stakeholder views on whether Annex 2 has realised the objectives set out in the concept paper for it."
