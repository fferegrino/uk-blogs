GIS is a tool that links data to maps, integrating location data with other descriptive information. It allows people to create maps and analyse data and is used in almost every industry."

We use it to control our schemes and to evidence whether environmental improvement goals are being met. Geospatial data and technology are fundamental to the success of RPA\u2019s land management schemes, making it possible to preserve the environment while still producing the food we need.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Farming recovery payments\u00a0Geospatial data was also used by RPA to support farmers affected by Storm Babet and Storm Henk after the severe wet weather during this period. RPA was able to provide a one-off Recovery Payment to around 13,000 farmers to help cover the uninsured costs of restoring farmland. Environment Agency and Met Office data was used to identify which farm businesses received the recovery payment. Data on river flooding and exceptional rainfall allowed us to pinpoint affected land and make payments directly to eligible farms. There was no need for farmers to apply for funding and using the data meant payments could be made quickly, without further evidence.\u00a0"

This option focuses on providing food for birds over winter. Farmers in AB9 plant certain types of plants in spring which flower in the summer, release seeds in autumn and which then provides food for birds in winter.\u00a0"

The team track satellite images of the features we want to assess, whether that\u2019s bare soil, or different types of vegetation or stubble. This information is then used to identify what RPA Field Officers, in a partnership approach, can do to better support farmers with their agreements. This involves providing advice, support and guidance, so farmers can have greater confidence delivering their agreement options.\u00a0The use of GIS across government is broad and you can find some examples that were recognised in the Geography in Government Awards, from informing national policy, to delivering public services at a local level.\u00a0"
