It highlights a decline in the quality of analysis by government departments \u2013 with only 59% of IAs being rated fit for purpose at first submission last year (compared to 82% in 2020-21), and with almost three-quarters (72%) of IAs receiving one or more \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019 quality ratings. It also lists the 10 instances during the year where we had to issue a statement on our website criticising a government department for the lateness or absence of an IA. The report also comments on the continued failure of departments to complete PIRs."

This contains a number of proposals we have long advocated, such as earlier scrutiny of IAs, a greater emphasis on monitoring and evaluation and publishing data on departments\u2019 performance against the BRF. We were proud to hold the successful launch event for the revised BRF at the House of Lords with over 150 guests, as well as having regular engagement with a wide range of stakeholders."
