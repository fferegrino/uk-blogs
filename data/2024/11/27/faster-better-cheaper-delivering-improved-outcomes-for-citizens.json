Whether these are wrapped up in policies or programmes, the underlying driver is about meeting citizens\u2019 needs through good services. In MHCLG we emphasise that digital is more than digitising things or adopting new tools \u2013 it\u2019s a critical partner in shaping responsive, innovative and efficient government. Digital is about working smarter, streamlining how we operate, making policies more responsive, and creating a culture of collaboration.\u00a0"
