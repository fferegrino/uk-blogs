Natural England\u2019s People and Nature Survey shows that in the West Midlands, visiting the natural environment at least once a week is something that 64% of people in the most deprived postcodes report doing, compared to 75% in the least deprived postcodes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

At the Turner\u2019s Wood Nature Reserve, we are supporting the Birmingham and the Black Country Wildlife Trust in creating a Friends of Group of residents to be more involved in the management of the site."

The planting of scented, colourful wildflowers and shrubs aims to activate people\u2019s senses, whilst also benefiting insects and birds.\u00a0 We are funding three \u2018Wellbeing in Nature\u2019 sessions in the renovated garden through Community Interest Company, Mettaminds. These sessions will include Tai Chi, nature photography, sketching, mindful breathing techniques and focusing on the five senses. We hope the sessions will promote greater use of nature-rich spaces by staff and patients, deepening their connection to nature."
