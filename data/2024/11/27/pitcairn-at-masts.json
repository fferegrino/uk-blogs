Recently awarded a platinum-level Blue Park Award, the marine protected area (MPA) preserves a rare, fully intact marine ecosystem within its expansive 842,000 Km2 boundary. Therefore, it provides sanctuary to over 1,250 marine species from vibrant coral reefs to endangered humpback whales and rare sea birds.\u00a0"

The younger generation is often overlooked yet are the very reason many scientific expeditions gather the data they do. It was a boost to our younger people that our contribution to science is impactful, meaningful, and important. Hopefully more people will be inspired by the science data that was presented, and more opportunities will become available to more scientists to visit Pitcairn.\u00a0"
