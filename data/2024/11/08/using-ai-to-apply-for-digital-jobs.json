            "text": "ICS Digital staff have all recently attended mandatory refresher training on recruitment. The question of AI and applications appeared a lot as it\u2019s clear that it is being used more and more. At the moment, it\u2019s fairly clear when someone is using AI in their application, the answer is generally less specific and as a result, often lower scoring. When you have over 200 applications (as some of our roles get), it\u2019s also easy to spot patterns in the answers, where more than one person has used the same AI interface and received a similarly worded suggestion.\u00a0"

When you give your STAR shaped examples, we can learn a lot about you and the way you approach challenges and opportunities. Even with a word limit, your tone of voice can tell us a lot about the type of person you are.\u00a0\u00a0"

We will keep finding the best way to find out about you, your skills and experience.
