As pricing algorithms become more sophisticated it is increasingly important that you understand how prices are set. Where rival businesses use the same algorithmic system to set prices this can allow the exchange of confidential information (such as pricing plans, future market strategies, stock levels or spare capacity) between them. It can also help them to coordinate their behaviour instead of competing with each other."
