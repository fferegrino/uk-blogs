The clubs provide pupils and teachers with the digital skills needed to begin their digital journey. Since 2014, with the support of volunteers from across DVLA, the programme has hosted several after-school clubs, as well as reaching out to the community to provide digital upskilling to a wide range of people."

I still remember the first event; we were all full of anticipation and excitement."

            "text": "Over the course of a day, we guided school children through interactive coding activities, which showcased the talent that the children had, increased their confidence, and encouraged businesses to start their own STEM programmes. Ten new code clubs started in the region as a direct result of this first code event."

It\u2019s a real privilege to have been able to witness the development of their digital skills. Each year, we\u2019re astounded with what our future digital innovators can achieve."

By using our experience as a digital employer, combined with our commitment to support the next generation, we\u2019ve been able to illustrate the fundamental importance that digital skills have at a young age."

It challenges learners across Wales to create games using coding in the hope of winning some exciting prizes for their school or college. It\u2019s a privilege to support school children across Wales, and our annual Code Challenge is a great celebration of this."

            "text": "Using coding and other digital skills, children are encouraged to use their imagination and team work to build exciting games, create a video and, if they get through to the final, present these on stage in front of a live audience. It\u2019s much more than just a game, with the creations often tackling real-world problems such as sustainability and humanitarian aid. Every year, I\u2019m blown away by the calibre of nominations and the sheer determination to push the envelope that much further."

It also includes the Commerce in Code Challenge, which encourages students aged 16 to 18 to submit a tender to redesign the Code Challenge website. The process includes design briefs, specifications, requirements and a commercial scoring matrix, giving students the feel of business and IT in a real-world situation."
