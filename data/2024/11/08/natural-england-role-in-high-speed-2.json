The need for the structure was identified by HS2 Ltd more than 10 years ago, following extensive surveying of bat populations by its own ecologists in the vicinity of Sheephouse Wood. "

They are one of the world's rarest bat species, with fewer than ten estimated breeding colonies in in the whole of England. There is ample evidence - despite claims made to the contrary - that they are at risk of colliding with high-speed trains."
