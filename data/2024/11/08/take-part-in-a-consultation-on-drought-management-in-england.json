However, dry weather can come unexpectedly \u2013 as we saw in the summer of 2022. Our changing climate means we could see more frequent and severe weather events, including droughts, in the coming years, and we ought to think of floods and drought as two sides of the same coin. We cannot control when the next drought will be, or how severe it will be, but we can work together now to improve our preparation and resilience to dry weather and drought.\u00a0"

This can also coincide with periods of high temperatures when demand for water also substantially increases. Each drought is different and varies in nature, timing and impacts. There is therefore not a single definition of drought, but we do classify them in three broad categories: environmental, agricultural or water supply droughts.\u00a0"

By 2050, without action, we expect a shortfall in England of nearly 5 billion litres of water a day between the sustainable water supplies available and the expected demand. The Environment Agency, and other regulators review water companies Water Resource Management Plans to ensure the actions they plan to take will deliver the resilient and sustainable water supplies we all need up to 2050. The Environment Agency and Ofwat also review water company performance annually.\u00a0"
