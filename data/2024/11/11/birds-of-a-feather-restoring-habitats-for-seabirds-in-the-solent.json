            "text": "Located on the New Forest coastline, our North Solent NNR is one of our largest nature reserves. It includes a series of waterbodies, protected by a sea wall, that are regularly visited by a range of birds. As the nights get darker and colder, the reserve comes to life with a whole host of grazing and foraging waders and wildfowl, and in spring, the air is thick with the calls of avian residents, including lapwing, avocets and spoonbills."

            "text": "This used to be one of the key sites for breeding terns in the Solent, and terns are regularly seen feeding in the area. However, no terns have successfully bred on this site for several years. My team set out to explore the reasons why, and hopefully change this."

            "text": "The hunt for shingle - what makes a tern return?Our starting point was answering the question: what does it take to make a tern want to come back to your site? In April our breeding seabirds, including terns, undertake the long migration from West Africa in the hunt for suitable shingle areas to nest. Shingle \u2013 made up of small, rounded pebbles and rocks - makes an ideal nesting habitat for terns, and other breeding seabirds, as they can create scrapes in the stones to lay their eggs which are then camouflaged by the pebbles. However, around the UK coastline suitable natural shingle habitat is in decline as a result of multiple factors, including sea level rise, increasing tidal surges and disturbance. This means that in the Solent there are only a handful of places left where our seabirds can successfully nest and raise a chick without the risk of being disturbed. We knew that restoring this habitat would be key."

            "text": "Testing the theory.On a rather wet and windy day in April 2024, our incredible North Solent NNR staff and volunteers, working alongside the landowner, installed a single shingle topped raft into one of the lagoons on North Solent NNR. We wanted to test the theory that if shingle was available, breeding seabirds would use it. The rafts included some tern decoys, created in partnership with the local Countryside Education Trust, to further encourage terns to nest."

            "text": "Our experiment proved to be a success, with the first common terns to successfully breed on North Solent NNR for around 20 years nesting on the raft this spring / summer. This demonstrated that by putting suitable nesting habitat into this lagoon, terns would come. The next question was, can we scale this up?"

            "text": "In September 2024, funded by The Solent Seascape Project, work began on the creation of six shingle islands in two waterbodies located on North Solent NNR, one of which is where the raft was installed earlier in the year. This narrow window of time was chosen to ensure that the works did not disturb the final breeding birds leaving the site, or the overwintering birds soon to be arriving. To do this safely, the lagoons had to be fully drained, and diggers brought in to create mud islands topped with shingle, which is no small feat."

        {
            "text": "These waterbodies are located just behind a sea wall and on a restricted access site and so will not only be protected from rising sea levels but also from high levels of disturbance. It is hoped this will provide the perfect habitat for when our terns start to return in Spring 2025."

            "text": "During the winter, vast numbers of wading birds, including black-tailed godwits, dunlin and oystercatchers, make the long migration from their breeding grounds to the Solent and need a safe place to rest and recover. Therefore, whilst these islands have been created to provide suitable habitat for breeding seabirds, it is hoped that they will also provide protected high tide roosting sites for our overwintering birds."

Through our work with Ocean Conservation Trust as part of the EU funded LIFE Recreation ReMEDIES project, we have started to turn the tide on the loss of seagrass in the area through a restoration trial at the mouth of the Beaulieu River. Seagrass provides a really important nursery function for many fish species and so may help provide some much-needed prey to feed any seabird chicks. \u00a0"
