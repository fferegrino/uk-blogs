This is a time when we unite to remember all who have served, both past and present, in conflicts that span the years. We celebrate them, their selfless service, and bravery."

            "text": "Remembrance is a deeply personal and emotional experience, and one that holds great significance for those who have served. As a veteran, and a reservist of the UK military, I have had the honour and privilege of serving my country, at home and abroad, in a variety of theatres, deploying to Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Counter Daesh. During these formative experiences I witnessed incredible courage and selflessness first-hand and formed lifelong friendships."
