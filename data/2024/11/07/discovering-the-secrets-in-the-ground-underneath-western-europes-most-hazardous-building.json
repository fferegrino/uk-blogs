It was the older generation of sampling boreholes which confirmed the impact of the first underground leak from the silo in the 1970s. The liquor released then was over 50 times more radioactive than the liquid seeping out now."

            "text": "Today\u2019s liquor is far more diluted, not only because of the radioactive half-life of the waste put in there in the 1960s, but also because we\u2019re constantly topping up the silo with demineralised water to keep the waste safely submerged. Liquor is seeping out of an unseen, unreachable crack at a rate of 1.7 litres per minute \u2013 so that\u2019s the rate we fill at the top."

These layers have tiered up over millions of years as glaciers tumbling down from the fells or sweeping in from the Irish Sea have brushed their deposits back and forth to build up a geological \u2018trifle\u2019."

The deepest borehole was 50 metres down \u2013 that\u2019s the same height as Nelson\u2019s Column. Drilling deep holes on a congested nuclear site with a history like Sellafield\u2019s is as complicated as you would imagine."
