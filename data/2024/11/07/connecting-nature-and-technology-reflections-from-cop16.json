Nearly two years after COP15 in Montreal, where 196 countries agreed to protect at least 30% of the world\u2019s land and oceans by 2030, COP16 saw the world stage come together in Colombia."

The Government Digital Sustainability Alliance (GDSA), which I\u2019m a member of, has formed a working group of key technology alliance partners to go beyond carbon in understanding the planetary impacts arising from technology, and to understand how these unintended consequences can be measured, monitored and mitigated. We\u2019re meeting again in the next couple of weeks, and I for one am optimistic about what we might achieve going forward."
