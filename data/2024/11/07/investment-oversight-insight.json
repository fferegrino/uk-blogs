However, the structures and policies apply more broadly across institutional investors and the work of government where it can be a stakeholder in establishing or reviewing a fund."

            "text": "In implementing an investment strategy, the pursuit of returns and management of investment risks can lead to a desire to set criteria to encourage, or even try to ensure, a desired outcome. Adding rules can help to ensure that those responsible for investments, such as trustees and investment committees, are thorough, and use rules to ensure consistency and manage exposure to certain risks."

            "text": "However, adding too many rules, albeit with good intention, can also create some risks, often considered to be a check-list mentality.
