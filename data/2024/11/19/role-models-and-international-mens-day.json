This year\u2019s theme, \u201cRole Models\u201d invites us to explore the powerful impact that positive male figures can have on individuals, families, and communities. It\u2019s also an invitation for organisations like ours to embrace and uplift these role models who champion diversity and inclusivity in their everyday lives."

Our stories, our messages, and our role models are instrumental in fostering an environment that values equity and celebrates the unique contributions each person brings to the table."

            "text": "Role models shape our understanding of what is possible. They influence our ambitions and our perceptions of ourselves and others, inspiring us to achieve more and contribute positively. For young men, role models can help break down stereotypes, particularly those that create limits around who they can become based on race, background, or other identities. In today\u2019s interconnected and multicultural workplaces, inclusive role models are essential in promoting acceptance, encouraging open-mindedness, and setting the example of allyship."

            "text": "Through my work with the DIO Race Network Committee, I have had the privilege of highlighting stories of men who break barriers and advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Whether these are leaders who champion diversity initiatives, mentors who support others in their career growth, or peers who foster safe spaces for open dialogue, these role models encourage us to view everyone through a lens of respect and understanding."

        {
            "text": "A key focus of our committee is to ensure that we highlight the stories of diverse men who model the values of integrity, empathy, and resilience. By sharing these stories widely, we aim to showcase a variety of experiences and backgrounds, reminding us that role models come in many forms. This visibility can have a profound effect on others within the organisation, inspiring colleagues to see themselves as agents of change and advocates for inclusion."

        {
            "text": "Furthermore, these role models help bridge the gap between underrepresented groups and larger communities, promoting allyship and understanding. The power of seeing someone like yourself in a leadership role, or hearing stories of resilience in the face of adversity, can motivate others to reach for similar heights, ultimately benefitting the entire community."

            "text": "On this International Men\u2019s Day, let us honour the men in our lives who embody the values of inclusivity and compassion, who led by example, and who inspire others to grow. Role models are not just the leaders we read about or the mentors we\u2019ve had; they are also our colleagues, our friends, and our family members who, through their everyday actions, show us what it means to be genuinely supportive and inclusive."

Together, we can continue to build a future where everyone feels seen, valued, and empowered to be a role model."
