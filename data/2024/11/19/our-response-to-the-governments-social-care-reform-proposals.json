The \u2018care market\u2019 has changed considerably since the Care Standards Act 2000. We were clear in\u00a0our response to the Care Review\u2019s Case for Change that legislation has not kept pace. In particular, many children\u2019s homes are now part of large groups."

They want to ensure that no provider is too big to fail and that a provider exiting the market would not leave a glaring gap for children. This is very welcome and something we have long called for."

This is and should be different from a secure children\u2019s home. We welcome this in principle, but how it is implemented will be critical to its success.

These arrangements play a vital role in the care and protection of children and learners. Education practitioners spend the most time with children, so it is unsurprising that education settings made the second largest number of referrals of cases into children\u2019s social care last year. The proposed changes have real potential to support better multi-agency working to protect children. It\u2019s important that we learn from the pathfinders and those partnerships that already have successful ways of doing this, so that we build on what works."

I am sure there will be a great deal to learn from how this has worked. If these teams become mandatory, and as practice develops, we will consider how it impacts on our inspections of local authority children\u2019s services and joint targeted area inspections. We will also work with our partner inspectorates to make sure we have proper oversight of these teams."
