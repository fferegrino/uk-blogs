I am grateful for the award of the UNZA-VMD scholarship, which intends to evaluate the prescribing practices of veterinary medicines for treating mastitis in dairy cattle among non-veterinary personnel in Lusaka and Chongwe districts of Zambia."

            "text": "I am a veterinarian by profession, with a Bachelor's degree in veterinary medicine from The University of Zambia. Following my graduation (2019), I have served as a small animal clinician, animal welfare organization veterinarian, agroveterinary responsible person (veterinarian and consultant) as well as dairy animal veterinarian. My wide knowledge of experience provides a link among the fields veterinary medicine, agriculture and public health. Thus, this gives me an opportunity to ensure responsible antimicrobial use (AMU) through regulating non-prescription sale of veterinary medicines. Hence, my research will generate evidence-based insights that will inform policy reforms, regulatory interventions, and public health strategies to promote responsible antimicrobial use and mitigation of risks of antimicrobial use (antimicrobial resistance), thus improving animal health and animal welfare in the dairy industry."

My research questions, were structured around the Simulated farmer (SF) survey approach which allows the researcher to collect reliable data regarding the non-prescription sale of medicines without alarming prescribers. The approach was adopted from the human medicine setup."

            "text": "So far, the findings from the preliminary data collected revealed the evidence of non-prescription sale and dispensing of veterinary medicines for treating mastitis in dairy cattle among non-veterinary personnel. Preliminary findings have shown that agroveterinary and retail pharmacy attendants can sell and dispense veterinary medicines without a prescription as long as the products are stocked. The findings revealed that the majority of the prescribers were willing to dispense the products without asking about the symptoms of the disease, previous medication used to treat the infection and possible symptoms to look out for in case of future infections. The study also revealed that the non-veterinary personnel did not give further instruction regarding the duration of treatment, route of administration and withdrawal period for the products dispensed, thus resulting in a high chance of future antimicrobial resistance (AMR) cases."
