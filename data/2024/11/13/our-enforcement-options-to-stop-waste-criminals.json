The severity of waste crimes varies greatly and our response to each incident is proportionate to the permit breach or offence committed, the scale of the offence and impact upon the environment and communities.\u00a0\u00a0"

We expect the operator to listen to our advice and take appropriate action to remedy their error, to return to compliance and stay compliant."

Some of these provide us with powers to issue enforcement notices, which must be complied with or when an offence is committed.

            "text": "Preparing prosecution cases to present to court takes considerable time and resources. We may only proceed with a prosecution if we have sufficient evidence to be satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of securing a conviction and that it is in the public interest to start criminal proceedings. With that decision made, we can sometimes face long delays to get a court date or to proceed with a case in court. This can make it seem to onlookers that we haven\u2019t acted quickly enough, but court dates are outside of our control. So too are the sentences imposed by the court. The court determines the punishments for the cases we bring before them, and we try to assist the court to come to the right sentence. Whilst we do sometimes feel the sentences are not severe enough this is not a matter for us."

Additionally, they do not fully cover our existing regulatory costs, and some areas, such as waste exemptions, receive no funding at all. This has put considerable strain on our regulatory activities and must be addressed."
