It\u2019s part of a wider effort to discover more about the species and habitats found in our waters, and will eventually feed into new monitoring recommendations for our inshore waters including, but not limited to, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).\u00a0"

Natural capital describes the parts of our environment that have value to people \u2013 like healthy seas which support food production, or saltmarshes which help buffer coastlines against storm surges.

Three years ago, specialists joined the mNCEA programme and began reviewing what evidence existed for marine mammals that could be made available for natural capital assessments. The review identified a need for more ecological data, more data on the ways these wide-ranging, highly mobile species help to maintain and regulate a stable marine environment, and more information on their cultural value to society.\u00a0"

            "text": "Our current main sources of data on cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises) in UK seas are international coordinated surveys funded by governments and staffed largely by volunteers. Citizen science organisation Sea Watch coordinates casual land-based sightings, while ORCA organises volunteer surveys along commercial ferry routes. However, we still lack detailed data for our inshore waters (within 12 nautical miles of shore). mNCEA is therefore investigating additional methods to help us create a picture that encompasses all our seas, from coast to continental shelf.\u00a0"

These were placed in the waters off the north-east coast of England to record the clicks which dolphins and porpoises use to locate each other and their prey. This data tells us about where these mammals spend time, and what their feeding patterns are.\u00a0"

Our economists asked the public to give their opinion on how much they were willing to pay (or, conversely, would need to be paid) for different scenarios in which populations of specific species increased or decreased by different amounts. "

When seawater is collected this can be filtered and analysed to show what animals have been recently present. This is a new technology, and we\u2019re still working out how best to incorporate it into our armoury of monitoring techniques.\u00a0"
