My role involves responding to planning applications on behalf of the council as the local highway authority. I also manage changes funded by developers to the highway network, use parts of the Highways Act on behalf of the council, and ensure compliance. I also provide guidance to colleagues in other teams dealing with planning applications as the local highway authority."

            "text": "James:\u00a0Yes, I am a civil engineer. I've been in this role for just over five years. Before this, I wasn't from a civil engineering background, I had been in the Army, and then worked in the outdoor industry, so this was a completely new direction for me. To make this change, I had to undertake further education, so I went to Leeds Beckett University as a mature student and gained my civil engineering qualifications there. It was a fantastic experience. I'm also studying at the Open University and will be finishing my studies next year."

            "text": "James:\u00a0Being an engineer is integral to my role as about 80% of my work involves technical checking, such as road construction details and drainage. Civil engineering forms the foundation of what I do, whether it's dealing with contractors on-site, or ensuring that all technical details are correct before adopting any works. Good communication skills are also essential, especially when explaining technical information to the public, who may not have a technical background."

            "text": "James:\u00a0I particularly enjoy geotechnical engineering and the construction of highways. It might sound boring to some, but I find it fascinating how carriageways are designed for different traffic tolerances and how the underlying soil affects the construction. Conducting tests to understand ground movement before laying down materials is something I find really interesting."

            "text": "James:\u00a0Being part of GSE has been quite enlightening and it has allowed me to see what's happening at a national level across different aspects of science and engineering. Additionally, GSE has provided opportunities for me to gain chartership with the Institute of Civil Engineers through its professional recognition offer and this is something I am working towards now. It has been great networking with other engineers from diverse departments and has made me feel more connected to what is happening across the government from my local government vantage point."
