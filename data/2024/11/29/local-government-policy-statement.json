The government is committed to keeping taxes on working people as low as possible and will not increase the main 5% council tax referendum threshold."

As is always the case, there are variations in the flexibilities proposed for different types of authorities, reflecting their circumstances.\u00a0Continuing this referendum threshold means voters have the final say over excessive council tax increases.\u202f\u00a0"

            "text": "The government is taking further action to simplify bills received by taxpayers, improve transparency and provide clarity on council tax increases by introducing regulations so that council tax bills issued from 25/26 will show a single line for council tax increases set by social care authorities and will also consider longer term options to improve council tax billing. Every council must also have a locally designed Local Council Tax Support to protect anyone facing financial hardship."

            "text": "The Policy Statement published yesterday (28/11) set out, as with previous years, where a council in need of exceptional financial support sees additional council tax increases as critical to maintaining their financial sustainability, the government will continue to consider requests for bespoke referendum principles."

            "text": "Local proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis and the impact on working people will be at the forefront of Ministers\u2019 consideration, alongside the councils\u2019 specific circumstances, for example their existing levels of council tax relative to the average and the strength of plans to protect vulnerable people. Ministers have been clear that agreement would only be given in exceptional circumstances."
