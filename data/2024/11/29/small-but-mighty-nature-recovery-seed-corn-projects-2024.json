This growing network of enhanced, better-connected wildlife-rich places supports biodiversity and species recovery. It will also enhance climate change resilience, give us access to clean air, water and healthy soil and improve health and wellbeing by connecting people with nature. Over recent years, one of the methods we have implemented with our partners to meet this challenge are small, locally based projects known as seed corn.\u00a0"

Since their inception and implementation in 2019, the NRN Local Delivery Team has worked with partners to oversee and launch over 400 of these mini but mighty projects across the country, with each costing less than \u00a325,000. Spanning all 12 of Natural England\u2019s area teams, seed corn projects have covered a wide range of project types. This includes on-site mapping and restoration work, research projects to inform future actions, habitat assessments and educational resources, which collectively are playing a significant role towards delivering the nature recovery network."

Projects have been shown to contribute to overarching organisational targets, helping to strengthen and grow the nature recovery network and the collaborative partnerships that it is dependent on. Flexibility and diversity were noted as being two of the programme\u2019s great strengths. Importantly, 96% of the projects reviewed were found to directly contribute to\u202fseed corn guiding principles: enhancing biodiversity, connecting local communities with nature; enhancing partnership networks; encouraging the inclusion of external partners; and directly expanding, connecting, and improving nature.\u00a0"

When approached for comment, partner organisations emphasised the importance of this type of funding in enabling project creation and research delivery.

This has extended existing support from NE\u2019s Cheshire to Lancashire team, enthusiastic partner organisations and volunteers, and encouraged innovative approaches to monitoring and peatland restoration.

After receiving \u00a33,458 in seed corn funding, tree planting commenced in earnest, with volunteers from the local community coming together to establish the orchard.\u00a0"
