Fortunately, this is where the parallel ends as we were not giving evidence. "

However, if costs fell below a floor, then benefits would be increased, or member contributions reduced. "

GAD had provided advice to HM Treasury as the Directions were developed to ensure that they understood the policy decisions they had to make about how the calculations would work and to ensure that the legislation was drafted to correctly implement those decisions. We had also provided an analysis of the impact of this decision on different groups which helped support the Equalities Impact Analysis which HM Treasury prepared when making the Directions."

All of GAD\u2019s advice relating to the decision to include the McCloud remedy costs in the cost cap mechanism was in scope.

While I do have a professional interest in the mortality of public servants, this was definitely an era beyond our actuarial training. "
