            "text": "The bacteria known as Campylobacter are a common cause of food poisoning in people. The majority of Campylobacter infections are linked to the handling and consumption of chicken meat as chickens can carry the bug in their guts and faeces. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is also a threat to infected patients who require antibiotic treatment as there is a risk that these medications will no longer be effective. Therefore, research into AMR in Campylobacter that can be found on chicken meat is important to ensure food safety for the consumer."

In line with this, Animal and Plant Health Agency\u2019s (APHA) collaboration with Qatar University aims to share expertise between bacteriology laboratories, support research to control the spread of AMR in food-borne pathogens and promote best practices to minimize consumer risks."

In January 2023, BRC scientist Miss Hana Adel Mohamed Abdelrahman visited APHA to learn laboratory methods and quality systems. A reciprocal visit by Dr Sandra Laborda Anadon and Mr James Coates followed to help implement the new methods at the BRC. These visits were supported by the Science & Innovation Network in Qatar of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)."

It featured presentations from APHA scientists Dr Sandra Laborda Anadon, Dr John Rodgers and Mr Alistair Davies, along with experts from Qatar University, and other Qatari institutions. The sessions were moderated by Dr. Nahla Eltai. The environment, food-production, veterinary and medical sectors were all represented to ensure the discussions had a \u2018One Health\u2019 perspective. Over 60 highly engaged attendees joined the three-day event that included \u2018hands-on\u2019 demonstrations."
