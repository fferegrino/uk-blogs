But, taken together, it should be clear that we\u2019re deliberately raising the bar for providers operating within our trusted ecosystem. It\u2019s essential that certification remains a real distinction for the most trustworthy services, and that we suitably safeguard the privileges that it brings."

We\u2019ll therefore soon also be launching our next round of stakeholder engagement, to gather feedback on the gamma publication and other guidance that together makes up the trust framework. This will help us develop the next publication, which we plan to release following the Data Bill\u2019s passage."
