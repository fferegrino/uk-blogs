When you register, you'll be invited to report any respiratory symptoms via the website on a weekly basis. It\u2019s quick and easy to submit the information, and you\u2019ll be playing a part in protecting the health of all of us across the country."

            "text": "As we approach another winter season, we are ramping up our comprehensive surveillance systems to monitor flu and other seasonal respiratory viruses. One of the ways we monitor these viruses this is through FluSurvey \u2013 an online platform that allows individuals to report symptoms weekly, providing real-time data on the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in the population. Not all people feeling unwell call 111 or visit their GP or hospital, and these people\u2019s symptoms may not be reflected in other surveillance systems. Community-based systems such as FluSurvey are not limited to people who visit healthcare settings; providing an early understanding of respiratory illness activity in the population. Using weekly symptoms data, we can measure the number of participants who are experiencing symptoms of respiratory illnesses as well as trends over the course of the winter."

            "text": "When added to our existing sources of information, the value of real-time data on respiratory illnesses, provided directly by households countrywide, is immense. It's like having thousands of health detectives scattered across the country, all working together to build a comprehensive picture of flu-like illnesses. By taking part in FluSurvey, you would be contributing a vital piece to a larger puzzle."
