Although the name felt like a bold suggestion at first, it perfectly captured our goal for the day - to explore how combining open data sets could help transform the planning system to support home-building targets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The government\u2019s brownfield-first approach, which prioritises the redevelopment of previously developed land, and the aim to build 1.5 million homes in the next 5 years has been on my mind a lot. Could we create a tool to inform the viability of brownfield sites, speeding up this part of the planning process? Could this be a way of showing the impact and power of having standardised data indexed in one central location?\u00a0"
