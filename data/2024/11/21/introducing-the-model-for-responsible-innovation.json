            "text": "The Model sets out a vision for what responsible innovation in AI looks like, and the component Fundamentals and Conditions required to build trustworthy AI. It also operates as a practical tool that public sector teams can use to rapidly identify the potential risks associated with the development and deployment of AI, and understand how to mitigate them."

Over the following years, we tested and iterated the Model to ensure its relevance to as wide a set of uses of data driven tech as possible. The result is a comprehensive framework that sets out every element that public sector teams need to think about to innovate responsibly."

        {
            "text": "Since we first developed the Model back in 2021, we\u2019ve used it in to run red-teaming workshops with public sector teams. These workshops dig into the details of the data-driven tools they want to build or deploy, and make sure that teams are considering all the elements of responsible innovation practices. We\u2019ve used the model on policy areas from education to justice to defence, and always found that it uncovers interesting and valuable insights about how to make our data projects better."

Located on the outer ring of the Model, these range from more technical requirements such as safety and security to broader social factors like fairness and societal well-being. By assessing a project against each Fundamental, we can identify where the greatest threats to trustworthiness lie, whether that\u2019s from poor accountability practices or the risk of unfair outcomes."

These are the technical, organisational and environmental factors that must be satisfied in order to meet the Fundamentals. These six categories capture the different types of measures that teams can take to mitigate the ethical risks present in their projects, whether that\u2019s conducting meaningful engagement with stakeholders to uphold transparency or using representative and up-to-date training data to ensure fairness in the decision-making process."
