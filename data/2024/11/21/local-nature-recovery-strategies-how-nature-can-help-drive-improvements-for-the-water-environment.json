One of their biodiversity priorities sets out an ambition to create new freshwater and river buffer habitat and enhance the water quality of their river network. This is underpinned by a number of practical actions that can be delivered in specific locations. This work has built on knowledge developed through wider partnerships such as the Essex Rivers Hub and the Essex Fish Migration Roadmap.\u00a0\u00a0"

Looking across a whole catchment, the team have identified the places where action could be carried out to achieve the most for nature and the wider environment. One of these places is the East Devon Management Catchment which includes the Rivers Exe, Culm, Clyst and Axe. The area is impacted by high levels of nutrients from agricultural runoff and sewage treatment works, and pressure from new housing development. Through LNRS discussions we are exploring this catchment approach to direct where the practical actions should be mapped that will help drive necessary improvements.\u00a0\u00a0"

Working at a landscape scale, this project has identified locations to store carbon in habitats such as peatland, and will help mitigate the impacts of climate change through restoring floodplains -\u00a0 storing more water within the landscape to reduce flooding to communities downstream. An example of natural flood management is the use of leaky dams as shown in the image below.\u00a0"
