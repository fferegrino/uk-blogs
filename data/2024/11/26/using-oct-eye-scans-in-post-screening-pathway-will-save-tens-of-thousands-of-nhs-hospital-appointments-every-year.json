Offering OCT to people in the digital surveillance pathway in England will enable around 60,000 people with diabetes to receive regular advanced scans outside traditional hospital settings. Once rolled out nationwide by October 2025, this will save an estimated 120,000 hospital ophthalmology appointments per year, freeing up vital hospital capacity for patients who are most in need of treatment."
