Often this money is taken away from essential services to deal with the damage caused by waste criminals. Waste crime can endanger people's safety, undercut reputable waste management companies and undermines investment in legitimate businesses."

The feedback was so positive we were invited back to speak again this year. This time to raise awareness of the type and scale of waste crime that we are seeing across England and encourage the waste industry to share what information they know about rogue operators and their waste activities, to help us shut down waste criminals. Building on the success of last year, we also hosted a stand at the event."
