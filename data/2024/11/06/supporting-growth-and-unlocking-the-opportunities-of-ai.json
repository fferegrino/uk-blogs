We know this is a real risk - last year alone, we fined 10 construction firms a total of nearly \u00a360 million across public and private contracts. Now we are digging into how (with better data collection and sharing) AI could detect these illegal practices, helping to reduce public expenditure and save the taxpayer potentially billions of pounds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

We are fully supportive of the important role of the largest firms here - they have driven fantastic progress in this space and are a key source of investment in the UK. It is also our job to enhance and protect opportunities for the challengers \u2013 the start-ups, smaller firms, specialist providers, some of whom have created the most innovative and capable models we have seen so far and many of whom are based here in the UK. There is a role for everyone here - incumbent and challenger, global giants and scrappy start-ups. We would like to see sustained competition supporting this healthy rivalry and tension in the market, benefitting the companies themselves (pushing them to be more innovative, more productive and creative), and ultimately the end users of the products and services.\u00a0"

We have previously highlighted some potential risks to the full benefits of AI being realised by UK consumers and businesses and set about engaging with stakeholders (the largest firms, as well as challengers and startups) on how these might be mitigated. We know heavy-handed, sweeping regulation can stymie innovation and stunt growth, so our approach has been to publish a set of principles to help guide these markets toward positive outcomes. And all of this is supported by our deep in-house capability in technology, data, and AI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
