She had learned wargaming concepts during the Second World War with some of her girlfriends and then taught my father. I didn't really look at wargaming properly until I was about 16 years old. In the beginning it was historical wargaming.\u00a0"

Everything to do with wargaming end to end, basically. I have delivered wargames into business environments, the military, government, and academia in multiple countries.

If you're a researcher and you love data and you love deep diving into things, then data validation and verification of wargaming will appeal. Not everybody has to run a wargame, but facilitation is a key part of it. I think some of the best facilitators are those that are not afraid to create a narrative around things to help the players feel more immersed. In fact, there's some PhDs and studies going on at the moment about immersion and how important that is to get a really good output, so that you're putting yourself into the blue mindset, or indeed red."

And let me tell you, as a wargaming nerd, I never expected this! I think there are diverging thoughts. There are some, let's call them traditional wargamers, who are all about the tabletop and the manual game. Then there are those looking at hybrid; a manual delivery of a wargame but with digital capture of the data. Then there are those that think that digital wargaming is the only way forwards. There are issues with all of them and there are some digital wargames that are really good at what they do for a specific purpose, usually in the tactical space. After the initial question of \u2018does this challenge need a wargame?\u2019, the next question should be \u2018what kind of wargame is fit for purpose?\u2019"

This is because you might only get the players that you need around the table once so let's make sure that any data or information that comes out of it can be easily disseminated, effortlessly shared, and more easily acted upon."

Wargaming can be used for training and education, but also for research and development, business planning, and operational planning (verging on Computer Assisted Exercises). I think there needs to be a bit of a mind shift.A bringing together of digital wisdom, so that we can get the best out of things in that environment because if you want to run wargames rapidly, the only way to do it is with a digital answer. We won\u2019t always have time to design and build a game that's perfect for the idea. Sometimes it might be that we've got an 80% solution with an existing manual game, and we adapt it. I think the rapidity and agility in wargaming needs to speed up."

Rather than people always having to push into our community, it's up to us as a community to reach out and pull people in. What people reading this should do is just join in a wargame, go online, go on to Fight Club International. There's a really good resource there for wargaming primers as well as little videos and it's really accessible. Joining Fight Club is free and gets you into gaming. Readers can even reach out to me and say, look, I'd love to come and play a game. We've got a wargaming studio down in Salisbury that's open 24/7 and you can book to come in and learn how to game."

It\u2019s still a wargame, but it's focused on post-conflict resolution, so don't get hung up on that word \u2018Wargaming\u2019. Serious gaming can look at a variety of different aspects to help in business or in your life."

I was kind of hanging on by my fingertips in wargaming, because I wasn't welcome as a woman in this space, actively prevented from participating, especially as a young civilian woman. I was questioned all the time about my knowledge, abilities, dress (!), and so much more. I don't want that for anybody, but especially not the next generation of talent coming through. We need clever young people to come into this space, so we need to be a safe and happy space for people to be able to come and say \u201cI love it!\u201d."
