Earlier this summer, Amy led a marine planning session for the Whitby Community Group, engaging a range of local stakeholders and including a valuable Q&A session on community views. We are now preparing for our North East marine planning workshop, one of several sessions being held around the country and online. You can sign up here."

During site visits, she visited West Mersea on the Blackwater Estuary to learn about the RSPB Beneficial Use of Dredged Sediment (BUDS) project, which uses sediment from Harwich Harbour Authority to protect eroding islands that support wetland bird species. Marie also joined a site visit to the Eastbourne to Pevensey Bay Coastal Management Scheme, designed to manage the coastline over the next 100 years, reducing flood and erosion risks while benefiting the community and environment."

This provided valuable insights into his role and the critical work of the enforcement team, including fisheries and marine protected area inspections. We also had a chance to refresh our fish identification skills! Charlotte attended a meeting for the Pevensey to Eastbourne Coastal Management Scheme, one of the largest Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Schemes in the country. It was a valuable chance to learn about their approach to managing the 15km coastline and connect with various stakeholders."

The first public consultation is now open, inviting local input on the initial tidal barrage proposals for the River Mersey. We are in the early stages of collaborating with the North West Coastal Group and the Welsh Government to ensure there is alignment between the North West Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) and other policies. The North West SMP, also known as Cell 11, covers the area from Great Orme\u2019s Head in North Wales to the Scottish Border."
