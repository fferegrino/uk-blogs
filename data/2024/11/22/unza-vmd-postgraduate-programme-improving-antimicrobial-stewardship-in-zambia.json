Through the UK Fleming Fund, two MSc students and one PhD student are being sponsored to complete training and research focussed on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), led by academics at UNZA and supported by technical specialists from VMD. The programme has recently expanded to include additional research projects relating to AMR and antimicrobial use in livestock, and residues of veterinary medicines in food products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

They have provided an insight into the development of their projects and the real-world impact they hope their research will have in improving antimicrobial use in livestock in Zambia. It\u2019s exciting to learn about the invaluable work being conducted by these students, aiming to strengthen animal health systems to tackle AMR in a sustainable way."
