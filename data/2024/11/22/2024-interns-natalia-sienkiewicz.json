My internship started by joining Civil Service Live in London - the annual all staff learning conference, where I had the opportunity to meet numerous inspiring people and take part in various sessions which provided me with a deeper understanding of Civil Service work.\u00a0"

            "text": "The internship offers countless learning opportunities, including collaboration with staff members, shadowing professionals from different teams, and various courses on the government learning platform. Even after a few days I could already handle various tasks, like helping with weekly internal newsletters and preparing performance analysis reports. I\u2019ve also helped with preparing an evaluation dashboard for our team to help the team digest key information to then make informed decisions for improvements. In addition to this, I\u2019ve also been getting involved with organising communications campaigns for Government Digital and Data, the brand for the function and profession leading digital transformation. Although it is something that I would not have predicted before for my career, I feel lucky to be part of this experience. My team supports me on every step and gives me freedom to explore different areas of government work too. Due to my interest in data science, I can shadow the data team here at CDDO and help with tasks assigned by them. It\u2019s a great insight and aid in decisions about my future career.\u00a0"

The time I\u2019ve spent at work was enough for me to realise how great is the culture at Civil Service and the impact on people\u2019s lives to deliver modern digital services. It is amazing to be a part of it.\u00a0"
