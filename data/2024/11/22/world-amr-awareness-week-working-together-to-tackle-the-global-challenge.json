            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial agents. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. AMR is one of the most pressing global challenges threatening human health and economic security in the 21st Century. Today, AMR is estimated to be responsible for 1.2 million deaths per year globally, and this is expected to increase significantly by 2050. The threat of AMR is primarily of concern in human healthcare settings, but it is increasingly clear that AMR can develop and spread in the environment, including freshwater and marine environments."

The training was hosted at the National Food Safety Laboratory (NFSL) in Accra, Ghana. The event brought together 14 laboratory scientists from five animal health laboratories and one environmental health laboratory across Ghana. Participants attended from the Accra Veterinary Lab (NFSL), Kumasi Veterinary Lab, Takoradi Veterinary Lab, Dormaa Veterinary Lab, Central Veterinary Lab-Tamale, Ho Veterinary Lab, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Ghana Laboratory in Accra. The training course combined classroom instruction with practical laboratory sessions, providing participants with hands-on experience in handling and testing bacterial cultures. The programme covered essential aspects of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, including quality control and interpretative criteria."
