This requires a suite of legislative reforms. \u00a0As an incredibly complex area of property law, the timing of \u2018switching on\u2019 certain measures in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act is crucial to ensure reforms bring the intended and long-lasting benefits to current leaseholders and future homeowners across the country."
