            "text": "Anyone 13 and over who fishes with a rod and line in freshwater in England and Wales must hold a valid rod licence. This is the law. However, this only tells half the story. When an angler pays for their licence not only are they upholding a legal requirement, they are also investing into a service which maintains, develops and improves freshwater fisheries."

This income was reinvested to directly support angling and fisheries across England by boosting fish stocks, enhancing fishery habitats, providing more safe places to fish, combatting illegal fishing and ensuring a sustainable future for fisheries."

This was done to kick-start the recovery of fisheries after they have recovered from issues such as pollution and environmental incidents or to bolster stocks in conjunction with habitat improvements. This Facebook post from our Great Ouse and Fenland Fisheries team shows how the work of Calverton is benefitting fisheries \ufffc"

            "text": "One of the key areas where fishing licence income makes a real difference to fisheries is through improvement projects. In 2023 to 2024 the Fisheries Improvement Programme (FIP) invested over \u00a3950,000 of licence monies into 232 projects which helped enhance river and stillwater fisheries. These projects directly benefitted over 100,000 anglers. The majority of this work was undertaken with partners such as angling clubs, charities and local rivers trusts and through partnership working this brought in an additional match funding of over \u00a31,000,000."

        {
            "text": "The theme of partnership working runs throughout the report. In 2023 to 2024 the Environment Agency teamed up with over 500 partners demonstrating how combining resources with other organisations made fishing licence income go further and making an\u00a0even greater impact. For example, we work with the Angling Trust, financing activities, carrying out joint enforcement patrols and working with them on projects to encouraging angling."

In 2023 to 2024 our Fisheries Enforcement Officers checked over 46,000 licences which led to 421 prosecutions and \u00a376,485 in penalties. Unlicensed anglers can face fines of up to \u00a32,500."
