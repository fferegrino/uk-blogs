The programme is one of the ways through which evidence of the effectiveness and impact of agri-environment schemes is gathered and delivered.\u00a0Not only do the programme\u2019s findings inform policy development and scheme design, but they also help us to monitor our contribution to government targets. In this guest post, Natural England\u2019s Usha Waygood, Senior Officer in the Evidence Directorate, highlights some of the team\u2019s findings from the report."
