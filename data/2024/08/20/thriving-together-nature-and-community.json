            "text": "At the edge of Barrow-in-Furness, on the north-west coast of England, lies the island of Walney. A wild and windy landscape, it features some nationally rare and important habitats. It is linked to the much larger Morecambe Bay, which has the biggest expanse of intertidal mudflats and sandflats in the UK, and is a key area for many projects in the region."
        },
        {
            "text": "The northern side of Walney Island is home to North Walney National Nature Reserve (NNR). It runs to Earnse Bay, and then to Cumbria Wildlife Trust\u2019s South Walney Nature Reserve at the southern tip of the island. Habitats on the island include sand dunes, dune heath, intertidal mud flats and salt marsh, which attract countless significant species to the area; North Walney NNR is considered one of the best coastal nature reserves in the country, retaining a real sense of wilderness in what is largely an industrial local landscape."

        {
            "text": "The island is an important nesting area, and resting spot, for many key bird species. From wildfowl to waders, many birds use the island each year. It is also home to the nationally endangered natterjack toad, which thrives on the island\u2019s wild terrain, as well as a grey seal colony and the world\u2019s only population of the Walney Island geranium,\u00a0Geranium sanguineum\u00a0var.\u00a0striatum. Alongside this, a large community of people live and work across the surrounding region. Whilst many of them earn good salaries within the nearby shipyard, one in five residents of the Barrow-in-Furness area lives in poverty, with limited interaction with the natural environment. It is this lack of connection that we have sought to overcome, to build a deeper bond between the community and their natural heritage."

We aim to tackle barriers to people\u2019s enjoyment, engagement and connection to the natural world, in line with Government priorities, as set out in the Environmental Improvement Plan. Building our understanding of how and why people face challenges in accessing nature is allowing us to devise projects with local partners to work with communities facing the greatest environmental deprivation, creating more access for all."

The project has been granted initial funding from National Lottery Heritage Fund to develop a 5-year project with the community. The project will help people increase their own feeling of nature connectedness through \u2018pathways to nature\u2019 - activities that engage senses, emotions, appreciation of beauty, and that create personal meaning."

This development phase is focusing on a longer-term project with local communities, listening to their ideas and co-curating the activities that will ignite their passion for the natural wonders at Earnse Bay.\u00a0This project includes elements of Brilliant Barrow, an ambitious programme whose aim is to ensure that Barrow-in-Furness thrives as \u2018a great place to live, work and visit now and into the future\u2019. Under this programme, Westmorland and Furness Council is finalising plans for a community space on Walney Island, part of the Earnse Project. We have been supported further through Defra Capital funding to create a new NNR base, volunteer workshop and beach school, in partnership with the council and Brilliant Barrow programme."

By hosting and promoting a variety of engagement activities, including art-based workshops and volunteering programmes, it is hoped that the community can connect with their local habitat around Morecambe Bay, and with the creatures that have made this stretch of coastline their home."

We want it to be home to a healthy population that can deliver a prosperous, inclusive and fair future. In turn, we will see nature thrive; flourishing together with the community that embraces and celebrates it fully."
