It's great to see departments and arm\u2019s length bodies (ALBs) motoring ahead with its implementation and starting to embed this philosophy across their security practices for digital delivery.

The first group - with ministerial departments, and arm\u2019s length bodies (ALBs) managing Critical National Infrastructure or Top 75 services - is currently in the preparation and piloting stages of implementation. Meanwhile, the second group, consisting of the remaining ALBs, executive agencies, and treasury-funded regulators, will formally join the rollout from January 2025 (although many are already taking proactive steps)."
