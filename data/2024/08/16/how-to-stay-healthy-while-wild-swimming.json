Unlike other areas of water, when open water is designated safe to swim in, it means that sources of pollution are being controlled and reduced to make water quality suitable for bathers."

Also, thoroughly clean any cuts and abrasions to the skin. It is also a good idea to wash your wetsuit or swimsuit with care, and wash your hands again after handling the wetsuit. Allow it to dry out thoroughly to stop any bacteria growing in the wet material before you next use it."

Don\u2019t go swimming again until at least 48 hours after symptoms have stopped, or you might risk passing on the illness to other people using the water."
