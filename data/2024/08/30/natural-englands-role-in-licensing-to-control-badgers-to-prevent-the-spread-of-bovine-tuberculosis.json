The Minister of State for Food Security and Rural Affairs has today (30 August) announced a refresh of the strategy for control of bovine TB and signalled his intention to phase out culling of badgers by the end of the current Parliament."

We look forward to working with government on that refresh in our role as statutory conservation adviser. Badgers are an important (and highly protected) part of England\u2019s wildlife and play a vital role in sustaining functioning ecosystems. We look forward to ensuring disease free badger populations continue to thrive."

This article explains Natural England's role and considerations in re-authorising existing licences, including those recently determined."

Licences are required because badgers are designated by law as a protected species (Protection of Badgers Act 1992). There are three types of culling licence, which are issued by Natural England. Which licence is applicable will depend on the phase of the proposed culling operations and the TB risk area in England concerned:"
