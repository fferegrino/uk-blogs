With deployment accelerating, another 5.13GW is under construction and 17.66GW have been granted consents. To meet our energy security and net zero targets, deployment needs to accelerate even further. The MMOs Strategic Renewable Unit (SRU) are involved in an array of projects to ensure the MMO\u2019s vision of a prosperous future for our seas, coasts and communities is supported through deployment of sustainable offshore wind. Here, we highlight two areas where the SRU are playing an important role in environmental management of offshore wind deployment:"

The SRU collaborates closely with colleagues across government, including Defra, the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED), and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), as well as marine energy infrastructure developers, to manage underwater noise levels in the SNS SAC. There efforts include:"

            "text": "Post-consenting monitoring is a condition of all offshore wind consents, it requires applicants to monitor their environmental impacts throughout the lifetime of their project. This includes impacts on benthic environments, birds, and marine mammals. The SRU is currently undertaking an evidence project focused on standardising the data collection and reporting of post-consent monitoring."

            "text": "Standardisation offers numerous benefits, it makes the process clearer, more robust, and more reliable, it will also enable effective cumulative and in-combination assessments, and improves the functionality of data repositories. This approach may also contribute to strategic monitoring, where a joint approach to monitoring can deliver programmes of a greater scale and scope, providing a greater understanding of ecological impacts, sensitivity or recovery."

Their approach involves identifying receptors and current monitoring approaches, liaising with our marine licensing team, interested stakeholders, advisors and agencies to develop a template for post-consent monitoring standards and implement them through licensing conditions."
