We discuss implementation challenges of privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) - specifically, the areas of threat modeling and real-world deployments."

            "text": "In research on privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL), the protections of a PPFL system are usually encoded in a threat model that defines what kinds of attackers the system can defend against. Some systems assume that attackers will eavesdrop on the system\u2019s operation, but won\u2019t be able to affect its operation (a so-called honest but curious attacker), while others assume that attackers may modify or break the system\u2019s operation (an active or fully malicious attacker). Weaker attackers are generally easier to defend against than stronger ones."

Or somewhere in between? It\u2019s often very difficult to say with confidence\u2014and making the wrong choice may result in deployment of a system that is not sufficiently well-defended. Moreover, it can be difficult even to compare different threat models to determine their relative strength."

For example, an attacker can eavesdrop on communications between agents and use the observations to figure out the secrets, e.g., reconstruct the global model. Another attacker may tamper with the labels of a local dataset to induce erroneous predictions. A local agent can also be an attacker, in the sense that they can inject backdoors into the global model or steal the global model without contribution. An attacker to the central agent can manipulate the model update to prevent the global model from converging."

These gaps between theory and practice remain a barrier to developing deployable PPFL systems, and most existing systems have filled these gaps with custom solutions. In addition to limiting the potential for PPFL systems to be adoptable on a wider scale, this approach also means that it\u2019s difficult to ensure that deployed PPFL systems are reliable and free of bugs. This challenge is compounded by the need for real-world PPFL systems to integrate with existing data infrastructure\u2014a requirement that can also lead to important security and privacy problems. Several participants in the UK-US PETs Prize Challenges highlighted issues relating to this."

For example, it may not consider the cases where some or all local agents do not have sufficient computational powers or memory to conduct large scale training and inference, it may not consider the open environment in which there are eavesdropper or attacker to compromise security or privacy properties of the algorithms, etc."

These flaws typically arise because solution designers often seek to retro-fit existing legacy solutions or systems to add privacy-preserving elements as a time and cost-saving measure. The net result is that the overall system becomes poorly optimised for privacy protection, since in many cases an optimal solution may necessitate starting from scratch which can be prohibitively expensive from a development perspective. Privacy-by-design means building privacy protections into a system \u201con paper and in practice\u201d, i.e. both designing a system to be privacy-preserving from the ground up and testing the entire system to ensure those privacy protections are having the desired effect."
