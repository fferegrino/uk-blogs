In this blog, two members of the Grants Service team write about their experience attending shows. "

But it\u2019s not just farmers and agents - networking is a big part of being on the RPA stand. We mainly share the stand with Defra when we attend shows and it\u2019s good listening to them, as I\u2019ve learnt so much. At some shows we also share the stand with Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) which brings more opportunity to network and learn."

Most of the time they want know what\u2019s going on with their application, when a new scheme is coming out or when they\u2019ll be getting paid. That\u2019s what we\u2019re there for - to help and guide. What\u2019s really lovely is when people visit the stand to just sit and have a chat."

            "text": "The shows also give us the opportunity to be able to look around and see the different types of machinery we fund, getting to know a bit more about them and how they help farmers. A number of shows we attend have plenty of farm animals - from highland cows, Valais Blacknose sheep and sheep dog pups. Seeing and learning about the different types of breeds shows how farmers are diversifying from just having a dairy herd to also breeding a rare breed of cattle, sheep or even alpacas.\u201d"

I\u2019ve found that representing RPA at shows has helped me to really understand how the work we do has an impact on grant applicants, and it\u2019s also a great way to better understand farmers and their needs, as well as the issues they face.\u201d"

            "text": "Visiting our stand at an event is often the only face-to-face contact people have with RPA, and for us, being able to meet farmers and agents provides unique feedback which influences the way we write guidance and design processes. It\u2019s also a chance for us to gain some early insight into how you feel about our existing and future schemes, so If you\u2019re attending any shows and events, during the rest of the year come and have a conversation with us."
