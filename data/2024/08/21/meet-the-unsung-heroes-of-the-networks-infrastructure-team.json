Although the name has changed, the service we deliver has remained consistent. I even met my husband through the MoJ, as we worked in the same office for a time.

My father was a public servant in my hometown, and his dedication inspired me to pursue a role in public service. I wanted to contribute to society and make a real difference through my work."
