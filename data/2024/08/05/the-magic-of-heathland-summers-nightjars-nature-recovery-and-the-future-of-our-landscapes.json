            "text": "Historically, heathlands have been impacted by people using the products of the land to live. This led to a complex mosaic of open dry and wet heath, acidic grassland, regenerating woodland, and scrubby heath. With the industrial evolution came a rise in intensive agriculture and urban development, which has caused an 80% decline in heathlands since 1800s."

Heathlands Connections aims to create a connected landscape, by reconnecting fragmented habitats, enhancing climate resilience, and promoting responsible enjoyment of natural areas. The purpose is to support nature recovery, strengthen existing habitats, and boost biodiversity."

I was volunteering as a brownie, helping with winter scrub removal. It was a freezing cold day, and I spent what felt like hours pulling up sapling pine trees. What struck me most about these special habitats was the sense of openness and tranquillity. It felt magical to be there. I have been lucky to live locally to heathlands, either in Surrey or down in Dorset."

            "text": "The name gives a big clue. This project connects people with nature, connects the landscape, connects the heathlands with the goal of creating a bigger, better and joined up landscape. Connectivity is vital. To thrive, wildlife needs space to move freely and access what is needed to survive. Habitats in isolation do not help to recover nature."

These efforts mimic historical land management practices and large herbivore grazing, which help the heathlands to thrive."

They wonder if the long winter months of hard work\u2014clearing scrub in the rain and cold\u2014have paid off. As darkness falls, the excitement peaks, for it is time for a summer Nightjar Survey. The nightjar, a captivating bird species with a unique call, is a highlight of the heathlands. These migratory birds, arriving from sub-Saharan Africa in spring, require open, heathy areas to nest on the ground. Will the hard winter work creating this habitat have paid off?"

Historically, these birds were surrounded by myths, including the superstition that they used their wide mouths to suck milk from goats, earning them the nickname 'goatsuckers.' Their scientific name, Caprimulgus, reflects this old superstition (Capri \u2013 \u2018goat\u2019, mulgus - \u2018to milk\u2019)."

            "text": "Nightjars are indicators of the overall health of the ecosystem and our progress towards species abundance. They are one of many rare species and can help us understand the diversity and condition of their surroundings. For me, their arrival heralds the start of summer and the anticipation of the heathlands coming alive."
