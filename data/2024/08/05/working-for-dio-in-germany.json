This includes land management for NATO Forward Holding Base Sennelager (NFS), which includes Ayrshire Barracks near Monchengladbach, all isolated detachment housing requirements for the UK military and their families assigned to the various NATO locations around Germany and oversight of adventurous training lodges in Bavaria and the Harz mountains; it's a role I have held since Nov 2021."

            "text": "I have a land agency background which is helpful as the work is split evenly between managing the UK\u2019s military training areas and acquisition and management of residential and some commercial hirings throughout Germany. I have worked previously on MOD ranges in the UK and overseas in Cyprus, the latter managing a small team of locally employed civilians who deliver on a day-to-day basis; similar to the arrangement in Germany."

The Ramstein office also covers the Bavarian Alpine Training Lodges and their associated support staff who are located in Oberstdorf, Wertach, Sonthofen, and Bad Hindelang."

Sennelager lies on the northwestern outskirts of Paderborn which is a typical German market town with all the facilities you could wish for shops, social, sport and leisure. Well known for its excellent Christmas markets!"

A train station just outside the entrance to the camp provides excellent access to Paderborn or Bielefeld mainline stations from which DB intercity trains access the whole of Europe."

I also field issues that fall out from our European Support Group (ESG) accommodation colleagues who are based in Mons, Belgium who are tasked with providing accommodation to service personnel posted throughout Germany and wider Europe which we acquire and deal with all Ld/Tt communication."
