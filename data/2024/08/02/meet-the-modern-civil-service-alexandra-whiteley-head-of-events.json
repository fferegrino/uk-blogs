It\u2019s about making sure our civil servants have the skills, training and development they need to be able to deliver world class public services, and that we are supporting them to try new approaches and have the space to grasp the opportunities that new technologies offer us. Civil servants are constantly striving to continually improve on our delivery - trying new things, sharing what works and best practices, and collaborating. It\u2019s about making the most of the incredible breadth of knowledge and skills we have access to as within the organisation. I think it\u2019s also about learning from the likes of other governments, or public service providers \u2014 both internationally and within the UK \u2014 but really importantly, through our partnerships with the private sector.\u00a0"

I worked in Welsh Government and Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales in broader comms roles before focusing in on events. I\u2019ve worked as Head of Events in HMRC, supporting their leadership events and offering a consultation service to wider business units on how to deliver events, before moving to Cabinet Office in 2016 to start heading up Civil Service Live. A couple of\u00a0 years ago, I started working on Cabinet Office events too."

            "text": "I really enjoyed doing broad comms roles early on in my career to get a good feel for what interested me and what I excelled at, so I\u2019d encourage people to try a number of roles before specialising in a certain area. Whilst I didn\u2019t take that route \u2014 I think the Fast Stream is an incredible way to do that \u2014 I\u2019d encourage existing civil servants to apply for a place if possible. You get such a breadth of understanding and lots of tailored learning and advice to support your development. That would be my advice to new civil servants: move around and get a feel for what you like."

I like the fact you have a really tangible end product for all of the hard work you\u2019ve put into planning and organising an event. In terms of what I think is exciting - the event days themselves are always high stress and high energy. You need to have a lot of trust in different groups of people to deliver \u2014 from the speakers to the volunteers, to the audio/ visual team to the exhibition build partner, to the venue staff and security. I really enjoy troubleshooting issues on the day and quickly finding solutions to ensure that from the delegates\u2019 perspective it\u2019s a smooth and seamless operation.\u00a0"

            "text": "Before you get started, you need to think about what behaviour change you are trying to achieve by communicating your content via an event. I spend a lot of time asking people to think about \u2018what will the delegate do differently as a result of the information you are sharing?\u2019 because you need a clear objective and result.\u00a0\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "You need to think about how to make the content engaging, empowering and educational: are you sharing information and new ideas that change thinking and allow them to learn new skills and innovate? Are you allowing them time to discuss this with other members of the audience? And are you setting up an opportunity for two way dialogue between your speaker and your audience member so it\u2019s a chance to share information on a two way exchange and not just a broadcast approach. The Government Communication Service OASIS comms model is a great way to identify how to plan your event and really neatly guides you through the objectives, and Audience, Strategy, Insight and Scoring approach.\u00a0"

A few years ago, Covid also meant we had to pivot from a face-to-face event to deliver a fully online event in a matter of days. There are always going to be obstacles to overcome and you need to have really strong plans in place to manage as many of the aspects as you can. It helped to set up a really robust risk register to set out your approach and mitigations to the issues that might come up, but ultimately, it\u2019s the team around me that are the crucial factor in this.\u00a0"

It\u2019s really motivating to receive feedback from delegates who now perhaps understand more about how their role fits into the wider Civil Service, to learn they built connections across the Civil Service, or that they had a career conversation at one of our spot mentoring sessions which led to them exploring\u00a0 new career path or having the renewed confidence to apply for promotion.\u00a0"

Each of those small changes can have a huge impact on public services when you think over 20,000 staff came along to this year\u2019s events. Whether it\u2019s making people better at making an impact with their writing, understanding the skills they need to embrace AI, drafting effective strategies, or being more effective leaders, there are a huge range of skills, knowledge and approaches that the Civil Service excels at.
