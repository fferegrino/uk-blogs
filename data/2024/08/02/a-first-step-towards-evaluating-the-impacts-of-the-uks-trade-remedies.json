For example, a UK trade remedy measure on red roses imported from Roseland (which become relatively more expensive) could lead to consumers and retailers buying more red roses from the UK (which become relatively less expensive). This measure could also lead to consumers and retailers buying more white roses from the UK or white roses imported from Roseland (because white roses are now a relatively less expensive substitute for red roses). These changes in decisions of consumers and decisions of firms are likely to have economic and social impacts. Policy makers should, as a matter of good practice, try to learn early on about the impact that their interventions have on the population.\u00a0"

The report considers the key econometric methodologies, which are often used in causal impact analysis: gravity models, difference-in-difference (diff-in-diff), synthetic control method (SCM), Bayesian methods (BCI), and event studies. The report also considers simple analytical methods (which could be used when data is not readily available, or when time and/or resources are limited) such as before-during-after analysis (where variables of interest are compared before and after the imposition of a trade remedy), or trend analysis (which investigates changes in variables over time and examines changes in trajectories and fluctuations). The report also shows how economic theory and economic models could be used in evaluation.\u00a0"

The guiding framework is not intended to be read as \u2018prescriptive\u2019 and \u2018must-follow\u2019 but instead it gives an indication of what are the most suitable methodological tools to use in our evaluation when certain conditions are and/or are not met.\u00a0"

A good methodology toolkit and good data are both instrumental to delivering a high-quality evaluation, where the analysis and the final conclusions are robust, well-balanced, and made from varied evidence and perspectives. Given the constantly changing economic landscape, including economic shocks, this adds complexity to our task of evaluation of the true causal impact of trade remedy measures."
