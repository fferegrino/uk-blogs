The report also shows that globally only Japan has a higher number of companies with such a target, at 768 at the end of 2023 compared to the UK\u2019s 693."

To do this, they can buy credits from Woodland Carbon Code or Peatland Code projects, with one credit from either Code equivalent to one tonne of carbon. But how much does a tonne of carbon cost? \u00a35 per tonne? \u00a325? \u00a3100?\u00a0 And how do you know if that\u2019s a fair price?"

With no set price, it\u2019s difficult to know where to go to find more information and, until last year, no UK pricing data was officially collected and reported on."

The results show that the average price of carbon from Woodland Carbon Code projects has been rising in recent years, averaging around \u00a325 per tonne in 2023. This is significantly higher than the global average, at around USD 7 per tonne in 2023."

To some buyers, location of a woodland creation or peatland restoration project could be important and valuable, choosing to buy from projects close to their business operations to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. When planning to offset future emissions, buyers have to consider the credit\u2019s vintage \u2013 the date when a Pending Issuance Unit is expected to be converted into a Woodland Carbon Unit or Peatland Carbon Unit, indicating when the offset claim can be made. Delivering well on additional benefits such as biodiversity or water quality may also help sellers to market their units more effectively to buyers who value these things. Understanding the many factors that affect carbon pricing could help landowners place themselves more effectively in the market."

Buyers too can benefit from this evidence that can be factored into decision-making and support business planning. It may also support the development of carbon codes for other natural habitats that sequester carbon, giving both landowners and buyers more choice about the kinds of nature-based solutions that they want to support."
