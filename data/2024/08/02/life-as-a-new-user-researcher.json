            "text": "If you\u2019d asked me at the beginning of last year what user research was, I probably could not have told you. I had conducted original research for my Masters degree and I knew a career in research was something that I wanted to pursue, but user research was not on my radar."

            "text": "Coming across user research happened completely by chance. I stumbled across a YouTube video of someone presenting their portfolio. I was immediately hooked and the concept really appealed to me."

            "text": "The idea of speaking to people to understand their experiences and difficulties when using a product or service was a refreshing change from other styles of research."

        {
            "text": "So I signed up to all the newsletters and blogs I could find and tried to learn as much as I could about the field. Eventually, I saw the user research role at ICS Digital come up on Civil Service Jobs and jumped at the chance to apply."

            "text": "Once you\u2019re in, you really do learn by doing. Starting my first project felt quite daunting but I have never learnt as much as I did during those first few weeks. Everyone has their niche and something that they really enjoy doing while researching. To my surprise, shortly after starting my first project, I discovered I really enjoy interviewing."

            "text": "Once the research is under way you\u2019ll find yourself becoming a bit of an expert, quite often in fields you never thought you would be! Since joining the ICS user research team, I have gathered knowledge on heat networks, energy efficiency funding schemes and much more!"

            "text": "At the end of interviewing, we analyse all notes and pull out all the common themes and pain points.\u00a0 This helps others in the UCD team adapt what they\u2019re doing so that they can make improvements or change direction if something really doesn\u2019t work."

            "text": "This means that, even if only a few participants do reply to your invites, you shouldn\u2019t let that detract from the insights you can gather from these sessions. A handful of really rich interviews can be all you need to develop a good grasp of the problem and understand what people need from your service."
