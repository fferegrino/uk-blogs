            "text": "New life has been breathed into Buckinghamshire\u2019s Hamble Brook by a substantial wetland site spanning 2,500 square metres. This work, led by the Chilterns Chalk Streams Project, further extends the largest scheme of its kind involving the Environment Agency, and aims to restore the chalk stream to its natural state. The Hamble Brook is a rare winterbourne (meaning it only flows periodically) that joins the Thames at Hambleden Lock. Its natural function and ecology have been compromised over the years due to agricultural cultivation and ornamental landscaping, but this project seeks to restore a range of habitats and ecosystems not seen in over 140 years."

            "text": "This latest stage of the project added a new wildlife habitat. Working with the natural contours of the landscape, the partnership created lowered areas that will get wet sooner and stay wetter for longer. During high-water periods, this is valuable habitat for birds, insects, amphibians and small mammals, but will also provide refuges when the channel enters its next drying phase."

            "text": "Chalk streams are globally scarce and unique ecosystems. In the Chilterns, there are 9 major chalk streams, each of which has played an important role in shaping our cultural heritage. They are all under threat and require a combination of education and direct intervention to ensure their long-term survival."

Woody material and gravel has been used to restore variety into the channel, backwaters have been created, two groundwater-fed ponds enhanced, and native saplings planted to create shade and wildlife corridors."
