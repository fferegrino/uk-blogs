The session focused on the implications of the increasing activities at sea, in particular noise generated. Participants worked collaboratively and strategically within a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) to manage their allocated \u2018noise budget\u2019 and ensure it was not exceeded. Feedback indicated that the game enhanced participants understanding of marine planning and helped them draw relevant parallels with their own work."

They presented our approach to monitoring marine plans at the annual conference and authored a section of the South West Marine Ecosystems report. The report outlines the MMO\u2019s work during 2023, including a breakdown of marine license applications and wildlife licenses, insights into how indicators are utilized to measure the effectiveness of marine plans, and a summary of the Marine Plan Monitoring Surveys in the South West. If you missed the webinar and want to know more about our monitoring process, you can watch it here."

She has been in discussions with Sefton Council to examine the policies in the North West Marine Plans and comparing them with policies in the Shoreline Management Plan. Making this comparative analysis ensures alignment in policy intent and direction, and thereby informing future Local Plan policies."
