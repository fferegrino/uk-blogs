            "text": "I created an external survey to send out to customers to understand their experiences. I also created an internal survey for colleagues in Grants Service who work on phone and email helplines for insight on the feedback they\u2019ve received. When we sent out the external survey we asked if we could contact people directly, so I\u2019ve spoken with a number of farmers to hear more about their responses."

By getting their feedback on their experience of the service, Grants Service will be able to understand the positive aspects as well as pinch points. This feedback will help improve the service which will make customers\u2019 lives easier."

I\u2019ve had the opportunity to attend both RPA\u2019s and Defra\u2019s executive committee meetings which has given me insight into what the areas of work they cover."

They\u2019ve examined my work and suggested changes, as well as helping me to get into contact with the right people. I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to meet new people in different areas of RPA and understanding the effect grants have on farmers."

            "text": "I\u2019m really enjoying my internship and it\u2019s been invaluable in helping me understand how the Civil Service works. It\u2019s been a great experience making connections with people and taking advantage of as many opportunities as possible. The allocations for departments in the internship are randomised, and the RPA is not something I would necessarily have thought about, but it really is amazing to see how much support there is for farmers."
