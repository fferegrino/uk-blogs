NESAC is seeking to appoint new members from across the scientific community. As a member of the Committee, you would normally be expected to serve for at least 3 years, attending 4 meetings per year. In addition, members will have the opportunity to attend and contribute to relevant Natural England events, such as NESAC Science Seminars, Natural England Science to Delivery conferences and workshops. Please note, these posts are not salaried but Natural England will reimburse appropriate travel costs. Our governance pages provide more information on this."
