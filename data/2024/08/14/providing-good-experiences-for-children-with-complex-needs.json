The report was based on a national survey of local authorities and children\u2019s home providers across England to help us understand the extent of the difficulties they have when finding homes for children with these needs, and the barriers homes face in accepting them. We also carried out 10 case studies to identify good practice among local authorities and children\u2019s homes, as well as the barriers they face and how practice could improve."

These are typically children with severe mental health difficulties, or whose needs can manifest in behaviours that place the child or others at risk."

When all the necessary information about a child\u2019s needs is available to all relevant parties, decision-makers can tell whether a home will be a good fit. Joint working was also necessary to create bespoke placements targeted at a child\u2019s individual needs."

Where we saw this done well, it was because the child\u2019s preferences led the transition process."

This is especially true for children with complex needs, as they often live in homes outside their original local authority and are some of those most in need of mental health support. Through the case studies, we saw various ways that children\u2019s home staff were helping children to access mental health services."

This removes uncertainty for them and helps them to feel more invested in making a placement work and seeing where they live as their home. The relationships children had with staff were also crucial in making them feel at home and like they belong. When staffing was consistent, this benefited relationships. But, most importantly, children\u2019s sense of belonging was strengthened when staff were able to demonstrate their commitment to children."
