The rules for these qualifications have changed, so most of these qualifications are different from previous versions in several ways. For example, students must now take the external assessment at the end of their course, and the approach to marking and grading many internal assessments has changed. Many awarding organisations have taken the opportunity to update and refresh the content of their qualifications, and some are using a different grading scale too. The number of Tech Award qualifications available has also significantly decreased this year, although the number of entries overall remains high."

We have asked awarding organisations to take into account that teachers and students may be less familiar with the new assessments when setting grade boundaries for new Tech Awards. However, it is important that these new qualifications are robust, and that students have demonstrated the skills, knowledge and understanding appropriate for each grade. This approach has been used for other new qualifications previously.\u00a0 \u00a0"
