The scheme enables individuals to volunteer accommodation and provide a route to temporary sanctuary for Ukrainians.

There\u2019s a clear collective understanding of the need to work transparently, to uproot issues early, and to iterate and grow from a firm foundation of understanding user needs. Teams are structured in the ways outlined in the GOV.UK Service Manual, and agile principles are applied consistently, bringing a mutual understanding and an ability to proactively respond to events and address challenges.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
