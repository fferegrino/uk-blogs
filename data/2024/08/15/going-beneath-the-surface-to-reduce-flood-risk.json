The Grand Sluice was built over 250 years ago to prevent tidal water entering the Lower Witham. It\u2019s been refurbished a number of times during its working life, most recently in the 1980s, and is now due for another upgrade in the next few years."

            "text": "Sonar surveys, lidar scans and 3d modelling are a key part of the work we do and can help us look at things in different ways. For example, sonar studies and lidar have been used at Grand Sluice to help build a full 3d model of the sluice, river bed and channel sides. This work is then supplemented by the dive surveys. Having a physical specialist in the water allows the EA to learn more about certain details that a sonar can\u2019t provide. A diver can test with their hands whether mortar is in good condition unlike a model, and they can also take samples from structures and investigate crevices that might not be seen remotely."

These examples are just some of the ways that divers specialist skills can be a real benefit to the management of our assets and we\u2019ll look to build on these in the future."
