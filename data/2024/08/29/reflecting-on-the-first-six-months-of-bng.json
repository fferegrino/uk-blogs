We have supported Defra since 2018 by engaging with stakeholders to collaboratively produce and refine this policy. Now that BNG is being delivered through legislation, we have started our role in managing the publicly accessible biodiversity gain site register and statutory biodiversity credit sales service, as delegated by Defra."

New habitat banks, BNG brokers, software tools and on-line market places have emerged as creative solutions to the new ambition for nature recovery embedded in BNG. Nearly 500 sites are being advertised across several digital marketplaces, with a majority of those sites being listed as ready, or nearly ready, to register their sites on the biodiversity gain site register."

If this habitat is delivered off-site, it must be recorded on the BNG Register. The purpose of the Register is to provide a publicly accessible record of off-site gains and the developments they are enabling. It aims to enable strategic planning and prevent the double counting of biodiversity units."

Since then, a total of 11 gain sites have been registered, securing more than 250 hectares and 7.5 km of planned habitat intervention. Most of this habitat enhancement and creation is being provided through grassland, broadleaved forests and floodplain wetland mosaic habitats. For a full breakdown of registered gain sites, you can search the Biodiversity gain sites register (data.gov.uk)."

Statutory biodiversity credits are available if on-site and off-site options are not possible. Local Planning Authorities decide whether a developer can buy statutory credits as part of the planning process. These statutory credits are available to buy only once planning permission has been granted and other options have been exhausted."
