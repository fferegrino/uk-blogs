I\u2019m very lucky that I get to spend my time meeting people from across government and showcasing the wonderful work that happens in the Operational Delivery Profession (ODP). The ODP runs a variety of events every year including our annual awards ceremony where we celebrate and recognise the achievements of our civil servants working in operational delivery, ODP Fest, our three-week virtual learning festival, and our participation in Civil Service Live.\u00a0"

Whether it\u2019s an in-person conference for 300 people or an online meeting for 15, there are some basic things which all events have in common. If you can crack these essentials, everything else will fall into place."
