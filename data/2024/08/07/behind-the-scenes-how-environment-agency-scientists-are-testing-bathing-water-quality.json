The Environment Agency is responsible for monitoring, improving, and maintaining water quality at all designated bathing waters. Importantly, designation also means that information is provided to the public to help inform decisions on where and when to bathe. Here, Environment Agency scientist Emily Egglestone explains how a bathing water sample is tested to see how clean it is.\u202f\u00a0"

The water is kept in sterile bottles that are either 500ml or a litre in volume and are kept refrigerated until their arrival at the lab.\u00a0 The sample registration team arrive at about 6am each morning to register the samples so that the scientists can start their analysis at 7am.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "A certain volume of each sample is put through a filter paper. This lets the water pass through but captures the bacteria. The filter paper is then put onto specific growth media and incubated to allow the bacteria to grow. E. coli is incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 hours followed by 44\u00b0C for 24 hours whereas intestinal enterococci take longer, it is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours and then 44\u00b0C for 48 hours. The lower starting temperature encourages the bacteria to grow and the higher temperature is more selective, promoting the growth of faecal gut bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

If E. coli is present in the sample, the plates will have blue-green colonies growing on them. We count those colonies and calculate how many were in the original sample. It is a similar process for the intestinal enterococci test, but these plates produce red colonies and the results are obtained 48 hours after filtration. The results then require further confirmation which takes the whole process to 72 hours. We report the results immediately so action can be taken to put in place the appropriate pollution prevention measures.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

River samples do tend to have higher concentrations of bacteria than coastal waters. Rivers are closer to sources of bacteria than the sea, and don\u2019t have the benefit of dilution that occurs by the time bacteria reach the sea.\u00a0"

Examples of DNA we can detect are human, dog, birds or cows and sheep. This information can help investigators to get to the root cause of the issue and take action. Our data is used to put in place local action plans with partners to address pollution and can provide the public with vital information as to the cleanliness of bathing waters.\u00a0\u00a0"

You can also review whether a bathing water is classed as Excellent, Good, Sufficient or Poor.\u202f Samples tested by us throughout the bathing season are used to produce an annual bathing water classification.
