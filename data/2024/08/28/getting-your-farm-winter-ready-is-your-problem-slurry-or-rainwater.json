They also need maintenance, but that needn\u2019t be expensive if properly planned. There are also which can help improve yard drainage. Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) may be able to provide you with further advice."

Imagine your yards and silage clamps acting like a series of Olympic sized swimming pools collecting rainfall! Roofing a silage pit (given that the rainfall that drains from it will be classed\u00a0 silage effluent) and making it SSAFO compliant (grants are available through CSF) is one solution. In the example above the farmer decided to switch from clamp to baled silage (photo 4) to prioritise sorting out gutters and drains and manage cash flow. It meant less pressure and volume of \u2018slurry\u2019 to collect."
