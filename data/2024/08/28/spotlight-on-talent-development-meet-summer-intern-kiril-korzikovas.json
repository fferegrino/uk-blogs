            "text": "I remembered hearing about the scheme years ago when I was in sixth form. I wanted to apply because I\u2019ve always been interested in working for the government so the opportunity to gain hands-on experience of this before I finish my degree would be really beneficial in working towards this goal."

            "text": "I also found that upon successful completion of the scheme you earn a \u201cfast pass\u201d which fast tracks your application to the Civil Service Fast Stream. I\u2019d like to join the Fast Stream when I graduate so this opportunity to progress my application ahead of my final year of university will help to take some of the pressure off during what I\u2019m sure will be a busy year!"

            "text": "The application process wasn\u2019t as scary as I anticipated. You complete three online tests \u2013 a situational judgement test, a workplace judgement test and a numeracy test.\u00a0If you pass the tests, you then get invited to a telephone interview and then if you\u2019re successful at interview you get offered a place on the scheme."
        },
        {
            "text": "The telephone interview was probably part I was most worried about. However, when I was doing the interview, it was really relaxed \u2013 the interviewer wants you to do your best and will guide you throughout the interview to give you the opportunity to do this rather than trying to \u2018catch you out\u2019."

            "text": "In my role within DDTS, I\u2019ve been working closely with the project management office, so I\u2019ve learned a lot about project management and everything that goes into that. I\u2019ve spent time attending meetings with different colleagues, from senior managers to portfolio analysts and done a lot of data analysis, report writing and helping prepare presentations. There are of course some admin tasks to do but the focus is definitely on getting you involved with things that help you learn and develop your skills."

It\u2019s definitely helped me learn about corporate etiquette and develop my soft skills too."
