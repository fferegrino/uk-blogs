The sewerage network has storm overflows that act as safety valves to reduce the risk of this happening. There are strict permit conditions for when and how they should be used to protect the environment, and it is the responsibility of water companies to comply with the law and to avoid polluting the environment. They must act quickly to address failures and reduce damage if it occurs or face potential enforcement action.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Inspections will rise significantly, and we will carry out 4,000 by the end of March 2025; 10,000 in 2025/26 and 11,500 in 2026/27. Key to increasing our regulatory capabilities is our digital innovation and transformation. Through the new tools we are already developing, we are improving our ability to turn data rapidly into regulatory intelligence so that we can more easily identify the highest priority issues, meaning our officers can spend more time regulating water companies.\u00a0"
