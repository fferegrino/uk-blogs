But, for many families across the UK, buying school uniforms is a significant and unavoidable cost alongside the additional costs of childcare and entertainment during the summer holidays. So as a governing body or head of school, what things do you need to keep in mind when it comes to your school\u2019s uniform policy?"

For example, some families are forced to buy what they consider to be unnecessarily branded items of school uniform, often from suppliers and retailers who have exclusivity agreements with particular schools."

You should therefore at least be thinking about cost as part of your considerations when setting a school uniform policy. The Scottish Government will shortly be introducing similar guidance while the Department of Education in Northern Ireland is currently consulting on revising its guidance. At the CMA, we\u2019ve worked closely with the governments of all 4 nations to help shape their guidance."
