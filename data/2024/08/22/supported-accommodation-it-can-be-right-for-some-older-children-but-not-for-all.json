From time to time, all 16- and 17-year-olds will need elements of help similar to the type of care that is more typically provided by a children\u2019s home or by foster carers. If supported accommodation providers offer that kind of sensitive help (usually short-term in nature and responding to a specific need), they will not usually be straying outside the scope of their registration. We expect providers to be able to respond flexibly to children\u2019s changing needs as they develop life skills for future adulthood."

These terms are unhelpful and misleading. They can mask what is actually being commissioned or provided. In some cases, it means that providers are operating unregistered children\u2019s homes and that children are not getting the care they need from people who are suitably skilled and qualified."

The high (and growing) number of 16- and 17-year-olds in supported accommodation should give us all cause for concern that, as a result of gaps in provision elsewhere, too many children are being pushed towards an independence for which they are not properly prepared."
