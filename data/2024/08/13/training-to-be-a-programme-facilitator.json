We spoke with two programme facilitators, Simone and Craig who bring different experiences of the role. Simone joined the Probation Service two years ago and came from a criminal justice background, having previously worked in the Prison Service. Craig has worked in the role for seven years and brought his experience of working with students with behavioural difficulties. From initial training to the nuances of working with diverse groups, Simone and Craig give us an insight into being a programme facilitator and how they can help change offending behaviours.\u00a0\u00a0"

I enjoyed that kind of coaching element of the role and that was a good crossover into the programme facilitator role.\u00a0"

I could be on a night shift and would talk to offenders about what they were going through and what had led them to make certain decisions. I was trying to make a difference and trying to support people through making different decisions and I can really put this into practice in my current job.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The programme aims to help offenders gain a better understanding of the impact of their behaviour and promotes techniques of emotional self-control. The programme runs for 30 sessions, including both group and one-to-one sessions. TSP is geared towards general offending behaviours, covering self-management, problem-solving, and social interactions. Offenders will learn to develop skills like emotional control and assessment of positive and negative influences in their lives. TSP runs for 19 sessions with groups of up to 12 people.\u00a0\u00a0"

This not only helped in understanding the practical aspects of delivering the programmes but also in building rapport within our team. The core skills training laid a strong foundation by teaching us essential techniques like motivational interviewing. These skills are crucial in engaging participants and steering conversations towards productive outcomes. We have one-to-one meetings with each offender before they start a programme to develop conditions of success, creating an environment where everyone is open, honest, and willing to learn.\u00a0"
