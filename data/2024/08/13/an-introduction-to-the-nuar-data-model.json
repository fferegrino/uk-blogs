Having a standardised data model as a target provides us for the first time with a framework for reporting on elements of data quality \u2013 such as completeness, consistency of representation, availability of metadata \u2013 in a consistent manner across different organisations, sectors and geographies. This presents huge opportunities for identification and discussion of areas that might benefit from scrutiny and targeted action to move the dial on data quality improvement.\u00a0"
