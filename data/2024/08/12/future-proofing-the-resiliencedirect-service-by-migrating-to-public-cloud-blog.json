            "text": "ResilienceDirect consisted of five applications. Three of these, Collaborate, Maps and Joint Operational Learning, are central for core users. These platform applications were hosted in a private cloud network controlled by a single hosting provider. This set up was not ideal for a web platform that has by its nature a wide range of fluctuation in usage since an emergency can happen at any time. Moreover, the applications are provided and operated by four different partners, as a result, there were additional operational costs in having to coordinate work between the different suppliers. "

            "text": "Hence, in September 2023, the two teams, CO Digital and Resilience, came together for a programme of phased service transformation. They reviewed the live service\u2019s technology and supplier landscape, considered a range of options for improving it and made the case for investment. They subsequently produced a hosting migration design that was approved by the Cabinet Office Technical Design Authority in February and started work on phase one. "

        {
            "text": "For phase one, the four-person delivery team (two full time and two part time) worked in an Agile way to prioritise the modernisation of the hosting infrastructure. This would stabilise the platform and prepare the way for a subsequent phase of work dedicated to building a user-centric service by improving its design and accessibility in compliance with the government digital Service Standard. Focusing on migration first would also remove the need to maintain dual hosting infrastructure for any extended period. "

            "text": "The entire hosting migration ran at a high pace and was completed ahead of time in mid-March 2024. By using cloud native tools and right-sizing hosting maintenance and support resources, the team has already delivered a saving of roughly \u00a330,000 per month (a 42 percent cost reduction per year). The new supplier also provides an ongoing service to optimise the infrastructure which will deliver further savings and it includes enhanced security and application monitoring.1"

By migrating to the public cloud, the team has not only enhanced scalability and flexibility but also made the potential to iterate the technology available for the future. With platform resilience now in place, the next phase towards enhancing the user journey and service design has already started and will complete the transformation towards an improved event and emergency response service for all the resilience community."
