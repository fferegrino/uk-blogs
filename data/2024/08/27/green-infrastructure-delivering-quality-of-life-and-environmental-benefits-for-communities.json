GI helps local authorities, communities and developers create better places for people to live, work, learn and relax."

            "text": "Green infrastructure, ranging from street trees, green roofs and parks through to wildlife areas, woodlands and wetlands, can make a valuable contribution to nature recovery, by creating and connecting places which are rich in wildlife. It provides natural solutions to issues like poor air quality, flood risk and urban heating from climate change, whilst providing accessible spaces where people can enjoy the health and wellbeing benefits of contact with nature. Watch the below clip to learn more about GI."

The aim of these is to help us make our towns and cities fit for the future, for people and for nature."

            "text": "Urban green spaces alone support 2.1 million people in meeting their weekly physical activity needs. This is estimated to be worth \u00a35.6 billion and to avoid health service costs of around \u00a31.4 billion. The new resources come at a time when the need and opportunity for Green Infrastructure creation has never been greater, in addressing a range of priority issues for the government and across society more generally. The importance of high-quality GI is already recognised in the government commitment, contained in the Environmental Improvement Plan, that everyone should live within 15 minutes of green and blue space."

            "text": "We are also seeing a huge increase in the recognition of how regular contact with nature is beneficial to people\u2019s health and well-being, and the role this can play in the prevention or treatment of a range of long-term health conditions. At the same time, partnerships of local authorities, communities and wider stakeholders are providing the GI knowledge, skills, experiences and connections that enable GI planners and providers to improve their local GI to benefit the local economy, creating the towns and cities of the future."

The GI Framework and its Standards are also referenced in the consultation on the revisions of the National Planning Policy Framework."
