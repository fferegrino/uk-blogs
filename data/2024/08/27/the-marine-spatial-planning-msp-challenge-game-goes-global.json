The scenarios aimed to find space for increases in aquaculture, offshore wind, ship breaking facilities, and new marine protected areas, all while safeguarding existing interests such as fishing and tourism. The sessions were lively, and the feedback was extremely positive, providing a great opportunity to explain the MMO\u2019s role and remit."

Participants considered how different values and economic evidence bases would influence decision making."
