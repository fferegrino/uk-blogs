            "text": "We spoke with\u00a0two programme facilitators, Simone and Craig. The programme facilitator role involves working with groups of offenders completing mandatory courses as part of their probation conditions. Simone joined the Probation Service two years ago and came from a criminal justice background, previously working in the Prison Service. Craig has worked in the role for seven years and brought his experience of working with students with behavioural difficulties.\u00a0 Simone and Craig give us an insight into the skills required to be a programme facilitator, the benefits and the challenges of the role.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Simone: I deliver programmes like BBR (Building Better Relationships) and TSP (Thinking Skills Programme). BBR is offered to people convicted of domestic violence. The programme aims to help offenders gain a better understanding of the impact of their behaviour and promotes techniques of emotional self-control. The programme runs for 30 sessions, including both group and one-to-one sessions. TSP is geared towards general offending behaviours, covering self-management, problem-solving, and social interactions. Offenders will learn to develop skills like emotional control and assessment of positive and negative influences in their lives. TSP runs for 19 sessions with groups of up to 12 people.\u00a0\u00a0"

And it's quite nice that way because it's a good way to build rapport within the team and have that bonding with each other. You always meet offenders individually ahead of them starting their course and then they take part in the group delivery."

I could be on a night shift and spend 12 hours talking to offenders, gaining an understanding of what they\u2019re going through and what led them to make certain decisions. I've used these communication skills in my role now and I enjoy being able to support people in their community.\u00a0"

If you can't build rapport with the group members individually then you\u2019re not going to have that ability to connect with the group. Also, the ability to listen and take time with people who are talking about difficult situations or times in their lives and have an empathic understanding. Time management skills are important too, a typical workday spans to 8 hours, with a significant portion dedicated to session preparation and delivery.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Simone: We ask offenders to reflect, and if we don\u2019t practice it ourselves, everything falls apart. It's crucial to practice self-reflection and consider others' views, both in training and daily interactions with colleagues. This helps in continual learning and improvement. Although you don\u2019t need to be an extrovert, being comfortable standing up and interacting with a group of people is also a big part of the role, as well as believing in procedural justice and the potential for people to change.\u00a0"

For example, at 11am I could be with one group of people some with mental health issues I need to be mindful of, and I could be with another group at 5pm who have a completely different set of issues with different learning types. This may mean you need to adjust the way you speak or deliver a certain point.\u00a0"

The way we work has made such a difference in how comfortable I am at work, and we regularly check in on each other using the skills we\u2019ve learnt in training. There\u2019s a lot of self-development that happens from doing the role too. You learn a lot about yourself through this job which is not the sort of thing you get in many other workplaces.\u00a0"

It's incredibly rewarding, especially as it gets towards the end of the programme, and you see an increase in participation, motivation and engagement. It\u2019s great to see them enjoying the sessions more as they progress. I also enjoy the active, varied nature of the work and not being stuck to a desk.\u00a0"

We also fill out debrief forms in the evening, looking at what worked well and what could have been improved. Personally, I enjoy listening to podcasts on my drive home. Fortunately, our role offers flexibility; for instance, we can take afternoons off after longer shifts earlier in the week. This flexibility helps maintain a healthy work-life balance.\u00a0"
