Over the last year, we've been asking ourselves some big questions. Like what's changed socially, technologically and economically since we were set up in 2011? We've challenged ourselves to test previous assumptions and technical decisions about how digital services needed to work, thinking critically about which aspects might need to change versus what should remain the same."

Alongside colleagues from I.AI and the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO), we sat down with leaders from the USA, Trinidad and Tobago, Cyprus, Canada, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Azerbaijan, and Singapore for an inspiring (and intense!) three days of discussion, debate and storytelling. Read on for the key takeaways from our time in DC."

The group agreed that adopting modern user-centric design principles is just one of the ways digital governments around the world can build and maintain trust among our users.

These platforms already offer a consistent, accessible experience for users who interact with our government, and drive efficiency for our taxpayers. We're now expanding our channel strategy to strengthen the trust they have in our services by meeting them in more places, and offering information and support in alternative formats that work best for them."

Specifically how GOV.UK One Login could enable a faster, more personalised and more proactive experience of government in the near future."

As a group we recognised that the AI challenge is as much about the people, policies and governance as it is about the underlying technology. Working together, we can harness AI's potential to enhance public services alongside safeguarding societal values. But only if ethical governance, transparency and collaboration remain central to the work."
