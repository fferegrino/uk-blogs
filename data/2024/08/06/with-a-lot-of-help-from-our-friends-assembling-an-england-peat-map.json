The England Peat Map, due for publication in March 2025, will be the most complete map of England\u2019s peatlands and peaty soils to date.

They provide habitat for many of our most charismatic plants and animals, water storage and purification on a massive scale, and our biggest single store of carbon. They\u2019re also magical places to visit, and there are plenty of ways of doing so while still keeping your feet dry! Mapping peat is essential to understanding what benefits it provides to us, and what we need to do to secure this flow of benefits (closely linked to the flow of boggy peatland streams) into the future."

But Natural England isn\u2019t making the England Peat Map alone, and we didn\u2019t start from scratch \u2013 the map is a major collaborative effort. A huge amount of peatland data existed before this project, but it was held by lots of small or regional based projects. It had many owners, who used different data collection methods and licence agreements. The data mainly consisted of highly detailed surveys of individual sites, which would be too expensive to replicate on a national scale. All this made it difficult to see the bigger picture of the state of England\u2019s peatlands."

Between them these areas are home to 96% of England\u2019s upland peat, and have contributed over 1,500 datasets to the peat map."

In the lowlands you can find peat in a farmer's field, in woodlands or grasslands, sometimes in the most unlikely of locations. Lowland peat can be 3-4 times deeper than upland peat, making it an incredibly important store of carbon. However, it can be much harder to find as it can occur almost anywhere!"

We use these models to identify the likelihood of peaty soil presence, its depth, and associated vegetation. Field data lets us check the accuracy of the AI, allowing us to improve the models and make more confident predictions going forward. Using models like this means that we can make predictions of the likelihood of peat presence even where very little data is available."

The AI4Peat team, a separate cross-government initiative managed by Natural England, are leading this work, which will be integrated into the published England Peat Map."
