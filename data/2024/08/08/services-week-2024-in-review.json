Now, I feel even better equipped to create services that bring together best practices from examples that people shared during the week. Also, Services Week highlighted that it is important not to be complacent and to keep iterating service design as an individual and more widely, with changing times and increased experience.\u201d\u00a0"

Taking part in Services Week also helped us to connect with other organisations facing similar challenges, and we're looking forward to continuing building those relationships in the future.\u201d"

I've been joining these sessions for years, but this is the first event I've co-organised and facilitated for Services Week. I wanted to raise the representation of \u2018accessibility\u2019 on the agenda and make the session interactive where the participants can actively shape what we discuss. Designing and developing services which are as inclusive as possible is challenging and I wanted to reinforce to attendees that there are peers out there in other organisations tackling similar challenges.\u00a0"
