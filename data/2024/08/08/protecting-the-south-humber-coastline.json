            "text": "One of the big pieces of work this year will be to place more rock armour onto the existing sea-defence. Rock armour is key tool that we use to help strengthen our coastal flood defences. It\u2019s size and strength in resisting waves and erosion from the sea mean it can help the defences protect the coast for at least a further 25-years and can be re-used beyond this period."

            "text": "It is sourced sustainably with around 80% being transported by barge from Oban in Scotland, which significantly reduces carbon compared with road transportation. The rock armour is also an adaptable material meaning it \u00a0can be moved around the defences as necessary in the future to ensure it retains its strength. This may include building the armour up higher or wider in some places as required without having to install further materials."

Gravity outfall culverts are used to allow surface water through tunnels and out into the into the estuary, whilst preventing the incoming tide from puncturing the defences. The culverts will be inspected, desilted and repaired as needed with additional repairs set to be carried out to other parts of the structure at the same time. Improvements are being made to maintenance access and extra resilience measures."
