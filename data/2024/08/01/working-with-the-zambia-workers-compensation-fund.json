The mortality rate is defined as the number of people who die each year per 100,000 of the population, split by categories such as age and sex. I used this analysis to critically consider how to set our mortality assumptions for the Fund."

Reserving triangles allow us to understand how long it takes an accident to be reported (without needing to get a geometry set out!) In turn, this helps us determine the number of claims that have occurred but had not yet been reported to the WCF."
