            "text": "Serious diseases pose a threat to aquatic animal health both in aquaculture and in the wild. Many of these diseases have no effective treatment and have the potential to cause high numbers of mortalities in aquatic animals, with the consequent large economic loss and threat to biodiversity. Official control of diseases through policy and legislation is necessary to ensure a sustainable aquaculture industry that meets international standards and ensures safe trade. To be effective, disease controls must use applied science and research to inform Government policy and direct the appropriate legislation. This requires strong links between industry, science, and government. The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) at Cefas facilitates these vital connections. The resulting specialist relationships that exist between the FHI and the diagnosticians, epidemiologists, and research scientists at Cefas, and with Government and other agencies, contributes to the high standard of aquatic animal health controls for diseases of national importance, to support sustainable aquaculture and food from water."

            "text": "The UK has a high aquatic animal health status, being free of most of the serious diseases of fish and shellfish that are subject to control (known as listed diseases). The FHI at Cefas is the regulatory body responsible for the official control of these diseases in England and Wales and work hard to maintain this high health status, protecting fish stocks and industry. Their work is delivered on behalf of Defra and Welsh Government through industry authorisation and registration, compliance and disease surveillance inspection programmes, trade controls and disease investigation, and where necessary the application of statutory disease controls and enforcement measures. Collectively, the FHI have extensive experience in the aquaculture industry and related sectors for aquatic animal health and husbandry, regulation and disease control, fieldwork, biosecurity, and policy advice to Government. The FHI operate a paperless inspection, sample and data collection system which provides a large industry dataset extending back over 20 years, an invaluable tool for epidemiological modelling. A close collaborative working relationship between the FHI and Cefas research scientists also supports investigations into new and emerging diseases, an area of growing importance for the expansion of aquaculture to support sustainable food production."

We provide expert advice on science and policy to Defra, APHA and the industry.

The inspection programme also includes compliance audits of APBs to ensure they meet regulations and implement agreed biosecurity practices. Inspectors carry out aquatic animal disease investigations, which may include putting movement restrictions on animals at affected sites. Inspectors also conduct import and export inspections and sampling, at key locations such as ports and airports to facilitate safe trade in live aquatic animals. They also deliver work for the Veterinary Medicines Directorate on residue sampling and licencing audits."

The 3-year investigation saw the FHI working closely with the UK Border Force and National Crime Agency (NCA), which led to the conviction. Illegally traded eels were recovered and then repatriated back into the wild in Spain."
