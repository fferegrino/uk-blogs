At Worthing High School, we do this every Wednesday and Sunday and ask for results to be reported by 8pm on each day. To help us monitor test results, we have invested in an online portal which allows parents and students to easily log their results. We also use the monitoring data to follow up with those who haven\u2019t been testing and understand why this is. The portal also provides a direct link to the NHS Test and Trace reporting system. We send reminders at 6am twice a week on testing days via email and social media and follow up with a reminder email to any who have not logged results by 8.30pm \u2013 which we can track in our online system."

We do this through frequent texts, letters, emails and on our social media accounts."
