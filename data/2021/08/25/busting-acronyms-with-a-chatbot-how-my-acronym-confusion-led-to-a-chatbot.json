            "text": "I spent most of my time helping stakeholders design their content, making it simpler to understand and quicker to read. Often our experts do not even realise that they are using terminology or acronyms that are not universally understood."

            "text": "I noticed that there were several glossaries and dictionaries being created, used and then discarded. So I wondered if we could make one central source, maintained by everyone."

        {
            "text": "The motivation to solve this problem was to make the lives of our colleagues easier. We needed to help new and experienced colleagues to look up terms or acronyms quickly and easily. This would reduce confusion and ambiguity and make us more efficient and effective."

I thought Firebreak was a great opportunity to get together a group of like-minded skilled colleagues to see if we could solve this problem."
        },

            "text": "We first looked at some options. We researched what was out there already both internally inside DIT, and externally. Excitingly we found this 402 page PDF of Ministry of Defence acronyms and abbreviations and thought about how we could improve on this."
        },
        {
            "text": "We realised that colleagues just needed to be able to input their acronym and get a response, without needing to wade through all the other acronyms that we might use. We considered a form with an email response, but this was cumbersome and hard to use, so we needed to make it more interactive. This led us to the idea of a chatbot."

The chatbot uses Power Automate to find an explanation of the acronym in a SharePoint List, which holds all the information. This is all part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products, we didn\u2019t even need to get any additional licences."

            "text": "We also tested our solution with a small set of users. We watched them using the chatbot, as it\u2019s so insightful to actually observe their behaviour. They fed back that knowing what the acronym stood for wasn\u2019t enough to help them understand, and that an explanation would be helpful."
        },
        {
            "text": "So we iterated, adding the option of a short explanation and a link to further information. This allowed users to solve their whole problem. In addition, this meant users could look up jargon as well as acronyms, increasing the benefit, and making the lives of our colleagues easier."
