We can \u2018red-rate\u2019 the IA if this assessment of costs is not fit for purpose. We believe that this role should be continued and supplemented with transparency about the actual costs of the measure using data that would be collected and published at the post-implementation stage."

In order for post-implementation reviews (PIRs) to be effective at recommending changes to measures in the light of the actual operation of those measures, it is important to agree in advance what data and evidence is to be collected so that an effective review is possible at that later stage. Therefore, the ability to \u2018red rate\u2019 monitoring and evaluation plans before implementation is key to ensuring that policies can be effectively reviewed after implementation."

This should ensure that independent scrutiny retains the benefits of transparency and external challenge and improves outcomes for government, for Parliament and for external stakeholders in the business and CSO community. This doesn\u2019t require radical reform of a system that is already highly regarded, but some change could make it significantly more effective and support the government\u2019s objectives."
