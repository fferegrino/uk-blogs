            "text": "Since the population of London began to grow in the 1800s, successive generations have imposed differing and increasing pressures on Old Father Thames, and it began to suffer. But forward thinkers like Dr John Snow \u2013 whose findings, including the link between cholera and water, led to fundamental changes in the management of water, and Sir Joseph Bazalgette - who built London\u2019s sewers, sewage works and the river embankments, led the change and understanding needed to cope with an expanding population and the effects of that on the quality of the river."

            "text": "Over decades, improvements to sewage treatment and regulation of discharges enabled the river to support a wide range of fish and aquatic flora and fauna. But there are still many challenges, not least \u2018urbanisation\u2019 - that means more of us living in towns and cities. The associated increase in population needs clean water for drinking. Much of this comes from the freshwater Thames."

        {
            "text": "One of the consequences of urbanisation is more buildings and fewer porous surfaces. Thunderstorms and heavy rain, which we are seeing more frequently because of climate change, can cause flash flooding and storm overflows to operate."

            "text": "Understanding the city\u2019s sewerage system, and how many of the lost rivers of London became combined sewer overflows, has been fascinating. And, in case you were wondering, the reason why the river is cloudy and brown is due to natural silt, not pollution."

        {
            "text": "When spills from storm overflows occur, millions of tonnes of diluted sewage can enter the river causing a drop in dissolved oxygen levels, and impacting fish and other wildlife.\u00a0 Part of my job is to keep an eye on these events using our real-time monitoring network and take action if we predict that levels might drop too low.\u00a0 That action comes in the form of two boats owned by Thames Water; The Vitality and The Bubbler, which can each inject 30 tonnes of oxygen into the river per day. I monitor water quality and coordinate the mitigation response by deploying the Bubblers or dosing with peroxide. I am proud to call myself one of five \u201cBubbler Controllers\u201d."

But there\u2019s a much more fundamental, and large-scale programme of work under way to address the issue of sewage treatment and storm overflows discharging into the River Thames."

            "text": "The London Tideway Improvements is a multi-billion pound programme of work bringing London\u2019s drainage up to modern-day standards. There are several stages to the work; the first was the extension of Thames Water\u2019s sewage works along the Thames which was completed in 2013. It has made a huge difference to water quality, making the river more resilient to storm overflow discharges. The second was the Lee Tunnel, capturing spills from the largest of the storm overflows at Abbey Mills and transferring them to the recently-enlarged Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. This has enabled the recovery of the Channelsea River and tidal River Lee, where the resident seal dubbed \u2018ChannelSealy\u2019 feeds on the fish."

            "text": "The final stage of the improvements is the Thames Tideway Tunnel which is currently under construction and is often known as the \u2018Super Sewer\u2019. This massive feat of engineering is currently visible in the form of tunnelling and connection shafts along the Thames in London. A tunnel with an eight metre diameter will stretch 25 kilometres from Acton and Hammersmith to Abbey Mills where it will connect with the Lee Tunnel."

            "text": "The resulting London Tideway Tunnels system will divert millions of tonnes of storm sewage away from the river, carrying it by gravity to Beckton in east London where it will be pumped up 80 metres from the deepest shaft in London for treatment."

But even with these improvements, the Thames and other rivers will still feel the impacts of climate change and urbanisation. Pollution events will still occur, but we can all do our bit to prevent them."

On the left you see a barge taking spoil from the Thames Tideway Tunnel site at Kirtling Street, part of the modern-day solution of river pollution. The pressures on the environment will always exist and we will have to find ways of coping with them. This gives a glimpse into the multi-faceted way in which the public and organisations have come together to find sophisticated solutions to some of our capital\u2019s problems."
