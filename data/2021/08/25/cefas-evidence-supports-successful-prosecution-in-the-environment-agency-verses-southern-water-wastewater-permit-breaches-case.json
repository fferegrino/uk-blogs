The Environment Agency also highlighted their response to the case which saw 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges taking place in Kent, Hampshire and Sussex between 2010 and 2015. Cefas\u2019 involvement in this successful prosecution is a tangible example of how our water quality research makes a real difference to supporting production of safe seafood."

These pollution events negatively impacted businesses and community groups, with discharges into designated shellfish waters causing a long-term deterioration in the shellfish flesh quality, leaving some areas unsuitable for harvesting shellfish for human consumption and resulting in lost business for shellfish producers."

This report focused on the impact and potential impact of unpermitted sewage discharges affecting commercially important bivalve mollusc (e.g. oyster and mussels)\u00a0shellfish beds and the shellfish protected areas of The Swale, North Kent."

            "text": "The Cefas report concluded that in relation to human health risk, the frequency and duration of sewage spills in The Swale during the period 2010\u20132015 were likely to present the potential for an elevated risk to human health from consumption of contaminated shellfish. Work undertaken predicted that levels of norovirus in shellfish for the period of the un-permitted discharges exceeded the average levels obtained in shellfish samples from elsewhere, that have been linked to cases of norovirus illness."

Recognising the environmental and economic damage that sewer overflow spills cause is vital to ensure that water companies are held to account and going forward that the environment is better protected.\u201d"

Between 2007 and 2015 Cefas produced similar reports for all shellfish harvesting areas in England and Wales on behalf of the Food Standards Agency, includes of Kent and the Solent."
