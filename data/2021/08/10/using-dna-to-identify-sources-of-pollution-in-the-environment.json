But faecal pollution \u2013 including from dogs - can pose health risks to water users. Dog poo contains harmful bacteria, viruses and parasites and even if your dog poops on land it can end up in the water after heavy rainfall. So remember to always bag it and bin it \u2013 any bin will do!"

We\u2019ve developed cutting edge DNA technology to help us understand where the bacteria in water has come from. For example, if the bacteria identified are typically found in cows or sheep, then agriculture is likely to be the source of pollution. Being able to trace the source of poo helps us, in partnership with others, reduce or eliminate the risk of pollution finding its way into water."

During the pandemic, our scientists have been using sewage samples to tell us where COVID-19 outbreaks are emerging, days before they appear in the community. You can find out more about this important work."

Analysing the DNA found in water samples is a quick and very effective way of identifying what creatures are in the water. This information can in turn give an indication of the quality of that water. Certain fish and aquatic species are only found in good or poor water quality environments. Identifying the presence, or absence, of these so-called \u2018indicator species\u2019 is a really good way of telling if water quality is good or poor."
