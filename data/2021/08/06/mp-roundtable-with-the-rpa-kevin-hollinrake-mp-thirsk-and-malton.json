Held at the Galtres Centre in Easingwold, Paul Caldwell, our CEO, Rozanne Kidd, an RPA Director, members of the senior RPA team and colleagues from the Future Farming Countryside Programme (FFCP) met with a wide variety of farmers and land agents from the local area."

        {
            "text": "The Q&A session sparked some good debate and some interesting questions from farmers \u2013 were the RPA prepared to deliver the new schemes; concern on impacts of the forthcoming BPS reductions; clarity on SFI pilot queries; the need for further detail on the future schemes; some suggestions to minimise the impact of future policy changes; a request to provide specific support to farmers affected by adverse weather conditions. There was recognition of the work RPA had done to get payments out in a timely fashion and its response to those affected by the flooding."
