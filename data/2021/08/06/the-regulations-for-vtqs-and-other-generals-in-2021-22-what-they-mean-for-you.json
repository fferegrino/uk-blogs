Whilst it wasn\u2019t possible for all exams and assessments to go ahead during 2020-21, due to the pandemic, it is the government\u2019s intention that they should go ahead this year. As the qualifications\u2019 regulator we expect all results this year to be awarded based on evidence from those exams and assessments. Having considered how we might best do this, we and the Department for Education (DfE) carried out a public consultation to consider what the impact of our proposals might be. That\u2019s now completed and policy and regulatory arrangements are now in place.\u00a0 We can now set out what these arrangements mean for colleges, training providers, schools and other centres."

Your concern about the impact of this disruption was evident in the responses to this consultation. And should there be further disruption, if the public health situation gets worse, then these students may also need further support over the next year."

Right now, that means they need to accommodate and mitigate the ongoing impact of the pandemic. That\u2019s why we are continuing to allow awarding organisations to adapt their exams and assessments for vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs)."

We are requiring awarding organisations to consider if they need to make adaptations to assessment, so that time can be freed up for teaching and learning.

            "text": "Whilst assessments may be streamlined, that does not mean that it is appropriate to reduce qualification content. DfE\u2019s expectation is that all the content for VTQs included in performance tables\u00a0and\u00a0used alongside or instead of GCSEs, AS and A levels, should be taught to support student progression to further study or employment. Likewise, we expect that all the content for professional, occupational, proficiency\u00a0or licence to practise qualifications will be taught. We expect awarding organisations to seek the support of sector and professional bodies for any adaptations to the assessment of these qualifications. This is important to assure employers that students of these qualifications have the knowledge and skills they expect."

            "text": "Some respondents to the consultation were concerned that some of the adaptations put in place this year were insufficient and, in some cases, inconsistent. We know from the colleges, training providers and schools we have spoken to over the last 6 months, that you find assessments more manageable to implement when you get clear information in a timely manner. We are expecting awarding organisations to address this: to collaborate so that inconsistencies are minimised; to communicate with you, clearly and accurately, and in co-ordination with one another where possible. Of course, that does not mean that all qualifications will have the same adaptations. The adaptations must suit the existing assessment design and how the qualifications are delivered."

            "text": "Teacher Assessed Grades (TAGs) were implemented only where assessments and exams could not take place. And as the intention is that exams and assessments will take place, they are not required. However, should it not be possible for exams and assessments to go ahead in the future due to a worsening of the pandemic, then our regulatory arrangements are on stand-by. So, we can respond swiftly and allow awarding organisations to award results based on alternative evidence, including TAGs, if necessary. And if that were necessary, it will most likely be drawn from the assessments and evidence that learners normally undertake and produce throughout their programme. That means you can focus on working with students to undertake their adapted assessments and exams, rather than preparing additional assessment or extra evidence \u2018just in case\u2019."

We\u2019ve seen different regions be impacted to varying extents, and for different periods of time. And it may be that some learners might yet have their learning more disrupted than others, perhaps due to the impacts on a particular trade or sector. We\u2019re working through with awarding organisations how adaptations can accommodate these circumstances."
