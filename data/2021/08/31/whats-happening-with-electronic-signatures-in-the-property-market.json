This was the first time in the history of HM Land Registry that non-mortgage deeds signed using electronic signatures could be registered and we have been encouraged by the developments being made by signature platforms and technology firms to design products that meet the requirements of practice guide 8 section 13\u00a0and facilitate their use."
