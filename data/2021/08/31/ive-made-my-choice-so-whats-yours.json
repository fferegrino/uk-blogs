That\u2019s why the thought of receiving the COVID-19\u00a0 vaccine was a little bit scary to begin with. Like many of us, I had to sift through and make sense of information pouring in from all directions."

            "text": "The real deal breaker was the fact this is not only about me and my health, but the impact not having the vaccine can have on society and the wider public. Ultimately, we are all in this together and everyone should play their part, especially when working with vulnerable people who may have pre-existing medical conditions."

            "text": "During the second lockdown in March this year, Cygnet Health Care launched a video campaign called #ihadthevaccine, urging ethnic minority communities to have the vaccine. The campaign, set up by the Cygnet Multicultural Network, has been vital in providing colleagues and care staff across the sector with an alternative reliable source of information. This has included positive personal experiences to counter the misinformation rife among some ethnic minority communities."
