So, we have some pretty talented people in HCS, from things like architecture, right through to quite low level engineering. And we also have product specialists, as well as product managers, business analysts, and, you know, product owner. So we had to build a team reasonably quickly for this requirement, because we really wanted to test that migration to SaaS experience, we wanted to get a handle on how we would cope with that as an organisation and how we deal with it, and really wanted to build up some good practice, because we know that the trend for uptake of SaaS is increasing."

So we needed to pull in someone who could get a handle on business analysis, on communications with the user community. We needed very strong architecture expertise, we needed good experience of using the platform. And we needed some systems engineering and product engineering expertise as well. So that was the team that we wanted to put together. And we also wanted to experiment with some ways of working as well, to see if we could push the Agile ways of working a little bit further on as well and maybe learn from that."

We built a team with many sort of skills and capabilities and of a couple of the ones that that also spring to mind is certainly the testing side. Because we felt we identified early on that testing was going to be a very critical part of the project. And we reached out to the department's testing team to engage with them and make sure that they were on board with the project and became part of the wider project team. So that was really good."

And that was very critical piece of work that we did to get that team formed early and to engage with them throughout the project. And they're just two examples really of some of the things that we were doing and in addition to the business analysis and the architecture and engineering work that was also critical."

The guidance that we put in place was really useful for them and they really engaged with that guidance and made that transition really swiftly."

But our team is working specifically with customers that are looking to migrate to the cloud. So we have a lot of experience in working with a lot of our enterprise customers. And we like to say that we are now the dedicated resource for the individual projects for the customer. We do recommend for them to have a dedicated project manager and the resources technical in place. But we offer that additional expertise, best practices and alignment from the experience that we gathered there."

            "text": "Paul Fearn\u00a0 "

            "text": "So DWP Digital, the IT department in DWP, has been using Jira now for well over five years, I would say in some guise or another. And, in fact, has gone through upgrades and migrations before but not to the cloud SaaS service. So this was the first time for DWP.\u00a0 And in terms of its usage across the department, it's quite widespread, we've got an agile delivery approach to our project work. So we've got, you know, over sort of circa 2,000 people there using Jira in a sort of classic Kanban or Agile sprint type way of controlling and managing their works in terms of tasks and that comes with all the classic, you know, use of epics and stories and tasks behind it. So that's a really key use case within DWP."
        },
        {
            "text": "And in addition to that, we've got lots of other users as well across the department that are not particularly involved in those day to day project activities but are involved in key delivery aspects. Particularly examples might be service transition where we have a team that supports the transition of that service through into production. And they also use Jira and many of its capabilities to help and track that work through to completion."
        },
        {
            "text": "So quite a diverse really use of Jira in the department and, you know, circa 4,500 users typically, and many different roles in terms of structuring access control to these projects and Confluence spaces that we have. So very typically, we have project leads that do a lot of the administration and a team that supports administration requests, so that they can be serviced."
        },
        {
            "text": "So very, very key to all really within the DWP digital business for delivering IT. And using other tools as well, such as, you know, continuous integration, continuous development and also collaboration tools as well. So, Jira fits very nicely into the tooling set that DWP Digital uses. And it's also got some real great capabilities in terms of its integration with Confluence as a sort of collaboration, wiki type tool that can really help you move forward with your tasks very quickly, in terms of brainstorming and you know, doing things like meeting minutes and things like that. And in fact, it's no surprise that we use Jira, well certainly we use Confluence in the migration project to help the delivery of this the migration project as well."
        },
        {
            "text": "So yeah, really key tool for DWP Digital and moving to cloud was really put in great foundation in place for DWP Digital moving forward now with the challenges that typical project delivery brings."

            "heading": 3,
            "text": "Paul Fearn\u00a0 "
        },
        {
            "text": "So there were quite a few different reasons for doing this migration. Firstly, we were supporting an existing Jira Confluence service that we were managing the infrastructure for. And we certainly wanted to get the benefits of moving to a cloud SaaS solution so that Atlassian did all that sort of management for us and that would free up our resources."
        },
        {
            "text": "But more importantly perhaps is being able to take advantage of the new features that cloud brings us and Atlassian, continually developing their products all the time. So we don't have the headache of having to upgrade our tooling to take advantage of these things, they would just naturally come through the release cycle and we as a business would be able to take advantage of those features."
        },
        {
            "text": "And I guess lastly, the sort of support aspects of service, we're moving to a different team. So it was really important that you know, that team had only got the sort of typical Jira Confluence administration skills, so they didn't have any skills around infrastructure support. So that was another key reason that we needed to move to cloud first in order to transition to another support team. And the cloud SaaS Jira Confluence service, really gives us some real improvements around new features, security performance, and really the sort of availability as well, because the service that we were supporting previously, was somewhat troublesome and had not really had much love past 18 months to sort of make sure that the service was always available to our user community. So quite a diverse range of reasons for moving to the platform. But fundamentally, this is a step forward really for this particular tool in in DWP."

            "text": "We want to experiment a little bit with the command and control structures that I've seen in play up to now. We wanted to see if we removed some of those things if whether the team would step up and take responsibility for some of those aspects. So it was a bit of a risk involved in this, a kind of calculated risk. What what we really wanted to build the team dynamic and test the team dynamic and see how strong that is. How does that develop? How quickly does it develop? And the only way to do that for as far as we could see was to dial back the micromanagement side of things and just see how much of that we really need if we've got a strong team. And that came together pretty quickly. It was pretty easy to do that and the size of the team is quite important in there. You can't really do this with a team of more than 12. And you can't do with really a team of less than three or four. So we had a good size of team to try this on."
        },
        {
            "text": "And as the as the weeks went by, you could see that the team itself was becoming self aware and stronger over time. And I guess the big test for me as a consultant looking at this was ask a question of the team and see how consistent the answers are from everyone. And that certainly started to happen fairly early on. We were starting to see that the feeling of everyone in the team was starting to gel in terms of where we wanted to go, how realistic our estimates were, how quickly we could get things done. All these things started to sort of level out. So it was a very interesting thing to witness to actually watch that team begin to build. We've carried some of these lessons into the other work that we're doing within the department."

And I will say that this team has been extremely open and has built a trust for the project and for ensuring that everyone is there preparing for the success of the project. And it was just a pleasure to work with the team and to see how much everyone is working to ensure that this project will be successful."

            "text": "So, we had a daily stand up which is no big surprise for anyone that's been doing Agile work. Daily standup is really kind of a check in for the team. So it's where you raise any concerns or flag any opportunities. And also make sure that that other members of the team kind of know what you're up to and how things are going in general. So that was that was kind of a good anchor point for the team on a daily basis."
        },
        {
            "text": "And we also had a weekly check-in with the team, which was kind of semi formalized. We had a range of things we wanted to cover, but we didn't we didn't follow a kind of timed agenda or anything like that. What we found was that that that meeting tended to last less than an hour. We stuck to that. I think it was Tuesday afternoon, we stuck to that religiously for the whole project. And that gave us a good chance to kind of both reflect on where we\u2019d come to in the project and also do a little bit of micro planning for the week ahead up to the next checkpoint. And the third thing we did was we separated our risks issues, assumptions work, with those kind of analysis sessions that teams have, we separated that out into a separate session, which we called risk mitigation. So that that was particularly helpful, because it meant that we could just focus on risk mitigation. And it didn't take very long I think typically it took about 10 minutes a week to do that. And these sessions were quite valuable because they allowed us to make that a bit of a team sport. Just thinking back to what Ramona said, making these these activities more of a team game is very important. And we certainly did that with our treatment of risks and issues and assumptions and whatnot and we kept a good handle on those for the for the life of the project. It was good."

So we were pretty honest with Atlassian at the start about what we wanted to do and how we wanted to do it. And on to their credit, they were pretty honest with us about their expectations, and also their experience of working with customers. So it was a very healthy environment in which to talk about our successes, but also talk about some of the challenges that we faced as well."

And, you know, we'd not overlooked anything. We were all confident then that we could see a way forward.

It was it was a really, really well-oiled mechanism that was pushing this in, I can't describe how impressed I was with the expertise, with the young engineers that we had pushing this into place.

So, you know, Atlassian really helped us to achieve that. And it was very critical that we were able to get that testing done as quickly as possible. We were working to certain timelines, and we knew that the migration would have to be over a weekend. So, you know, there were certain weekends that were kind of unavailable to us, if you know what I mean. But fortunately, it landed really well, in terms of the timing."

And throughout the migration one of the key things was for us was the dress rehearsal, it really was. That was the pinnacle test for us in proving that this thing worked end to end, and doing all the checks and balances on the data, to make sure that we hadn't lost anything, that all the users have been migrated, all of the Jira projects had migrated, and all the Confluence spaces had been migrated. So quite a complex migration, as you would expect, but one that we managed to achieve and with the support of Atlassian, and, and their sort of guidance, and pretty impressive documentation at times to help us achieve that was really superb."

We provided an FAQ, which Paul kicked off in the early stages of the project and grew to tens of questions in there with very detailed answers, which the user community responded to. They didn't keep coming to us asking the same questions, they actually took note that we had produced an FAQ, and they went and read it and used that to get things done. So in terms of, you know, economy of effort, we did a pretty good job on the project, we didn't waste a lot of time. But that said, I would say probably 40% of the total project time we built in as contingency, partly because the platform that we were migrating from had not been loved. So we weren't sure about what the consequences of that might be during a migration. And we also had quite a large volume of users as well. We didn't want to lose any of their data. So it was interesting to start working through some of those dependencies and taking the time to understand them."

And we had lots of questions coming in. And we had the whole team ready on those webinars to answer questions on the on the Teams chat and that worked really well. We had all kinds of questions coming in whilst Linda was presenting and we were able to answer those in real time. So that kind of user engagement thing, that's something that we really wanted to push the boundary on and see how good can we make this, how well can we do this. And it was recognised by the user community that we had gone the extra mile to make sure that they were fully informed about what we did and also that they had the opportunity to engage with the whole team, so it I guess it comes back to that sort of flatter hierarchical, getting rid of some of those hierarchies so we didn't push people into our front door or anything like that. We just said, you can just talk to the team on these on these webinars, and they did. So it was it was good from our perspective."

It's really important to not be not be too worried about adding in more contingency, even though the start of the project, it might look like it's rather a lot of time, we did use the majority of that contingency."

So we went through it at a snail's pace to really understand what each step really looked like. And then we did a full speed, almost a full speed version of that. And then we did a full dress rehearsal, where we were essentially behaving as if that was the live migration. And the reason we did that was to test al all of our mechanisms within the project and Atlassian\u2019s mechanisms and our other partners\u2019 mechanisms and even the user community itself. We wanted to get a realistic feel for how those things would respond as a system for the migration event, that's why we did the dry run, the full dress rehearsal."

And I'm so glad that we did it because everyone learned such a lot from the exercise, it gave the team a high level of confidence when we were heading into the final two weeks of the project. And that was an ambition that we stated at the start of the project, we said we want to be coasting into the migration, we did not want to be panicky or nervous or anything like that. As a team, we want to be just strolling into that migration event, very confident. And that's exactly what happened."

I was a bit worried because it was such an important project and we say that for some of our customers, they perform this migration just once and that's all for the lifetime.

So we had the usual very busy Monday, where we're kind of just doing lots and lots of checks on the system and lots of phoning around teams to make sure that everything is as we hoped it would be. But I think the thing that really struck me was on our internal Tuesday call, our internal team call, where it was a bit like tumbleweed because we hadn't really got very much to talk about because the migration had just gone really very much to plan. Not better than expected, because we were expecting it to go well, but it just went so smoothly that there wasn't really anything to pick up in that week. We got to that Tuesday call and the call lasted about 10 minutes, because we didn't really have an awful lot to say other than well done everybody, we've actually done this, you know, we've pulled this off. So to me that that was a great sign that the team had had kind of come through on this. And it was really down to that team dynamic. And thinking back to other projects and things I've been involved in over the last 30 odd years, the biggest successes that I've seen have been really down to having strong team dynamics."

You know if you have that trust, you build that trust, both within the team and you build that trust with your partners and your suppliers, especially on the supplier side, that is such a worthwhile thing to do and it pays huge dividends."

So we're still kind of learning how to do this, how to build that trust again with supply chain on a one to one basis, on more of a partnering basis. So it was a great case study for us for how to build that trust as well. Just going back to Ramona\u2019s comment about, having this more honest relationship, this no BS kind of relationship. I think that was a really important reason why this project worked. Because Atlassian are that kind of company, that they have that kind of ethos, I think that was something I hadn't appreciated until we hit some interesting talking points partway through the project, we were having heated discussions about things. And it was that trust, that no BS thing that really pulled through for us that really allowed us to sort of keep our belief system alive as a group, and believe that we can overcome those things. For me, that was really interesting to see how that how that worked."

And that was the goal that we wanted to achieve it's why we set out in doing this the way we set out to do it, so that we could achieve that. And, you know, so that was a really great thing. And following on from that, you know, several months after the migration now. You know, it's also great to see the takeup that the users have started using that some of the new features available on the cloud SaaS solution, to drive out much more value for the department. So that equally is also a real good plus for me that we've achieved our objective as well in enabling our users with these features that they can use to deliver better for DWP."

And I understand Atlassian\u2019s nervousness about us not using a partner organisation, but one of the one of the reasons that we wanted to do it on our own was that we have to build and keep building that capability within the department, that technical capability. We need to start building our confidence in ourselves in terms of the technology and not see partners as a first resort, but see them as a place where we can go where we need to. But certainly, the engineers that we had were just brilliant on this project, they really, really stepped up."

But I would say, really focus on that on that team dynamic, be as open as possible. The other groups that you involve in the project, try to adopt them into your team if you can. We did that with the new service support team, we involved them in quite early on in the project and opened everything up to them. We also did that with the test and release team, we were super helpful throughout the project, and they really helped us to build a lot of confidence in what we were doing.

And that gave us a big confidence boost when they came back and said the preparations looked pretty solid. And they gave us a few little nuggets of things to help us to put the final pieces in place. But the relationship with Atlassian was really pivotal for us. So I would strongly advise working more openly with your partner organisation, certainly supply chain,"
