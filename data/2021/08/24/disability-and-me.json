I do live with a disability though. I have epilepsy but it\u2019s not how I define myself.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t work out how to answer. By saying no, the diversity statistics would be wrong, but by saying yes, I would give an untrue answer. I said no, and gave a pithy comment at the end\u2026."

I may have driven home from the office afterwards, but have no memory of doing so. The next day, my GP sent me to the local A&E in Brussels where they carried out a range of tests and this time, gave a formal diagnosis of Epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0"

This included regular lifts to the office (NATO is not great to get to, by public transport) whilst the\u00a0 Ambassador at the time, Peter Ricketts \u2013 later National Security Advisor, used to invite me to stay over at the residence after official dinners. Back then, taxis cost about \u20ac40 for the evening, and at the time, the office refused to help with transport costs to official functions. Now, thankfully they do help.\u00a0\u00a0"

I do still find this odd, as it\u2019s really not how I think of myself.\u00a0 I was fortunate though - I was already an adult, had set a career path and self image and although there were minor bumps, I found myself working for an organisation that, even 20 years ago, took the diagnosis in its stride."
