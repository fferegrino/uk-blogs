I help the team learn about the people who use the service, to understand the bigger picture so that we can improve the service for users and solve problems for the organisation. I\u2019m embedded in a multidisciplinary team where a lot of our focus is on understanding the needs of service users and other teams and colleagues in the Environment Agency. For example, understanding the back-office workflow and the intricacies of how maps are created has been a large part of my research."

The research has helped the team learn about the complexities of the data used to create the product. This has led to us changing our approach to how we will deliver the service so that we still deliver improvements for our customers and business efficiencies. "
