I am the CCTV Manager at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, Chairman of the Public CCTV Managers Association and I represent the Local Government Association at the National Police Chiefs' Council CCTV working group."

My strand is focused on local authorities, promoting good practice, BSCC third-party certification and partnership working. More specifically, I have been working with a number of key partners in developing a Framework Service Level Agreement (SLA) guidance document for local authorities and police forces. This document can also be used by other agencies for their use of surveillance camera systems."

            "text": "The Service Level Agreement framework is a guidance document designed to help you and your organisation develop an SLA yourselves. It is not in itself an SLA but a tool to help you ensure you have included all the minimum requirements that would be expected to be included in one. The sections that are outlined are not exhaustive; there is no \u2018one size fits all' SLA and it should be completed in conjunction with the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice (SC Code) and its 12 guiding principles issued under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012."

            "text": "An effective SLA is a crucial part of any partnership working arrangements between organisations. This template has been designed specifically for partnerships between relevant authorities defined at section 33(5) of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (local authorities and police forces) regarding the operation of surveillance camera systems. However, it will be of use for any partnership working. The aim is to help facilitate an effective partnership addressing a number of areas of collaborative working including Information Sharing Agreements, directed surveillance, vetting, training, sharing live images, feedback and welfare of staff. It also sets out standards and procedures that will in turn reassure the public that the use of surveillance is proportionate, necessary and lawful."

CCTV is also 100% effective for establishing crimes have been committed, linking crimes, identifying victims, establishing cause of death, eliminating post charge suspects, charging suspects, and providing admission of guilt, and is over 96% effective in identifying persons of interest.*"
