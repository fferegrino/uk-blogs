This isn\u2019t intended to replace our engagement and co-design work \u2013 far from it \u2013 but rather it\u2019s to complement it. It is an additional handy resource to help us make the right decisions."

I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been contacted by colleagues to help them with the farmer's perspective on a piece of work."

            "text": "Many of my Defra colleagues talk to a host of farmers as part of their work, and increasingly so as we work closely with the farming industry to co-design our new farming policy. It's hard to get across how grateful many farmers are when they are to be able to talk to someone \u00a0with farming experience in addition to all the \u2018formal\u2019 work we do with farmers and land managers \u2013 the most common comment I get is \u2018This is absolute gold!\u2019"
