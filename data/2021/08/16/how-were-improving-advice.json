For example, it might relate to a specific holding or situation. The relationship between the parties can mean that over time, a high-degree of trust is established. The adviser can be from a delivery partner (Natural England or Forestry Commission for example) or from a commercial organisation."

Balancing these requirements is vital for a successful advice service."
