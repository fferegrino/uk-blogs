This is an important part of achieving Mission 1 of the Government Digital Service\u2019s (GDS) strategy, as well as tying into the GOV.UK objective to support the government's priorities of the day."

            "text": "One way we looked at this was through the user feedback left on GOV.UK. It\u2019s possible for users to leave their comments on every page on GOV.UK. Feedback left this way highlights what\u2019s working well, and also points out users\u2019 concerns. We also wanted to make our work on user feedback available to our GDS colleagues. This blog post explains how we looked at the user feedback and shared our insights."

User feedback could act as an invaluable source of extremely important context, letting us quickly spot where the guidance and government services could be improved. Still, we needed to be able to analyse and act on the learnings much quicker than we had done previously."

            "text": "Throughout the past year, whilst driving improvements in data quality and access, and helping the programme to spot issues faster, we also raised the profile of the importance of user feedback for our colleagues. For example, user feedback showed that people were using the unofficial term \u2018tiers\u2019 rather than \u2018local alert levels\u2019, so we made the change to that term on GOV.UK to make it easier for people searching for the guidance."

            "text": "The level of detail needed by users is always a difficult balance between concise guidance and providing an overwhelming amount of information. User feedback following the January national lockdown helped identify where guidance needed to be more specific, for example \u201ccan tradespeople enter people\u2019s homes to carry out their work?\u201d. Feedback was also helpful in highlighting the need for clarity around overnight stays in private residences and hotels, as well as further detail around wedding attendances."

We are keen to continue making sure the right stakeholders across government get the most relevant feedback, so that it can be acted upon in a swift manner."

This helps implement GOV.UK\u2019s vision of delivering trusted, joined-up and personalised interactions for users, and will let us scale up analysis across GOV.UK."
