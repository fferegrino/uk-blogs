As a PM, I consider myself lucky to have moved from B2C products (Mobile Apps) to B2B (Enterprise Retail Technology) to now Data Platforms. I gained the experience of building different types of products, solving hard problems for different organisations.\u00a0"

When the opportunity to work on the Analytical Platform came along, it was an easy decision for me because I wanted to try something new, and my product career has always been driven by making an impact and trying to change the world. (Yes, really!)."

This allows our users to build machine learning models, analyse unstructured data, process complex data sets, build data products, and in general do a lot of great work with data.\u00a0"

To solve this, I have adopted a continuous prioritisation framework in our team, creating our method, which transformed the way we think about our priorities."

            "text": "As a PM, I like to keep the roadmaps simple and focused on outcomes. With a platform, you can still achieve that but the roadmap has to take a long-term view to manage the expectations of the different stakeholders who are also more technical. You have to constantly try and think about the maintainability and reliability of your platform, and that is usually reflected in your roadmap.\u00a0\u00a0"

In my experience, thinking creatively and keeping an open mind does help a lot; avoid one-size fits all approach and always try to understand the bigger picture.\u00a0"
