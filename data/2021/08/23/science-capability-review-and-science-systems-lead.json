There is significant scope to shape and lead this work, finding opportunities and prioritising to improve science capability across government."

            "text": "Key to this role will be developing an understanding of how government uses science and evidence, exploring the connections' science has with policy, analysis and others within government and its interactions externally with academia and industry. You will use that knowledge to identify how and where government can best use and improve those systems to build capability and ensure provision of prompt and excellent scientific advice within government. An area already identified as needing improvement is government engagement with Academia and Industry and you may be involved in delivery of projects to support this area."
