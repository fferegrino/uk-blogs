KAs are becoming increasingly important to the economy and can realise huge financial, economic and social benefits in the public and private sectors. This event allowed us to showcase the brilliance of this work and the exciting journey ahead, with some key speakers providing real world examples. If you couldn\u2019t join us on the day, please watch the recording here."

Critically, the laser system is invisible and can cause loss of life. Technology advances means that this threat is becoming increasingly common for soldiers. Sentinel have developed a technology that can see that invisible laser radiation and knows where it is and what it is. The goal is to create a product that can provide users with this information which will provide greater situational awareness and ultimately save lives. They are exceeding the capabilities of current laser detectors at a fraction of the cost by using parts used in mobile phones alongside their own intellectual property."

In 2020, 2.3m women were diagnosed with breast cancer,\u00a0with 685,000 deaths globally\u200b. Early detection is a key to the effective management of\u00a0the disease\u200b. They have invented the world\u2019s first dedicated breast density assessment device. It will have a quick 2-minute scan time, be quantitative, non-ionising\u200b, comfortable\u200b and simple. After a 2-minute scan, doctors will be instantly provided with\u00a0a breast density assessment\u200b. Phil also discussed diabetes\u00a0as a major global health challenge. \u200bDiabetic foot ulcers\u00a0cause significant harm\u200b with 170 foot amputations each week in the England. No easy way exists\u00a0to detect, manage and reduce suffering but it is up to 90% preventable\u00a0if detected early by accurate thermometry\u200b."

This needed to be able to tolerate the rigours of space travel, to be low maintenance, compact, low-power and vibration tolerance accurate system as well as exceptionally robust. The STFC team realised that there could be alternative industrial uses for this on earth. A spin out company was created, raising more than \u00a38m in private sector funding, creating a range of high-tech jobs. The product is now being sold in several countries including Japan, USA, Australia and Sweden, tackling problems in sectors such as biotech, chemicals and pharmaceuticals."
