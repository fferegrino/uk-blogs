However, my latest role as a Customer Training Executive has been eye opening for myself and my team in appreciating the many different accessibility requirements for customers and colleagues - and there is much more to learn!"

Before my first webinar, we did not have a live captioning function, and I soon received feedback from customers who are D/deaf or hard of hearing that were not able to follow our webinars. While webinars were a benefit for customers with sight loss, it was then apparent that other groups of our customers could not take part."

I cannot take credit for the title of this blog, as it was a theme highlighted by an attendee of a brilliant Civil Service Live talk called \u2018Think Inclusion: Communicating with all\u2019, but it really did strike a chord with me. I firmly believe and advocate that no matter what your background is, we all have the right to be able to access the same services, accessibility should be built in from the start by default."
