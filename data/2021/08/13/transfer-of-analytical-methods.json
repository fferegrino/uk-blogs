            "text": "There should be a formal process for the introduction of new methods which allows the receiving laboratory to demonstrate that they can perform the analytical method effectively and reproducibly. It should also ensure that the transfer protocol covers all critical quality attributes and method parameters considered important for maintaining the method\u2019s validated state and ensuring product quality can be consistently met by the receiving laboratory."

            "text": "Regulatory compliance is a shared responsibility and a collaborative approach will give both the transferring and receiving laboratories confidence in the data generated after the AMT is completed. For instance, performing a gap analysis would allow both parties to identify additional validation activities that may be required, and receiving laboratories should identify whether they have the staff and testing capacity to perform testing prior to AMT commencing."
