In this blog, we hear from Drs. Luis Hernandez-Triana and Suzanna Bell, APHA Discipline Champions and experts in the field of vector borne diseases, as they tell us more about APHA\u2019s work on this specialist area."

            "text": "APHA has several Discipline Champions, who are specialists in their areas of expertise and at the forefront of animal science, responding to the growing challenges of rapid disease and pest control and outbreaks. They are responsible for developing a strategy that expands and further develops the breadth of skills, testing capability and knowledge within the Agency. This is particularly important for our response to the threat of VBDs of livestock and plants, and our aim to build collaborations with other government and non-government institutions in this important area. As such, we are exploring techniques of vector borne disease detection and surveillance using advanced technology and applying these to support disease monitoring and risk analysis in the UK."

APHA is the UK National Reference Laboratory (main testing and advice centre) for mosquito-borne viruses such as WNV and Rift Valley fever virus."

        {
            "text": "If a human is bitten by a mosquito carrying WNV, most people do not experience any symptoms and the infection usually goes away without treatment. Infected horses often do not display any clinical signs; however, some may become uncoordinated, listless, have facial paralysis or find it difficult to stand. In severe cases, WNV can cause death in infected horses."

            "text": "WNV is not present in the UK and is officially-free of WNV. The virus, however, has been spreading throughout Europe in recent years, where it circulates with Usutu and Sindbis virus, highlighting the importance of surveillance to detect cases."

In addition, we have a special high containment insectary housing invasive mosquito species (which could act as potential vectors of pathogens zoonotic for animals and humans) such as Aedes albopictus, Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, allowing APHA scientists to undertake vital research on these particular mosquitos in a safe environment."

The research led to the establishment of this rapid method to detect African Swine Fever, Bovine Ephemeral Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, Louping Ill, Tick-Borne Disease, Usutu and West Nile. This leaves APHA uniquely placed to rapidly detect important diseases of livestock and wildlife enabling rapid action to manage outbreaks."
