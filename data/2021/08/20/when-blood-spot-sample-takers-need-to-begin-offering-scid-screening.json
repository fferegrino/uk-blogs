But inevitably some samples will be delayed in transit, which means they could arrive in the laboratory on, or after, the 6 September 2021 and therefore will be tested for SCID. This is why we\u2019re asking blood spot sample takers to make sure that parents and carers are aware when taking consent from 27 August 2021."
