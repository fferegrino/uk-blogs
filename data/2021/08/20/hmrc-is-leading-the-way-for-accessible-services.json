Technology bridged many gaps that were left when face-to-face services had to be withdrawn. Many customers rely on digital services to meet their tax obligations. Our colleagues across HMRC also rely on technology to provide knowledgeable customer service whether they are working in the office or remotely from home. With so many people still choosing to access services digitally, the need for accessible digital services became more urgent than ever before."
