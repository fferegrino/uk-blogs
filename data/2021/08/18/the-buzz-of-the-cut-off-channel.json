            "text": "After 2 months of studying beekeeping books and woodworking plans, I set about building my first beehive using reclaimed materials from a recent building project. It took me a week to complete but within just a few days it attracted a swarm of wild bees! The sound was terrifying but within an hour they were all happily inside the hive with just a few buzzing about getting their bearings. I had learned that during this time the bees are relatively harmless as they have no young to protect and are only moving to a new home."

            "text": "*The cut-off channel is a key component of the Ely Ouse Flood Protection Scheme constructed in the 1950s-60s following devastating flooding of the Fens in both 1937 and 1947. It is a man-made channel that flows from Mildenhall, to convey flood waters from the River Lark, Little Ouse River and the River Wissey away from the South Level of the Great Ouse Fens. It connect with the Relief Channel at our Denver Complex and flood water is discharged to the Tidal River via Tail Sluice near King\u2019s Lynn. The Cut-Off Channel now also plays an important role in terms of public water supply in transferring water from the Ely Ouse to Essex. For more information on this and other Fens flood infrastructure please see our report available here."
