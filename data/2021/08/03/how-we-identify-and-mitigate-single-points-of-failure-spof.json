They are the ones you rely on to work late into the night on legacy technology, completing complex sequential releases that can take a whole weekend, the ones you ask to cram in what they can before they go on holiday. When they take time off your team stalls or has to divert focus elsewhere without their specialist knowledge. Even worse, when they leave, teams panic. They become completely blocked.\u00a0\u00a0"

In Organising for Digital Delivery, an independent report published in July this year, challenge 2 of 7 is \u201cUnaddressed legacy systems and technical debt.\u201d There is an increased likelihood of linchpins being present with legacy services because they are \u201cbuilt on obsolete technical platforms or using programming languages that are no longer widely supported.\u201d There are often expensive, siloed third parties involved, and an ever diminishing pool of people who understand the architecture and how your system works. This pattern isn\u2019t limited to older technology. If you aren\u2019t addressing linchpins in your delivery thinking your team can still be impacted, for example when the person who did all that great exploration work at the start of your service leaves."

If one person isn\u2019t around, and things start to fail or be delayed, that\u2019s a sign that a way of working needs to change. Another question to ask is are you mindful in sharing your way of working when insourcing help from third parties, or do they remain siloed on their particular outcome? The ecosystem around your team will thrive when connected and visible."

We iterate on this all the time by asking people what they want to see less or more of.\u00a0"

Perhaps you do this already, but how often? Create diverse pairings. Mixing juniors, seniors, permanent members of staff, contractors and managed service providers on rotation so people don\u2019t always pair with the same person each time will build further resilience into the team. Rotating people within a service, such as our hosting service team in the Ministry of Justice is another strategy we are exploring with success to share knowledge."
