We recognise there is an emerging market offering digital citizen engagement tools and services; these council-led funded projects will enable us to better understand the barriers to be overcome to allow local authorities to adopt these tools at scale."

Through the fund activities and projects supported, MHCLG will work with local authorities to help establish best practice and scope requirements for digital engagement guidance."

Local authorities will then be able to procure a supplier to work with on their engagement project, utilising the range of innovative tools that are available in the market. We will support local authorities to use G-Cloud or Spark DPS for procurement, with assistance for commercial teams as well."
