        {
            "text": "We went to these shows intending to talk about the changes coming in the farming sector, but just as importantly, to listen to concerns and learn from different experiences. Farmers and land managers, yes, but also agricultural businesses, campaigners, students, researchers, you name it."
        },

            "text": "As you'll know if you're a regular reader of this blog, our focus is on co-design. We're not making new policy for people, we're making it with people."
        },
        {
            "text": "So, listening to what people have to say is vital. The summer shows were a chance to listen, and pass on what we\u2019d heard to the right policy teams at Defra so those views become part of the policy design process."

            "text": "At some shows, we were joined by colleagues from the Rural Payments Agency and the Catchment Sensitive Farming team who were on hand with specific technical advice when it was needed. This worked really well, so we shall try to keep doing this at future shows."

            "text": "Some themes emerged from the conversations we had. This post is about what we heard, and how we're responding. We spoke to hundreds of people, and these are the themes and topics that seemed to strike a chord with most of them."

Some people joined workshops that we ran at shows, others signed up to join our co-design panel (a pool of people we can invite to take part in future co-design activities)."

            "text": "It helps us, too. We can be more transparent about work-in-progress, which means we get rapid feedback on what works and what doesn't. That helps us change plans faster and avoid taking wrong turns."

            "text": "People wanted more detail about transitioning from the existing Countryside Stewardship scheme to the Sustainable Farming Incentive - once it's fully up and running. The most common question was: \u201ccan I use Sustainable Farming Incentive and Countryside Stewardship together on my farm?\u201d And the answer is yes you can, but not on the same parcel of land, so people aren\u2019t getting rewarded twice for the same outcome."

This attracted interest and prompted questions about precise details. For example: if a member of a farmer's family takes over a farming business, does the parent still qualify for a lump sum payment? Does the new owner still qualify for our scheme for new entrants?"

            "text": "Avoiding this is a priority for us. We want to make the process of applying for support as simple as possible, so we're working hard to design something that meets the needs of the people who will end up using it."

            "text": "This wasn't a surprise to us, and of course \u00a0people need to know the granular detail. However, this is a 7 year transition and one that will see schemes come on stream over the next couple of years (as set out in both the Agricultural Transition Plan and the Farming Is Changing Leaflet), so we don\u2019t have all the detail for all of the schemes quite yet, as we\u2019re designing many of them with your input right now."
        },
        {
            "text": "But it was really useful to speak to people face-to-face, and understand their specific concerns, and why getting this level of detail in good time is really important. With that in mind, we\u2019ve been adding updates on this blog when we have detailed information to share. This is the most recent one, from a couple of weeks ago."
