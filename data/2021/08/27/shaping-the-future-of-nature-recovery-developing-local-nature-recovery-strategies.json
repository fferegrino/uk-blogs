Throughout, their fantastic interest and commitment has impressed, encouraged, reassured, and inspired me in equal measure."

            "text": "Their positive and consistent engagement to explore and challenge this new policy, sharing insights with us over the short nine months of the pilots\u2019 duration convinced me LNRSs are the natural next step in establishing a locally owned and strategic way to plan nature recovery. The more I understand about LNRSs the more significant, and game changing I think this legislation will be. This is the first time we are putting planning for nature recovery on a statutory footing! LNRSs will drive action for nature recovery to grow and develop our national Nature Recovery Network. This is our most important policy goal."

            "text": "Some people involved with biodiversity opportunity mapping felt the LNRS process was familiar. In some ways it is, but there are critical aspects that are different such as a broader focus to include wider environmental benefits and the collaborative and the community engagement aspects. Responsible Authorities (RAs) need to keep these differences central in their approach to putting an LNRS delivery team together making sure they line up the right skills and project management."

            "text": "Linking into existing networks reduces the need to build new relationships. This was particularly true where the Local Authority and Local Nature Partnerships have a good track record of collaboration. Again though, this new collaborative approach requires inclusion of the widest range of stakeholders. These include local rural and urban communities, the farming community, plus biodiversity and natural environment experts. LNRSs will link people to places and will investigate how the climate and biodiversity crises impacts them, enabling them to work together to explore priorities and agree what measures can be taken."

With the public consultation now open which will inform the regulations and statutory guidance, that will implement LNRS across England, we need people to think about what it will mean to our communities to plan strategically and collaboratively for nature recovery at such a scale and consistently across the whole of England. This includes thinking of LNRSs as a new way of working, that brings land use planning together with land management to drive action for nature recovery."

Please take this opportunity to respond and shape the future of nature recovery in this country."
