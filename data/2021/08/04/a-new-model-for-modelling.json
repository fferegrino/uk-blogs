            "text": "Last year, the global pandemic thrust the Office for Statistics Regulation into the limelight following a series of high profile uses of statistics for decision-making. One of the biggest pieces of work we did was our review of the approach to developing statistical models to award 2020 exam results. Algorithms were blamed, with one headline stating \u201cA-levels: 'Dreams ruined by an algorithm'\u201d (BBC Northern Ireland website)."

            "text": "We were concerned about the threat of undermining public confidence in statistical models more broadly. Our report looked at the 4 UK qualification regulators\u2019 use of algorithms through both social and technical viewpoints to investigate what went wrong in this scenario. We also looked at how statistical models can be used effectively going forwards."

            "text": "This work took us into new frontiers by commenting on the use of statistical models that influence public life, not just those that produce official statistics. We found there were significant challenges facing the qualification regulators in creating their statistical models."

        {
            "text": "One of the main findings was that the development of models which generate statistics or are used to inform decisions must adhere to the Code of Practice for Statistics to gain public acceptability and confidence. The 3 pillars of the code are Trustworthiness, Quality and Value."

These individuals were diverse in their experiences, roles, technical skills, and socio-economic backgrounds. It was extremely important that this group could help shape this guidance so that models work for all groups in society."
