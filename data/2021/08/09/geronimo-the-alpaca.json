Geronimo has been tested twice to this test and was positive on both occasions."

            "text": "This is not correct. The injection of tuberculin does not induce a false positive antibody response in animals that are not infected with bTB in the first place."

            "text": "The tuberculin skin test involves the injection of a very small dose (0.1ml) of a purified, sterile \u2018cocktail\u2019 of proteins extracted from dead bovine TB bacteria into an animal\u2019s skin. The tuberculin skin test itself has a very low sensitivity in camelids. Therefore, its main purpose is to boost the levels of specific antibodies generated by the animal\u2019s immune system against a pre-existing bTB infection, which might otherwise be below the detection threshold thereby producing a false-negative test result."

            "text": "The injection of tuberculin essentially amplifies the antibodies already induced by an existing infection. It does not trigger the production of a new antibody response in TB-free animals.\u00a0 It does not matter how often you repeat this procedure (i.e. the injection of tuberculin) in an animal prior to an antibody test for TB such as the Enferplex test. Tuberculin does not build up in an animal and if that animal has not been infected with bTB, there are no antibodies to boost in the first place."

            "text": "APHA routinely uses the \u2018boosted\u2019 Enferplex and other validated antibody tests in alpacas and llama herds that are not under movement restrictions, but which may be at risk of TB because they happen to be located near an infected cattle herd. Even in those at-risk herds we find very low proportions of positive results, approximately 1 to 3% on the \u2018boosted\u2019 antibody tests, which have been carried out in over 1,500 alpacas and llamas since 2019."

            "text": "The accuracy of the Enferplex and the other approved antibody tests for TB in camelids, including alpacas and llamas, were first estimated as part of a peer-reviewed study published in 2012 and were re-evaluated and updated by APHA in March 2018, based on the latest available data gathered. This included approximately 25% of our TB-free control group that had been subject to tuberculin \u2018priming\u2019 10-30 days before the blood samples were taken for antibody testing. The specificity figures quoted by the Environment Secretary therefore does include data from tuberculin primed camelids. It is the test that was requested by British Alpaca Society at the time."

For actiphage tests to work, it requires bovine TB bacteria to be circulating in an animal\u2019s blood, which doesn\u2019t necessarily happen until the advanced stages of TB. As mentioned above, the Enferplex test has been specifically developed and validated for alpacas and is the most accurate test."

Geronimo tested positive and had antibodies to four different types of the TB antigens in response to the TB bacterium."
