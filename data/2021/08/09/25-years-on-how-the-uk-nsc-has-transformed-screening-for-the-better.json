In this blog article to mark the committee\u2019s 25th anniversary, Dr Angela Raffle explains how the UK NSC has helped transform screening for the better from the \u2018bad old days\u2019 of haphazard, ineffective and harmful activities."

At medical school I\u2019d been taught that screening was very simple. All you needed to understand was sensitivity and specificity. Coffee-time conversations with Professor George Knox in the Birmingham public health department told a different story: evaluation and organisation were complex and essential, cervical screening was not yet living up to its promise, and screen-detected cytological abnormalities were far more common than the condition we were trying to prevent."

            "text": "I had worked with laboratory scientists and paediatricians in charge of newborn phenylketonuria screening, so had seen what good programme organisation could look like. I fully expected that once we\u2019d established a comprehensive call and recall system for cervical screening in Bristol then deaths from cervical cancer in our area would vanish. How wrong I was."

            "text": "The programme for the Bristol area was, thanks to the work of pathologist Dr Elisabeth Mackenzie, well ahead of the game. Soon we were calling up the entire eligible population, achieving very high uptake, using information for participants in 8 different languages, running a training school and an annual training event for everyone involved, achieving watertight follow-up and failsafe procedures, and meeting all quality standards, including for colposcopy and treatments."

            "text": "Yet we did not see the claimed 90 per cent drop in deaths that had supposedly been achieved in Iceland, parts of Scotland, and British Columbia. Not only that, but the numbers of screened women being referred for colposcopic investigation was enormously high, given that cervical cancer in the UK had been an uncommon and declining cause of death even before screening began \u2013 on a par with oral cancer."

            "text": "It was then I began properly delving into the world literature. This was a sobering experience. The scientific quality of most of the papers claiming to show benefit from screening was appalling. Attention to the full consequences of screening, including all the unintended consequences, was virtually non-existent. The notion that it is unethical to blunder into the life of a healthy person to tell them, on the basis of no evidence at all, that a likely innocent and transient condition is in your view serious and \u2018needs\u2019 potentially harmful treatment, seemed to be lost on almost everyone."

            "text": "It struck me that the number of people who really understood the complexities of screening was very small, and the evangelical tone of the discourse surrounding screening at that time meant anyone who spoke honestly risked being branded an \u2018anti-screener\u2019. Many times when speaking at meetings or conferences I was told: \u201cWhat you say is true but you must not say it because it will undermine the programme\u201d. My reply was always:"

            "text": "What happened next was important. Across the UK, those of us closely involved in cervical screening began to meet up, share experiences and share data. Muir Gray led this \u2018network\u2019, bringing an important culture of openness and integrity. Once cervical screening was on the right track Muir then took the lead on rolling out the Forrest Committee recommendations on breast screening."

            "text": "After that, the contrast between the quality-assured national programmes and the hundreds of haphazard, ineffective and harmful opportunistic screening activities taking place unofficially, became too stark to ignore. This enabled the successful establishment in 1996 of the UK NSC. Step by step this transformed, for the better, the policy-making, research, quality of delivery, and user involvement."

            "text": "Attempts to ignore or distort the science and the potential consequences or harms of screening are ever present. Some of these attempts are simply motivated by a well-intentioned belief that early detection must always be right."

This is where I have focused my effort throughout my career both locally and nationally; through research, face to face teaching, working with the media, producing online learning materials, and through publication of our book Screening: evidence and practice1 (now in its second edition)."
