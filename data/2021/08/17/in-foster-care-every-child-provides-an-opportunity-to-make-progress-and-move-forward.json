Denise is a Fostering Social Worker at Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council where Helen and her partner Steve are foster carers. In this blog, the pair reflect on what they\u2019ve learnt over the years and the qualities that make a great foster carer."

We made the decision to adopt a family member 20 odd years ago. After this, I eventually got to the point where I wanted to do something more, but it needed to be the right time for my son. When he reached 15, we started fostering and we haven\u2019t stopped since!"

We\u2019ve had a young lady on a Special Guardianship Order for 9 years and have adopted a little boy who was placed with us when he was 6 months old; he has some additional needs and complex health issues. Currently, my husband and I have these 2 children with us and another little one on a short-term placement (15 months so far)."

With 5 years' experience in safeguarding, I went into fostering to supervise social workers. I then managed a Children In Our Care team before returning to fostering as a team manager. After 5 years as a manager, I found I missed visiting families, so 2 years ago I became a supervising social worker once again. I\u2019ll be ready to retire in 3 years' time!"

Foster carers need to be open-minded and prepared for the potential needs of the children coming into their care - it can be a shock. It\u2019s all-consuming but the rewards are huge. The difference you see in children, from the time they come into your care to when they move on, makes it all worthwhile."

Sometimes it\u2019s a breeze but when things are more challenging, it\u2019s so important to know your social worker is there for you. Denise is always available at the end of the phone. If we have any problems or concerns, we can go to her. If she\u2019s away, she\u2019ll leave another point of contact so we always have someone to go to for support."

We hold monthly supervisions where we use the Signs of Safety approach to understand what is working well and what needs to happen. We also connect foster carers through buddying. Helen provides guidance to less experienced carers and the council organises support groups with guest speakers. There is also the Foster Care Training Hub where we recently held a trauma-informed training session. 80% of foster carers turned up; there were 158 people in total including social workers and those who work in schools."

I\u2019ve researched PACE (Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy) training and recently learned more about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder - another area of special interest for me as it impacts one of our boys. You need to have the understanding to support any child that comes into your home."

With Helen\u2019s nature being so therapeutic, the children wouldn\u2019t be as well off without her."

On difficult days, you have to remind yourself that they are in this situation through no fault of their own. It\u2019s not personal if they\u2019re having a difficult day. If you lose sight of that, you need to have a hard think about whether you should still be doing what you\u2019re doing."

When I\u2019m with a child who has particular needs, I want to learn why they behave the way they do. I wonder, \u201cWhat\u2019s the science behind that?\u201d It\u2019s because of this that my collection of books is getting bigger and bigger!"
