            "text": "I have been doing this role for 20 years now and over that time, the cleanliness of our beaches has improved. However, two of the problems that I see far too often are litter and dog mess. It only takes two minutes to dispose of your litter or take it home with you and just one teaspoon of dog poo can have a nasty impact on the bathing water quality."

This data is uploaded onto our Swimfo website, which allows you to check the quality of over 400 designated bathing waters before you decide to go for a swim."

We test the water for two types of harmful bacteria \u2013 E. coli and Intestinal Enterococci. You can read more about this and the role DNA testing has in sampling in our earlier blog."
