It is one of the most significant animal health challenges that England faces today, costing taxpayers more than \u00a3100 million each year. In 2020 alone, more than 27,000 cattle had to be slaughtered to curb its spread."

            "text": "In cattle, TB is primarily a chronic respiratory disease but clinical signs are rare. Bovine TB is a zoonotic disease, which means that it can be naturally transmitted from animals to humans under certain conditions. Due to the comprehensive TB eradication plan in place in the UK, human cases of TB have been significantly reduced over recent decades."

            "text": "The UK enjoys a hard-won international reputation for biosecurity and our standards are second to none. Our strict animal disease control strategies are central to this. Restrictions on livestock movements are taken to reduce the risk of the spread of diseases which can have damaging effects on farmers\u2019 livelihoods and income and even affect the UK\u2019s ability to trade in certain products."

        {
            "text": "Alongside strong biosecurity measures, routine TB testing of cattle herds is a key tool in our approach to stopping this disease. The primary testing method is the tuberculin skin test, which is widely used around the world to detect the disease in animals. The test has a specificity of 99.98%, meaning on average there is one false positive result for every 5,000 uninfected cattle tested."
