In some cases, results will have been decided using teacher-assessed grades, like those used for A levels and GCSEs. Others will have been determined using normal assessment routes. And others will have been determined through adapted assessments, such as remote invigilation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

VTQ qualifications already have a high proportion of internal assessment built in and awarding organisations must have robust systems and processes in place to ensure the results they issue are correct. This means that employers and educators can be confident in the results, which reflect what learners know and what they can do."

This was during a time of delayed assessments, centre closures and furloughed staff. It is an incredible achievement. Data from awarding organisations, which covers the last 4 years, shows there has been no significant change to numbers of learners taking VTQs.\u00a0\u00a0"
