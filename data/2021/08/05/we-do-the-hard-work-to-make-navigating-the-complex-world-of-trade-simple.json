Four and a half years later, the platform is now in a completely different place."

We will do this by building a frictionless and compelling platform, which reassures, educates, and simplifies trade with the rest of the world."

The platform started off as a promotional website consisting of a disconnected set of services, reflecting organisational structure, instead of user needs. Over time, we realigned all services according to user needs, under a unified architecture. We use microservices for common functionality (for example Single Sign On and Forms data lake) and larger building blocks for underlying infrastructure like Wagtail CMS."

As the platform\u2019s Technical Architect, I had the chance to collaborate with colleagues from the big four technology companies on solving some of the toughest challenges around trade and investment. When we needed to build trailblazing personalisation capability on the GREAT platform, Google and their UK technology partner CTS helped us design a solution using BigQuery and Google Analytics 360."

We can make these happen because we solve big problems, with a drive and urgency to innovate and consistently deliver based on modern development practices. We follow the GDS Service Standard such as using code in the open and use agile ways of working."

When the first Covid-19 lockdown was announced we shifted to full time remote working overnight. Thanks to our outstanding infrastructure, we were already prepared to work from home and didn\u2019t face any issue from the technology side. Actually, DIT\u2019s Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) culture was already embracing working remotely meaning that we already had the right technology to support working from home."

            "text": "By working from home, we can work on tasks that require deep focus. However, always working remotely means that you need to bring the entire office life to your home. On top of this, we also had to hire most of the technical members of staff, remotely, without ever meeting them in person."
        },
        {
            "text": "To meet these challenges, I started by writing our team's \u2018remote working manifesto'. A set of clear, simple and easy to follow rules that would serve as the guideline for the months to come. We operate on trust, we are contactable and respect work life boundaries, we work as a team and help each other to upskill and resolve blockers as a priority. We don\u2019t blame, but learn from our mistakes, optimising our process for the future."

            "text": "To support our remote working, I established weekly 15 minute 1-2-1 meetings with every member of the team, and even reached out to people from different teams to have the quick 'watercooler chat\u2019 that we could no longer have. But quick chats in the hallway turned into meetings, which turned into frequent breaks for the developers that couldn\u2019t allow them to \u2018get into the zone\u2019."

            "text": "Over time we balanced that with a few adjustments. Meetings now have mandatory and optional participants, and we may post keynotes after the meeting for the wider team. Members of technical staff can also block out time for deep focus. We started using tools to achieve these goals, such as Microsoft Teams, Invision Freehand, Google Suite and Microsoft Office to better collaborate in the new, digital-only work world."

It supports our learning and development and provides us with a chance to take a break and socialise with new people."

We are now able to attract top talent to support our vision through the new ways of working we have embraced."
