It\u2019s a regional partnership that was set up in 2012 and has had major success in meeting the standards of the Bathing Waters Directive, with all bathing waters along the North West coast, from the border with Wales to the border with Scotland, achieving at least the minimum standard of Sufficient since 2016. There are a number of organisations involved including the Environment Agency, United Utilities, Natural England, local authorities, beach operators, British Destinations, NFU and the North West Coastal Forum, each bringing their own unique contribution to the partnership."

This has really helped the partnership to evolve and broaden out ambitions where previously the focus was on striving to meet the bathing water standards.\u00a0The benefits of peoples\u2019 health and wellbeing, as well as the boost for tourism, go hand in hand with a high-quality natural resource and these are now reflected in the partnership\u2019s 10-year action plan. The ultimate goal of the action plan is to have a \u2018Blue Flag Coast\u2019 (with Blue Flags flying at many of the North West\u2019s Bathing Waters) and to set the partnership as a leader in bathing water improvements and engagement regionally, nationally and across Europe."
