Commercial innovation and design approaches, much lauded in MBAs and tech start ups, are developed to extract value from markets and drive to the bottom line. They are tuned to create highly effective mechanisms for solving problems like persuading you to spend money. In contrast, the government addresses the great challenges of our time. These are complex or wicked problems that feature ever-changing public interests and infrastructure, and deep ethical dilemmas. Public design teams give the government the tools for navigating complexity and reducing uncertainty. Their work helps the government to safeguard the equity share that we choose as a society by ensuring that everyone who should have access to decent public services, does have access. Public design teams don\u2019t extract value, they make value."

They incorporate subject matter experts who have deep domain knowledge on issues of national importance with technical experts who have skills like research, design and delivery. It is essential to create a feedback loop between policymakers and people that use public services, and the operational delivery professionals, who work on the frontline of government, are key to making this happen. Design teams  collaborate using techniques like systems thinking, people centred design, behavioural science, agile project management, participative co-design and experimentation. The Institute for Government says, \u201cmore multi-disciplinary teams are needed to improve decisions and services ...specialists need to be better incorporated into policy making at each stage of the process, to ensure that a wide range of skills inform policy design from the start.\u201d"

People expect as little friction as possible when engaging with the government. Where services are too complex to understand and navigate, a common human response is to avoid them. For some people, this reduces fair access to public services and consequently reduces the efficacy of government\u2019s levers for affecting change in the world. So it is crucial for us to reduce the cost of citizens and the government working together to develop and use public services, whether those are financial, time or opportunity costs."

But it might also mean us gaining a deeper understanding of what people need and how different people in society experience public services, so that we can design them in a way that safeguards fair access for everyone. The National Audit Office emphasises the importance of design for stewarding value for citizens and notes that more than two-thirds of public services do not know precisely what their users need.\u00a0"

The more that policymakers and citizens work together to make public policies and services, the more transparency and trust there is in society, which improves everyone\u2019s wellbeing and delivers on this social contract. What Works Wellbeing say, \u201cPersonal agency, power, responsibility and control are a part of our wellbeing: freedom to choose what we do in our life is the second biggest driver of wellbeing.

This evidence base is used to design interventions that respond to the deep context that is revealed, and understanding is further enhanced\u00a0 by testing and iterating the policy or service with the people that will use it.
