We should also be proud and very grateful that, unlike many parts of the world, all children in the UK can get free vaccines to protect them against a host of other serious diseases, from measles to polio."

Exactly why this happened is not entirely clear and there will have been a number of factors at play, including access to health services. Some parents however will simply not be aware of the vaccinations their child is entitled to."

It is absolutely vital that parents bring their children to all their routine vaccination appointments and catch up on any vaccinations they have missed. Vaccinations can be rescheduled and every child is still entitled to their jab, even if they have missed an appointment."
