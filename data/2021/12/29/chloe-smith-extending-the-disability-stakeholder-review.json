A better understanding of disabled people and their issues is central to the successful delivery of the National Disability Strategy and further work in the future. Ensuring the voice of disabled people is properly heard is an important part of that. I am very conscious that we should be working more closely with disabled people\u2019s organisations; that there are gaps in our knowledge of the size and makeup of the disability sector and that we are not always\u00a0 hearing from the full diversity of the community.\u00a0\u00a0"

They will be mapping the disability sector, looking at examples of best practice across the world and speaking to disabled people, DPOs and other organisations through a programme of events. They have started work on delivery of the first two workstreams and are developing\u00a0 the events programme in collaboration with DPOs.\u00a0"

Our own preference is that we would rather take more time to get things right and this view has been supported by the DPOs and charities that we have been working with on the review. Having more space for better collaboration with DPOs and a wider and more diverse range of\u00a0 conversations from right across the disabled community will ensure richer findings and more informed outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0"
