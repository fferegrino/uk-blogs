As 2021 draws to a close, it\u2019s a good chance to look back on what\u2019s happened since then and to look forward to more people putting down roots with woodland creation in 2022."

We were lucky that the summer brought new recruits to help implement the Programme, boosting our numbers and our energy as we all moved firmly into \u2018delivery\u2019 mode. That\u2019s involved launching new grants and announcing new policies, along with Forestry Commission and Natural England advisors helping landowners and managers to start taking up the England Woodland Creation Offer."

This saw a commitment to create 500ha of woodland by 2025 with a further 1100ha by 2034, backed by a first-year funding boost of \u00a3480,000. Community Forests bring community focused planting to areas that are in most need of the support."

The plans to help the area build back greener are exciting, with the equivalent of one tree planted for every resident in Copeland, Barrow and Allerdale over the next five years and a longer-term goal of over 5,000ha to be crated over the next 25 years."

On the one hand, there was lots of policy development work on implementation of the ETAP, including on how we will seamlessly transition from NCF into environmental land management schemes. On the other hand there was lots of preparation work for the early autumn delivery announcements which came thick and fast."

England has over 242,000km of watercourses. Incentivising farmers and other landowners and managers to protect trees and increase planting along these brings a wide range of benefits, from a reducing flood risk, to connecting woodlands and boosting biodiversity."

Other regional action, supported by Defra, came in the shape of the White Rose Forest announcing their Action Plan for tree planting and woodlands, and the Great Northumberland Forest announcing their wider engagement with landowners and farmers to help develop the area and increase woodland."

This signals widespread support for our work to get more trees in the ground."

This showed what a key role trees, woodland and forests play in our lives. Forest Research found that the UK\u2019s woodlands boost mental health and could save up to \u00a3185 million per year in treatment costs."

As we move into the Jubilee year we encourage everyone to get involved and register their trees to the map on The Queen\u2019s Green Canopy website."
