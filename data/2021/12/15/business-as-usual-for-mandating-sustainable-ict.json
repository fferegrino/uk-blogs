With reporting fixed, we had to focus on a change to how government designs and delivers ICT. One of the key mechanisms for this is the Cabinet Office/Government Digital Service managed Technology Code of Practice. This now includes a new point twelve \u2013\u2018Make your technology sustainable\u2019 - which is all about increasing sustainability throughout the lifecycle of your technology."

If you don't, then you will not pass."

The more sustainable the solution, the easier it will be to pass spend controls. And at the end of the year, you can report all the good work in the updated GGCs."
