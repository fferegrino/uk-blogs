It is the start of a new contract to provide what are called \u2018hard\u2019 facilities management services to some of the MOD Built Estate. These include building maintenance, repairs, servicing, plumbing, heating, fire safety systems and more.\u00a0"

The team at Mitie have spent the intervening time familiarising themselves with the estate and its condition and ensuring that they are ready to hit the ground running today. They will be responsible for around 95 sites, including RAF Lossiemouth, HMNB Clyde and Glencorse Barracks in Scotland and Joint Helicopter Command Flying Station Aldergrove and Thiepval Barracks in Northern Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
