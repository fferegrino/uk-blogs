I was a steward for the day, making sure people were in the right place to receive their vaccine. The whole experience was very rewarding, I got to meet so many people and discuss what getting the vaccine meant to them. I would highly recommend volunteering for a cause you care about and using your volunteering days.\u201d Millie Martin, Engagement and Strategic Adoption team"

The conservation work involved a day of litter picking and raking mown areas to encourage meadow development. I would recommend it to anybody wanting to do a volunteer day outdoors. It's a complete change to working in an office (or at home). You're also helping to maintain an outdoor area which is used by many people for walking, cycling, and sports. It was great to get outdoors and the work itself was better than a gym workout!\u201d Julie Fenn, Live Services team"
