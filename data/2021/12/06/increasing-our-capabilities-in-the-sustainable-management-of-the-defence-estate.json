In working towards these goals, we will make a major contribution towards meeting MOD and UK government sustainability targets, such as achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."

The expansion of our capabilities in the area of sustainability is also vital to DIO\u2019s continued stewardship of the many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Ramsar sites and other important natural assets across the UK Defence Training Estate which we have a duty to maintain."

All such work must be carried out in balance with the primary purpose of the Defence estate, which is to enable military training."
