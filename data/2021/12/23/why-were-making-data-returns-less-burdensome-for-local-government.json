There\u2019s an official list of these obligatory data submissions called the Single Data List. As you\u2019ll see DLUHC (formerly MHCLG) owns many of them."

However, there are surprisingly few APIs to automate the transfer of this data between local organisations\u2019 systems and central government."

These are known as \u2018new burdens\u2019, which are carefully assessed, and sometimes reimbursed. But extra money doesn\u2019t always make things faster for already time-poor data providers who could always be spending more time out with communities. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make the data quality better either."

But they don\u2019t cover the entire provider base, and not all local authorities and housing associations have budgets or the digital maturity to submit via API. So, while we will be enabling submission via API, it\u2019s going to be a while before the benefits of that reach all data providers."
