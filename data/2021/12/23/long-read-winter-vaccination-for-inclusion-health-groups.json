A booster programme has also begun to offer additional protection to those most at risk and people aged over 16 with a third dose given 3 months after the second\u00a0dose. Flu vaccination involves a single dose and may be given at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccination, which avoids any further delay in protection and the risk of the person not returning for a later appointment. Although a large proportion of the adult population have taken up the COVID-19 vaccination offer, not everyone has received their first dose yet. The offer of vaccination remains open to everyone who is eligible, wherever they are on their vaccination journey. Vaccination can be offered to people without an NHS number, and those who are not registered with a GP should not be turned away when trying to access vaccination."
