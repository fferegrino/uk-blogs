To explain the changes, we issued a clear, parent-friendly outline of our new policies to all parents, including our expectations of them. At parents\u2019 evening, we began sharing detailed individual pupil attendance data and helped parents understand what percentages of absence meant for education time lost in real-terms and produced a \u2018minutes late\u2019 report so parents could understand the cumulative impact of their child being late. Parents of pupils who were persistently absent or late were offered support by our Family Support Worker to find ways to improve their attendance."

These surgeries were an open discussion with parents to talk about reasons for absence and ways that we could support their child to attend more frequently. The surgeries were well attended, and we found some pupils\u2019 attendance improved from just receiving the invite. We also invited feedback from parents about how our school had been managing attendance and how we could support them to ensure their child regularly attends school."

We have a mainly non-teaching pastoral team who work directly with the families of pupils who do not attend regularly to understand the root causes of absence. One of our catchment areas is an area of high deprivation so we also support families by linking them with advocates and agencies that can coach and support them to access funding and support for their families. This fosters positive relationships with parents and means that they know we are prioritising the best interest of our pupils and their families."

For example, if a parent says their child feels anxious about attending school we may refer them to small group sessions or school counselling. This ensures all pupils and families are being offered consistent support across the board."

We track dips in individual pupil\u2019s daily attendance, and our assistant headteacher, attendance officer and education welfare officer meet weekly to review every pupil\u2019s attendance. This enables us to spot patterns in attendance behaviour and proactively identify pupils before they become \u2013 or risk becoming \u2013 persistently absent. These pupils are targeted for mentoring, incentivised rewards, additional home contact and 1-1 support to prevent any more absences."

This allows us to build a clear picture of any barriers to learning and attendance pupils may have and ensure that the transition does not result in a continued absence. To do this, the key attendance, SEND, pastoral, safeguarding and inclusion staff meet with all relevant primary schools to identify any information which may impact on school attendance, and identify appropriate interventions to support and maintain positive attendance from the start of term. Where necessary, we organise additional transition meetings and school visits so that pupils feel supported and to address any anxieties. As soon as the new academic year begins, we closely monitor the first few terms to understand their attendance behaviour and how they are adjusting to the new environment."
