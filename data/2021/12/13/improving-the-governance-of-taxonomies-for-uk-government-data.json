This may sound a little complicated, so hopefully this blog will provide more clarity on what the group is and what it aims to do."

Examples of this are the UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) or the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), which has nine groups of occupations from managers, directors and senior officials to elementary occupations, each with their own sub-groups. Taxonomies can also be flat. In this sense, they may be code lists such as gender."
