That\u2019s why I\u2019m delighted at least \u00a3500 million of the \u00a31.7 billion announced will be used to transform the way we support, sustain and develop the workforce. Much of this support will be focused on levelling up the knowledge, skills and experience of care colleagues across the sector."

            "text": "Indeed, RMs are arguably the backbone of the social care system and undoubtedly proved their worth during the pandemic. The more we can do to support them with the best training and workplace resources, especially during their first year in post, the more they can do for the teams they lead. In this respect, they are critical to mobilising and leading the reform agenda in the workforce."

            "text": "Care certificates, for example, will create a new delivery standard recognised across the sector, which will facilitate more rewarding career paths for all colleagues and make sure there is a knowledge baseline for every care role. The new delivery standards will also mean these certificates are portable, allowing new and existing staff to move roles with greater ease without the need to repeat training. These changes will mean care certificates will form part of a robust induction programme for those new to social care and offer a clear demonstration they have the skills needed to deliver great care."

Social care is such a broad church of talents, it is essential we level up with NHS colleagues and ensure equal access to learning and development."

You can read more about this aspect of reform in the Chief Social Worker for Adults, Lyn Romeo\u2019s latest blog."
