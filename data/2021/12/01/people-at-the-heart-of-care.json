In developing this landmark document, we have engaged with hundreds of diverse organisations and individuals from across the social care sector, including those with lived experience of providing and drawing upon care and support."

When I\u2019ve attended visits, I\u2019ve seen the amazing work of care colleagues first hand \u2013 and I am always bowled over by their compassion, skills and dedication to caring for others."

Government is also funding initiatives to provide more wellbeing and mental health support and to improve access to occupational health."
