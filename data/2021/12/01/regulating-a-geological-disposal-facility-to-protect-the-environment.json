Government policy\u00a0is that geological disposal is the best available approach for managing higher activity waste in the long term. A consent-based process to find a location for a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) in England and Wales has started. The process is initially community-led, with a partnership approach between local communities and the developer, Radioactive Waste Management. Support from a host community is required before construction starts."

However, further work is required for RWM to establish itself as an organisation suitable to hold an environmental permit."
