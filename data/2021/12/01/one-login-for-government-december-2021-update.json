We\u2019ll be providing users with greater control over what personal data they choose to share and how that data will be used.

Right now we\u2019re focussed on a near term set of things we need to have as core foundational blocks that will enable the next financial year to be a big digital delivery year for us. I can\u2019t wait to cross the line at a canter (perhaps even a gallop) and get our products into the hands of real users. Exciting times!"
