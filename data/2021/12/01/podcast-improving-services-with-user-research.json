And then the skill of the user researcher lies in selecting the most appropriate research methodology to answer the research question. So for example, if the research question was about information architecture, we might use something like a card sort. Whereas if the research question concerned usability of a digital product, for example, we might use usability testing as our methodology. We also focus a lot on making sure the data collected are not skewed, for example, we wouldn't want a researcher asking leading questions. And we need to remain very open to finding out things that are not already on our agenda. And in a nutshell, I guess this is all about making sure the research is really robust and so the evidence that we gather is sound."

            "text": "The full range of user research methodologies can be, broadly speaking, categorised against two what we probably call continuums. So one of these is attitudinal versus behavioural, which simply means does the methodology provide insight about what the user actually does, which is their behaviour of course, or what they say they do, which is their attitude. And again, generally speaking, behavioural insight is considered of higher value. Because what people say they do is not always what they actually do when we want the real behaviours of our users. The other metric or continuum is qualitative versus quantitative. And this describes of course, whether the research data collected are numerical or not. So for example, something like the time users spend on a screen is very much quantitative, whereas something like their trust of government is rich, qualitative data. And because quantitative data tell us what people do, whereas quali data tells us why people do it, we wouldn't think about one of these as being better than the other. But we would need to look to use both in order to triangulate and collect the full picture."

            "text": "And I think the point that Sheena makes there at the end around triangulating in on Insights is very important. I think, certainly, from my perspective, when I look at making decisions around a product or service, if several methodologies have been used across a range of sort of qualitative and quantitative data points, it's really powerful, because then I can say, \u201cLook, we've seen users tell us this in say qualitative interviews. We've got some data from, say, Google Analytics that speaks to that trend that was observed in research. And we've also confirmed it via a survey or something like that.\u201d"

So, methodologies like one on one interviews, retrospective interviews, understanding methodologies around usability testing with various participants of research. So very much like the qual, from a qual perspective, what's really important as Malcolm referenced, as well as a mixture of those methodologies. And from a quantitative perspective, it's in relation to the numbers and the volumes, and that's given us the, the what, and that generally feeds in to the why. So, if we've got a lot of what, from the quant side of things, as a researcher, I have a real interest in that, because it also helps me in the planning of future research and focus on the qual perspective in terms of the methodology that we're utilising as well."

            "text": "So, projects have stages from discovery through alpha and beta to live. And the aims of our user research in each of these project phases are different. Thus, the types of research we do in each phase will differ. Commonly, discovery would entail gathering contextual data via something like depth interviewing. And being contextual, this user research is ideally face-to-face in the person's real environment. So that might be their workplace or their home but not in in a laboratory setting. We do sometimes conduct group research but the downside of this is that the voice of quieter personalities can be lost. So I'd say the overall the specifics of the research approach must best suit the methodology, the research question, and of course, the phase of the project."

            "text": "Just with that in mind, and what Sheena\u2019s mentioned there. In terms of like user research and research being conducted across teams, we are always looking to discover things. So as the discovery moves into an alpha, and as that alpha moves into a private beta, private beta into public beta, there's a continuous interest from our perspective and from the teams that we're working within, to learn about the users, to learn about the participants research. So just because we've come out of a discovery phase, where we're gathering a lot of insight in relation to the participants of the research, identifying our users, what the problems are that they experience and identify at that stage in the Agile sort of phase of development, as we progress through an alpha and into the beta stage as well, just because we're testing different prototypes, different approaches, we're still learning about things."

            "text": "I think I'd just add that we have different questions that we that we ask at different stages of the project lifecycle. And it's about sort of horses for courses, and the questions we have at the very beginning in discovery and we need answers on might be quite ill defined, might be quite nebulous, might be quite broad. Whereas as we progress throughout those different phases, the questions may well become very specific, in order for us to make very clear decisions about the direction of a product as well. And so, inherently the research needs to sort of adapt and change using different methodologies, and doing different things as our needs change as a sort of a product team or a service team as well, just to give us that sort of just enough research to make the next decisions that we need to make and do what we need to do, given where the project is at."

        {
            "text": "So I think predominantly, for me, this is around in the first instance, the researcher being that sort of representative of their own research within the teams. So having strong communication skills to gather the data, whether it's behavioural, whether it's sort of quantitative, engage with it critically, synthesise it into a sort of a clear and concise set of insights or a clear story that they can feed back to the team."

What are the implications of that either for the direction of the service, for decisions about design, for decisions about what we might be doing in terms of a technical direction, and what we might need a product or service to do."
        },
        {
            "text": "So I think the role of the researcher is being that conduit, but in terms of how does it impact the team, it's very much a sort of a team effort that everyone has bought into, and is actively engaging with the story that the research is telling us. And for some of the things that you might learn in the discovery phase, it's more about immersing yourself in that understanding of your users. Once you get to the stage of say a public beta, when you've got really robust KPIs and analytics, it might be that we can make some really fast decisions based on a few key data points that we thoroughly understand and given the thorough immersion we have in understanding the needs and situation of our users, we feel very confident to make that decision quickly."
        },
        {
            "text": "But again, it's a conversation, I think these things work best when they're sort of collective. Although, obviously, as I've mentioned I think the researcher plays a key role in sort of bringing that back to the team and being that representative in the team. I think we've all worked in teams where the ideal isn't the case, and where the researcher needs to be very forthright about presenting and forwarding the needs of the user and that team. So it's not to diminish the role, but it's very much a sort of a team effort to turn the insights into realities of strategy, vision, design, and what we eventually build."

So what happens in the lives of users, what they struggle with and why."

So where we kind of plot the interactions with a service from a user's perspective along a timeline, and kind of aggregating some of the research insights into pain points and behavior and emotional responses to those scenarios in that single artefact can be really useful and powerful to getting those messages across. And I think these artefacts as well, just touching on the stuff that Chris was saying earlier about as we continue to learn, these artefacts can be living documents that we continue to add to and can keep constantly referring to when we're presenting back the insights."

That can be very helpful in telling the story of our research and supporting the vision that we have for a service. We can do a great deal of stakeholder engagement, including getting stakeholders and even ministers along to research to hear firsthand what our users are telling us. And obviously, as we progress throughout the phases, we can we can solicit regular feedback, making sure we're regularly inspecting and adapting the service based on the sort of the continual findings that we're getting from user research, performance analysis, and usability testing and a range of other things that we're actively doing."

That lends more weight to this or that being a more valuable thing to do.\u201d Especially when I'm making decisions about roadmaps and to do this, before I do that questions of value are heavily informed by what the research is telling me, as we live in an imperfect world, certainly within government, where by no means do we have all the data and hard evidence that we might want."

And we are constantly making decisions with an imperfect or incomplete picture. And we do the best we can, which is why we you know, as best as to as great an extent as we can, we need to come back to that point that we raised with the very first question of triangulating our insights across a range of methodologies wherever possible, so that we can make sure that we're making as robust decisions as we can be, without letting the perfect be the enemy of the good here."

And we can come back and fix them if we break them. And all the decisions we make will not be perfect, because user research isn't perfect, nor is performance analysis. You know, we will make imperfect research but we will do the best we can and gather as much insight as we can to make sure that we make as few of those wrong or imperfect decisions for users as possible."

Because let's face it, we operate in, especially within government, in a complex landscape where realistically, an individual team does not have the autonomy to do whatever their research may or may not be telling them to do. There are a lot of people that we need to convince that this is the approach we should be taking for this service. And so research plays a really key role in that process."

If they\u2019re based on actual evidence from research, if it lacks in sort of assumption based because they're things that we think are going to happen and we\u2019re building services based on assumptions, then it's obviously a little bit more concerning because it's not us that are using the services at the end of the day. It's the actual users, it\u2019s citizens in this aspect as the primary user. So, if we\u2019re basing the things that we're producing, so the profiles that we're creating, the artefacts and the visuals that are being created on the back of actual user research that's conducted. And how we communicate those effectively, is an important aspect of that. And if we're doing that in the right way, then we're feeding the teams with the relevant insights. And we're using the datasets, we're using the models we use and the user profiles with research in mind in the right way. And that's allowing us to make effective decisions on the services that we build, and building those services across channels. So it's not just about the digital services that we're building. It's understanding what the needs are from the users that we are engaging with as part of research and building a journey that satisfies and meets those needs."

And that can have an influence ultimately on how well people are able to tell the story, how well they're able to evidence their research as well.

I think certainly from hearing stories that have been shared with me around experience of working in various sort of private sector roles. While they might have a degree of freedom, they are also under significant pressures in very different ways that we are in government.

Because as people may have already heard, user research being a team sport, and it's always referenced, but it is that in terms of right, the user researcher\u2019s a professional within that role.

If you're in a private beta, if you're in a public beta phase, if you're even in a live phase, there's always an opportunity to learn from the users and from the users that you've identified. And as a researcher, progressing through discovery into alpha into beta, running blended sessions, so if you're running usability sessions in an alpha, making sure that you're involving some sort of interview technique in those sessions to learn from those users, is still massively important and can provide real insight into the work that you're doing to the research that you're doing."

So, making sure people are involved in the research and again, having confidence in the stuff that you're doing with research in mind. The next point and a couple more. So collaboration is really important as part of research, so collaborating amongst a team, collaborating in the wider UR community. So wider URs in terms of across like, as an example, health and disability. We've got a community within health and disability. So, making sure that we collaborate across the different researchers is really important as well. So, we're sharing learnings, we\u2019re sharing experiences across all of the teams, across all of the roles and basically just collaborate and wider and as wide as we possibly can based on the user groups that you are researching with."

Bringing that back into the department, bringing that back into the teams, go into the likes of show and tells with your research, and then attending assessments. So, service standard assessments where you're basically showcasing the research that you've done, that you have confidence in your user groups, that you have confidence in the needs that you've identified and the artefacts that you've created. Being able to tell that story with the research in mind helps people understand the problem that you're trying to solve, but also is really important in relation to the research that's been conducted and the outputs and artefacts that have been created. So how you got to those outputs and artefacts, how you've created, for example, your user needs that are visible, how you've sort of fed into the user experience maps or the user journeys that you've created, how you've contributed and fed into your user profiles or your personas that have been created.

And I don't think we'll be the only department learning within s the user research field and how that is effectively integrated into the work that we do. How we utilise research positively, and we're getting the messages across and as I've mentioned on previous questions around getting those insights back into the department and acting on those insights as well."

I mentioned the discovery piece in relation to understanding citizens\u2019 goals and needs and creating artefacts on the back of that. So that's just one example in terms of the development and the progress that we're making with research in mind. As a researcher, I always see the value in championing the actual research role and the value of research and what that brings into the teams. Embedding that into the teams as well so that research is occurring naturally, insights are being acted upon. Ensuring that research is happening on a regular basis, that all the teams and researchers have focus on the end users and those primary users being citizens."

And when refer to other users, it\u2019s around third party organisations that we know have a heavy involvement around health benefits and that\u2019s come through research. Internal DWP staff, so all of our internal staff that are involved in the touch points from a citizen\u2019s perspective, are involved in getting the decision to the citizens. And all of that in terms of the multitude of users and making sure that we are involving users in the research that we're conducting. All important in relation to the approach that we take."

And in my case, in relation to the work that's been done in health and disability, the experiences and the positive experiences that citizens have in the longer term with the benefits and with the engagement that they have with DWP in an organisation, for me would be fantastic if we can get to that point at some point in the future."
