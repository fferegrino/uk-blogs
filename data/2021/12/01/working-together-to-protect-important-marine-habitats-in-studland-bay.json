Anchors from recreational boats can damage seagrass fronds and roots when they embed into the seabed. Dragging an anchor can uproot seagrass and anchor chains can scrape the seabed.\u00a0The\u00a0seagrass beds\u00a0in the area\u00a0are home to a protected species of seahorse and other wildlife as well as important fish stocks.\u00a0Seagrass beds\u00a0also\u00a0provide\u00a0a number of\u00a0vital ecological functions. Most notably, seagrass beds stabilise sediments, provide habitat for many species including commercially important fish and act as a sink for atmospheric carbon.\u00a0"
