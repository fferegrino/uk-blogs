We can use this data to forecast our business needs, understand our performance, identify and resolve issues and set priorities \u2013 so having better, well-managed and easy-to-use data will help us provide the best service possible to those who rely on us."

They mean we will work more efficiently and use our resource to deliver more complex, proactive insights. They will help us create a culture where everyone is able to find and use the data they need.
