            "text": "Land contamination was a major hurdle to overcome. Giant hogweed covered much of the site and the stream contained heavy metals from past industry and hydrocarbons from nearby roads. Multiple underground services crisscrossed the site, power cables, local sewers and infrastructure from the Rampion offshore wind farm made designing and constructing the channel very challenging. Even the topography of the site didn\u2019t lend itself to an easy design process because rivers don\u2019t like running uphill, we had to dig down and down to get the gradient right and ensure the river flowed naturally."

        {
            "text": "We were able to overcome these challenges in August 2020 when contractors Salix River and Wetland Services constructed a new river channel and built two sediment traps. These helped slow, filter and store contamination from urban and road run-off. The sediment traps slow the water entering the site and the sediment containing the contamination drops to the bottom of the trap where it is dug out and disposed of when full. The water quality in the restored stretch is much better as a result which benefits the animals and plants that have made the site home."

The Teville Stream, which meets with the Broadwater Brook, has been largely culverted since the Second World War, expanding the urban area to make space for industrial estates, housing and roads. \u00a0The stream, which was formerly three-quarters culverted, has now been re-routed away from sources of contamination. The restored urban chalk stream now meanders as an open channel across former agricultural land, creating a fantastic new wetland."
