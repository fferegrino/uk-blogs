I had precious experience of working in a school, during my year abroad at university, where I taught English to primary school age children in France."

What resonated most was the opportunity to play a small role in ensuring that every child, regardless of background or location, has access to the best education possible. From personal experience, I know that tailored attention and encouragement can help pupils to achieve and build their confidence."

There is real satisfaction in knowing that you have planned a quality lesson which has achieved its aims and made a real impact on the child. I regularly liaise with teaching staff for guidance and support, to ensure that my content meets curriculum needs. My colleagues have provided invaluable insight into the pupils, this helps me to create tailored and impactful resources to best support their individual needs."

Each child has their own learning challenges both inside and outside of school and have competing demands on their concentration levels and motivation. It is essential that my approach to learning is flexible, allowing me to achieve the best outcome for that child on that particular day."

I particularly remember the first time a child ran up to tell me that the word we learnt together came up in another lesson and helped unlock the subject for them. Witnessing a child\u2019s lightbulb moment is incredibly rewarding and it\u2019s a privilege to help them realise their potential. Pupils who would previously struggle, are now engaged, contributing members when doing group work."
