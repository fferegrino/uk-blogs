One project, for example, is looking at how to safely close shafts and tunnels when a GDF is sealed."

The National Hydrological and Geological Survey (SNHGS) became responsible for construction and management of the URL, who have created a truly world-renowned research laboratory here."

The event involved a series of presentations, discussions and an opportunity to wander along the tunnels where we could see the workstations and chat to the researchers \u2013 there\u2019s a real sense of passion about the progress being made and of support for each of the different programmes world-wide."

Repositories don\u2019t necessarily need to be in lower sedimentary rock like Mont Terri, but it\u2019s one of the geological environments we know could be suitable for the UK."

Several of them started decades ago, providing understanding about how the rock and engineered parts of a GDF evolve over time.\u00a0 We also follow experiments that will help us characterise potential GDF sites since this ensures that, for our sites, we will gather relevant information using the right tools and equipment, so we then have knowledge in place able to interpret the data."

We also participate in experiments in other European underground rock labs, delivering research in support of European and international collaborations such as Sweden\u2019s \u00c4sp\u00f6 Task Force and EURAD projects.\u00a0 We recognise that working together, sharing research and knowledge is essential to ensuring our science provides the confidence necessary for protecting people and the environment."

A decision on the most suitable site could be made during 2022."
