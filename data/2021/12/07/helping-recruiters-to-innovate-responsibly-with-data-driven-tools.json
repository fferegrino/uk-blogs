            "text": "The use of data-driven tools is rising across the recruitment sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for effective and efficient digital tools in hiring as recruiters search for the highest calibre candidates in an increasingly virtual world. Companies are using data-driven tools across the recruitment cycle: from sourcing high-quality applicants through targeted advertising on social media, to sifting candidates through CV screening and evaluation software."

            "text": "These technologies present opportunities to make the recruitment process more effective: data-driven tools can help standardise elements of assessment and enable organisations to reach a wider and more diverse pool of candidates. But they are not without risk. Poorly designed or implemented tools risk perpetuating existing biases or creating new barriers to fair recruitment. Getting decision-making wrong in the recruitment sector negatively impacts on candidates and employers alike: with peoples\u2019 job opportunities and futures on the line, it is imperative that organisations make decisions that are well-informed and fair.\u00a0"

Others, including a recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Future of Work, highlighted that a key barrier to trusting AI tools in the workplace is uncertainty around how to hold developers to account.\u00a0"

We combined the CDEI\u2019s expertise on data-driven technology and associated ethical and policy issues, with the REC\u2019s deep knowledge of the recruitment industry, drawn from their broad industry membership. The resulting guidance, published today, aims to help recruiters be discerning buyers and confident, responsible users of a range of data-driven technologies in recruitment."

Both the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) and the Equality & Human Rights Commission (EHRC) have also indicated that they plan to update their regulatory guidance in this area."

Centrally, the guidance empowers recruiters to ask the right questions of vendors, ultimately driving the supply chain to consider these issues properly. Concrete steps to help evaluate and ensure high standards - both from the vendor and internally - around functionality, accuracy, bias and discrimination, accessibility, data protection and transparency are covered.\u00a0"

This is particularly critical in recruitment, where unfair tools can have a significant impact on individuals, and recruitment teams often lack the appropriate in-house specialist knowledge to assess the performance of new technology (although in some cases, such as psychometric testing, the issues are similar to those with more traditional recruitment tools). Our forthcoming AI assurance ecosystem roadmap will set out the steps required to develop a thriving ecosystem of assurance tools and services that can provide this validation."
