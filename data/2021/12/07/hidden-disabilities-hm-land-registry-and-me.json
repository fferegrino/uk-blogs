            "text": "Later in life I started suffering with immense pains and my joints would dislocate for no reason. My jaw would dislocate when brushing my teeth, my finger(s) would dislocate when pushing a trolley in the supermarket. I would get tendon tears (like sporting injuries) while I was asleep, and they would take weeks to heal. I found that I started to become almost too scared to move."

I trained as a teacher, but I didn\u2019t know how to manage my conditions properly and ended up losing my way. I found it hard to find a way to earn a living that I was physically able to do."

I know how to look after my body to minimise stress on my joints and tissues. My son introduced me to Buddhism, and I have taken a lot from the teachings with Kelsang Pagpa."
