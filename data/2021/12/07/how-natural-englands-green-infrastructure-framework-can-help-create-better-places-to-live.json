It supports the greening of our towns and cities and connections with the surrounding landscape. Natural England is central to delivering the Framework and we\u2019ve now gone live with two of its key elements which will help local planning authorities, developers and communities make better places to live, learn work and play:"

It\u2019s important for health and wellbeing, air quality, nature recovery and for delivering net zero targets, as well as for adapting to climate change by providing urban cooling and reducing flood risk. It can help to address issues of social inequality and environmental decline, whilst also making better places to live."

            "text": "Mapping variations across the country means we can support better planning for good quality GI and help to target the creation or improvement of GI where existing provision is poorest and where there are opportunities for these important assets to be better managed for the environment and to deliver a wider range of multifunctional benefits."

            "text": "The elements of the GI Framework now published \u2013 the GI Principles and GI Mapping - will help local planning authorities and developers meet requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework to consider GI in local plans and in new development. The Framework is also being developed to enable other organisations and groups such as parks and green space managers and local communities to think more about GI and plan for its creation or improvement."

            "text": "For example, the GI Mapping Database brings together data from over 40 individual environmental and socio-economic datasets. Local authorities and others may use the database to inform the development of local plans, policies and GI strategies, and can download the spatial files to add their own data to it. It can be used in engagement with stakeholders, including developers and communities, to help identify priorities for GI enhancement and creation."

Additional elements will include the core GI Standards, from which local authorities can set their own local standards, for example on accessible natural green space or urban greening. It will also include a GI Design Guide, case studies and \u2018process journeys\u2019- intended to assist different audiences in applying the GI Framework."

This will help us to improve the GI Framework, with the ultimate aim of helping to plan and deliver good quality networks of multifunctional green infrastructure for the benefit of all."

These are initial findings, and the data comes with caveats and limitations as set out in the GI Mapping User Guide. Further work will be undertaken in the next phase to analyse the data in more detail."
