The government, and several companies, are pursuing fusion designs which may be built before 2040, bringing large scale deployment of this technology within grasp to support low carbon electricity generation beyond 2050."

            "text": "Fusion generates power in a fundamentally different way from traditional nuclear power stations which use the fission process. Fusion is the process of forcing small nuclei to combine whereas fission is the splitting of large unstable nuclei. Both processes result in the release of energy which can be transformed to electricity using standard turbine systems."

        {
            "text": "Fusion makes use of radioactive material and will generate radioactive wastes but it does not produce the extremely long lived radiotoxic wastes which arise from nuclear fission. As a result, the long-term environmental impact and potential accident consequences are significantly reduced for a fusion power station."

UKAEA run several facilities including the \u2018Hydrogen-3 Advanced technology (H3AT)\u2019, the world\u2019s first tritium research centre. Tritium is one of the two main fuels needed for commercial fusion."
