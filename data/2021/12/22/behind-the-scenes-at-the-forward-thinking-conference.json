I\u2019d passed the campus thousands of times, but never been inside, even though the secret garden of academia is just a few minutes\u2019 walk from our Birmingham office. The facilities were spacious, modern, and allowed us to stream the event online simultaneously. We only saw the proverbial tip of the iceberg during our little time there, but it was clear why Aston was The Guardian\u2019s University of the Year for 2020."

Each speaker was an expert in their respected fields, with a broad range of knowledge in the UK insolvency regime, as well as further afield including Canada, Cyprus, and Nigeria."

The papers presented were a mixture of technical or research, with some sessions hosting a panel of experts combining similar themes such as pre-pack administrations. All the talks were lively and engaging, with good use of slides and positive participation from audience."

Thankfully, the team who broadcast the event online have recorded the livestreams, and we\u2019re planning on publishing those in due course. We\u2019ll also looking to publish online the papers when the presenters have finalised their work. We expect to publish those in Spring 2022."
