            "text": "In the past there may have been scepticism around the idea that men needed a network. That view comes from an old way of thinking that men just get on with things and do not talk about issues that may be troubling them. We wanted to create a space where anyone could come along and ask questions, share any issues they may have and seek support when needed."

He asked if I would be interested in helping get things up and running.\u00a0I jumped at the opportunity, and our journey started there."

It turned out my suggestion of \u201cThe Shed\u201d was chosen. It was picked because of its slightly stereotypical view of a shed being a sanctuary for men, but also a place where anyone could go in look around the shed and take away anything they may find useful."

We certainly didn't want to exclude anybody who wanted to join up, so the network really is for anybody who wants to make use of it."

We have worked closely with our Break the Stigma Network in creating a buddy scheme to help people move back into the office environment once restrictions had eased around the country."

Since then, we attend a monthly call with the Man Down Network not only to share ideas, but which is just a place where anybody on the call can talk about anything they like. Our Co-Chair has attended one of these and was genuinely moved by the conversation he heard on the call."
