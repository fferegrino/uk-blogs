            "text": "The UK has been leading the way in supporting and promoting transparency of clinical trials. Following our exit from the EU, the MHRA has been monitoring compliance with registration of trials of medicines in World Health Organisation recognised public databases, and reporting of trial summary results, and has been pro-active in contacting sponsors to ensure transparency expectations are met.\u00a0 This complements the annual clinical trial registration audits carried out by the Health Research Authority (HRA). Moving forward, UK trials will be registered on behalf of sponsors on ISRCTN by the HRA, and a new, standardised end-of-study report to Research Ethics Committees will help facilitate and monitor compliance. In addition, an upcoming public consultation on potential changes to the UK legal framework for trials of medicines may help us embed transparency in legislation and introduce the ability to issue sanctions where this has not been complied with."

            "text": "While details of study protocols appear in the EU Register via uploading of information to EudraCT by the regulator, it is the trial sponsors responsibility to ensure that the protocol information and results of all clinical trials are posted in EudraCT for publication. European guidance states that this posting is considered as the submission of the clinical trial summary report as part of the end-of-trial-declaration to national competent authorities, which makes national monitoring of compliance difficult.\u00a0 An audit by the European Medicines Agency in April 2019 showed that results were lacking for over 30% of studies in the database, varying widely between commercial and non-commercial sponsors. \u00a0Other international studies have suggested even lower levels of compliance."

Unsurprisingly, when we followed-up with sponsors the pandemic was quoted as the main reason for non-compliance. Staff shortages and changes to working arrangements had an impact, as did unavailability of laboratory resource for analysis of data. Others quoted technical issues with the EudraCT system that needed to be resolved before their results become public."

Be Part of Research is an online service that provides an opportunity to help members of the public understand what research is and what it might mean to take part, as well as showing what research is currently happening across the UK. Study data on this site is refreshed weekly and comes directly from two databases, the ISRCTN Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov (studies registered only in the EU clinical trial registry have never been visible in Be Part of Research). \u00a0\u00a0As all UK clinical trials of investigational medicinal products will now be registered in the ISRCTN registry, these will all be visible on Be Part of Research."
