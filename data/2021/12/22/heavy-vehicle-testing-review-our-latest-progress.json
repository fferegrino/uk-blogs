So for my latest update, I want to explain how this is driving forward our actions on the Heavy Vehicle Testing Review."

            "text": "For me, that solution is really important because getting things joined up between DVSA and ATFs for the end customer \u2013 vehicle operators, leasing companies and other vehicle users \u2013 is key to making the service work better."

        {
            "text": "We know from the Heavy Vehicle Testing Review that the current way of scheduling testing hours to ATFs does not always let operators book as far ahead as they might want to. But we also know that flexibility to change things at shorter notice can be important."

        {
            "text": "So we\u2019ve been carrying out some deeper research into this, through focus groups with ATFs and vehicle operators. The sessions have looked at: how tests are booked, how the process works for customers and how it fits in with their maintenance regimes."

        {
            "text": "Two key themes have come out so far. One is around certainty, which is something that\u2019s critical for many operators. This is understandable, because vehicles and trailers need to be part of a planned and preventative maintenance system. So having certainty about when and where tests are scheduled is important."
        },
        {
            "text": "The other theme is about flexibility. This can be particularly important for smaller operators, for example if the ownership of a vehicle changes at short notice, or where a vehicle ends up in a different location."
        },
        {
            "text": "So how does this help us to review our process for scheduling testing hours to ATFs? Normally, we book testing hours in quarterly periods. But this is not always helpful for the certainty and flexibility which vehicle operators and ATFs want."

            "text": "One of the things I'm keen to look at is whether we can move to a longer term view of planning and confirming testing resource. This could mean we agree testing hours with ATFs over a rolling 13 month period, for example."
        },
        {
            "text": "There would need to be a process to enable short-term adjustments, whether that\u2019s for the ATF to add some extra days, or maybe to cancel some. Hopefully this type of approach would enable ATFs to give vehicle users the service that they need \u2013 offering certainty, but also enabling flexibility."

            "text": "As I said, we\u2019re continuing to carry out research with ATFs and vehicle operators. And we\u2019d welcome your feedback on this blog post. The key thing is that the new approach ensures we best meet customer needs."

The reality is that any changes cannot happen overnight, particularly as we\u2019ve already confirmed some of the quarterly booking process for 2022."
