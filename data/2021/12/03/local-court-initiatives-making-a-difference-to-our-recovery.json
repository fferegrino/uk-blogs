Whether it\u2019s large scale national projects running at pace to deliver more capacity for court hearings, or creative solutions to challenges faced by individual courts \u2013 the ingenuity and commitment of HMCTS staff and those they work with has been incredible to see."

This combines opening up some additional court rooms, as well as repurposing under-listed courts into trial courts. \u00a0These involve listing 4 to 5 short and routine trials per day sitting with two judges and one bench over a period of one or two weeks. For example, we have moved traffic trials for Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire cases into dedicated trial courts in Leicestershire, releasing approximately 200 hours of court time for higher priority trials in those locations. The dedicated traffic trial courts are clearing 24 traffic trials per court."

We\u2019ve opened two 'super courtrooms' in Manchester and Loughborough. Elsewhere work across England and Wales has continued to accommodate trials with a number of defendants, their legal representatives, witnesses, security and others, often using two or three courtrooms. These have included large murder trials in Crown Court buildings at Leeds (6 defendants), Preston and Reading (both 8 defendants)."

            "text": "Meanwhile Lincoln Crown Court, in the grounds of Lincoln Castle, is a small and unique site where courtrooms have limited flexibility and space is restricted. Recently, the court staff have worked with the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services (PECS) to re-evaluate dock space and introduce new ways of working that allow for more defendants in the dock. This means the court can hear cases with two or three defendants and start to make inroads into outstanding multi-handed cases."

But we\u2019re still dealing with other cases that impact people\u2019s lives. Fraud is an example. Between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 2021, a total of 3,569 cases have been dealt with across England and Wales where a fraud charge was the primary offence. Of these cases, 110 were dealt with by Southwark Crown Court and its Nightingale court annex, Prospero House. These courts support some of the longest and most complex fraud cases, despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic."

In these, remote hearing technology has come into its own, with witnesses giving evidence from abroad via video link. This means trials, like one recently where five people were convicted of \u2018modern slavery\u2019 offences\u2019, can continue despite any travel restrictions that might be in place."
