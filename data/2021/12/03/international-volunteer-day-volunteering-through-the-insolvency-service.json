The boxes are then picked up by our drivers who deliver the parcels to the centres and then collect the food donations from various churches and shops. We also have numerous office volunteers who deal with fund raising, admin, PR & everything and anything that people throw at them!"

We saw a huge number of people who found themselves furloughed or back from university, offering to volunteer with us. In fact, at one point we had to say \u2018thank you but no thank you\u2019 as we didn\u2019t have any volunteer slots left."

Then the supermarkets stepped up and donated essential food supplies and delivered them direct to us. Thankfully, this allowed us to continue to operate, and our first shop donation weighed in at just under a tonne."

            "text": "Once again, the public stepped up and in December 2020 we had the equivalent of three months of donations donated to us in one month. This was amazing, despite the stress it put on the warehouse volunteers and our shelves."

I began chatting to the staff and we got onto talking about the foodbank. Out of that conversation, the coffee shop now donates jams and spreads to the foodbank every 6 months. Yes, our clients need staple foods but a little treat like jam, honey or peanut butter makes a big difference."

We addressed the clients at the door, which was protected by a screen, signposted them as well as we could and then delivered their food to another door."

For me, it\u2019s been such a bonus the Insolvency Service is happy for me to volunteer my time once a month. It\u2019s certainly something I recommend anybody enquiring about."
