The weather had been unpleasant (southerly 7-9) but the skipper and crew had kindly agreed to bag up and store samples representative of the unwanted catch from eight hauls for us to process ashore. This was the 72nd trip co-sampled this year, when Cefas observers, who would normally go out to sea, have been working onshore to sample fish and commercial shellfish for age, sex and maturity data."

            "text": "We are rapidly closing in on our 20th anniversary for a continuous offshore monitoring programme, and until March last year it was dependent on observers sampling commercial catches at sea for biological data on fishing vessels. Collecting these data has always been reliant on the goodwill of fisherman and vessel owners who agreed to take an observer onboard one of their commercial fishing trips to collect biological data from both the retained and discarded components of their catch. As a consequence of the COVID pandemic, both the industry activity and our sampling were seriously affected. Thankfully the industry were able to begin fishing again as their markets reopened, but it was not immediately possible to find an effective way of managing the COVID risk and returning to sampling at sea. Although some at sea sampling is now possible with sufficient mitigations in place, it is still limited to short trips and vessels with sufficient space for our observers to work safely with the crew. As observers started to return to sea, it was obvious that the data from these trips was not going to cover the range and extent of all the English fisheries we usually monitor."

The programme was seen as a potential alternative to the at-sea programme. It was essential to identify such an alternative because the growing gap in data from the at-sea programme risked impacting ICES stock assessments and fisheries management advice. Co-sampling relies more heavily on the involvement of the industry who have to select and bring samples ashore for our observers to sample. Skippers are briefed by our observers and protocols are agreed for selecting the hauls we need the samples from, how to calculate the sample ratios and the additional haul and catch information we require."

The national dispensations required regular communication with Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) and the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) to update vessel lists and extend the sampling to different fisheries. Without their authority this programme would have not started and without their help, cooperation and patience this programme would have been far less successful."

The programme has demanded more of skippers and crew whether at sea or tied up alongside; it\u2019s demanded more from the port staff who help out and allow us access to their facilities and waste disposal when they can. Most of the observers work from remote offices (closed during the pandemic) or home without lab facilities. They have had to be flexible and resourceful, adapting quickly to changes in landing times, access to storage and venues. Where feasible the industry has allowed access to market and quayside facilities to process samples, where other facilities aren\u2019t available."

The programme has demonstrated that representative data for the fisheries sampled can be collected successfully by the fisherman. It is dependent on trust and an understanding between the observer and fisherman of what is needed and a strict adherence to agreed protocols to minimise any potential bias in how and what data are collected. It is reliant on the fisherman\u2019s experience and ability to judge the size of the catch and to determine the total quantities discarded. \u00a0However, because of the legal restrictions on the activities of a commercial fishing vessel and logistical issues relating to bringing some fish ashore, there will still be some gaps in the biological data for some species and fisheries. To resolve these may need a change in approach including more involvement of skippers and crew. This would need further consultation and testing."
