The day is about promoting the rights and well-being of people with disabilities at every level of society, and raising awareness of challenges, barriers and opportunities for those who live with disabilities. This has been more important than ever throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflected in this year\u2019s theme: \u201cFighting for rights in the post-COVID era.\u201d"

            "text": "This scheme doesn\u2019t just involve people with physical disabilities.

One of the biggest lessons I\u2019ve learnt from mutual mentoring is that it\u2019s okay to ask."

        {
            "text": "Inspired by our conversations, I now have an \u2018inclusion moment\u2019 at the beginning of meetings, which gives everyone an opportunity to talk about a time they\u2019ve felt excluded, or indeed where they have made a particular effort to include someone. It\u2019s proven to be a great way to raise awareness while bringing us closer together."

            "text": "My mentor has also seen the benefits. She co-chairs the organisation\u2019s disability network in addition to her day job and was struggling to juggle both. I raised the issue at our executive committee with a view to changing our policy to give people the opportunity and time to do both."

            "text": "Our recently opened new Head Office has been designed with a strong focus on supporting those with disabilities. It is fully accessible and provides a range of workplace adjustments, from ergonomic chairs to specialist IT equipment. In addition, as we move into the post-COVID-19 era, DIO will continue to support hybrid working. This will ensure that our people have the flexibility to manage their health and wellbeing, working in ways which reflect and support their personal needs."

        {
            "text": "Just having something as simple as a safe space between two colleagues has really opened my mind to the barriers that can affect people with disabilities. This International Day of People with Disabilities, I encourage us all to have open conversations about how we can continue to support diversity and inclusion, both in our working and personal lives."
