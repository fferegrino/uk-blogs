John has always been very keen to invest in the wellbeing of staff and is always seeking new ways to drive improvement. The workshops started in February 2020, just before lockdown began, and have continued throughout 2020 and 2021. To begin with they were online and now they are being delivered in person. Under John\u2019s leadership, I am currently supporting the seventh cohort of social workers to change and improve their lives, through a mixture of workshops, one to one coaching and running.\u00a0"
