            "text": "As we look to the future, and as the UK emerges from the worst of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, promoting competition will be more important than ever before. Competitive markets are essential to creating the conditions for investment and sustainable long-term growth in the UK. They drive innovation, increasing our productivity, meaning we can produce more with less. When markets aren\u2019t competitive, prices go up, quality drops and the cost of living rises, hitting the less well-off households the hardest."

            "text": "The CMA has an important role to play in building trust and confidence when people buy goods and services, and in fostering competition. We will continue to focus on high impact enforcement of competition and consumer law. We will remain alert to the risk of anti-competitive collusion, to mergers seeking to reduce competition and capitalise on the financial distress of businesses, and to attempts to exploit consumers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and microbusinesses."

We have launched the shadow Digital Markets Unit (DMU), set up and launched the Office for the Internal Market (OIM), and recommenced our work on the UK\u2019s future subsidy control regime by preparing for the creation of the Subsidy Advice Unit (SAU), each of which brings a new set of powers, functions and responsibilities. We have also published the first Annual State of Competition report. At the same time, the volume of complex, multinational merger and antitrust cases, often with a digital focus, continues to grow."

In 2020 to 21 we secured commitments to refund hundreds of millions of pounds to consumers for package holidays that were cancelled due to the restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. We also advised the government on ways to make the PCR testing market work better and opened investigations into two PCR testing firms who may be breaking the law."

Both decisions are currently under appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT)."

We recently accepted undertakings for the completed acquisition by Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited of Asda Group Limited after competition concerns were raised. We were concerned that the purchase could lead to higher petrol prices in some parts of the UK. In November, we instructed JD Sports to sell Footasylum after an in-depth investigation identified competition concerns. We have also issued our provisional report, finding competition concerns, in the in-depth phase 2 investigation into Facebook\u2019s takeover of Giphy."

We are now inviting comments on ways to tackle these issues, including recommendations to the UK and devolved governments. Our final report is due to be published in March 2022."

As part of the electric vehicle charging market study, we provided clear recommendations to governments designed to ensure that this new and fast-growing sector works well for UK drivers. Following on from the market study, we are also investigating long-term exclusive arrangements between a ChargePoint provider and three motorway service operators. The electric vehicle charging sector is crucial to the roll-out of electric vehicles, so we want to ensure that it works well for consumers as part of our commitment on climate change."
