The warning signs came when my parents took loads of baby photos of me, as is tradition, and in all these photos, only my left eye would appear red.\u00a0It\u00a0could be put down to weird lighting, but the trend continued until they knew something wasn\u2019t right. Several specialist check-ups later, I was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0"

I deliberately chose very positive language\u00a0to tell this story, but equally I could have written that I have lost the vision in my left eye and a lot of the vision in my right eye has been compromised. But\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0a \u2018glass half full\u2019 way of looking at things.\u00a0"

I can fine tune things like contrast and my curser, making little tweaks like that can make a big difference. I use the built-in screen reader, which feeds back where I am clicking and reads text aloud. Everyone, to some extent, reads what they think they have written, rather than what it actually says. I find with my visual impairment, I do this a lot more because my brain fills in the visual blanks. So, the screen reader is incredibly useful when I\u2019m sense checking my work.\u00a0\u00a0"

That\u2019s the power of the community for me. I was amazed at how many people were going through similar stuff, I was na\u00efve to think I may have been the only one. In a community this large, nobody should ever feel alone. I am a huge advocate for talking about these things and sharing stories. Every story I hear from someone else gives me something new to think about, so please do reach out to me if you want a chat andrew.wilday@dwp.gov.uk\u00a0"
