REACT 1 is the strand of the study that asks people to take a swab test to establish how many people test positive for SARS-CoV-2, including those who don\u2019t have symptoms, and the respective rate of infection in different demographic groups."

REACT still needs your help and support \u2013 in particular, it needs more participants from ethnic minority groups and young people aged between 18 and 35, as the virus is at higher levels in these groups."
