In Europe, invasive species such as grey squirrels, raccoons, pot-bellied pigs, parakeets and Canada geese now roam our cities. Their environmental and economic impact is phenomenal, ranging from disease transmission to damage to crops and forestry, traffic accidents, attacks on people and pets, nuisance behaviour and impacts on native species."

The same happened to a nudist in Berlin, whose video went viral as he ran in his birthday suit after a sow that had grabbed his backpack! Local authorities suggested killing the sow and thousands signed a petition against it."

Meanwhile, African Swine Fever virus is travelling through Eurasian pigs and wild boar, costing billions to the pig industry. In the United Kingdom (UK), many sea towns are warning not to feed gulls that regularly swoop over tourists, stealing fish and chips and even ice creams."

            "text": "Culling is unpopular for ethical, environmental and animal welfare reasons (think rodenticides) and may not be feasible as the sole option to keep numbers down. Moving animals out of their native area (translocation) causes stress and many die trying to go back home or simply resume the nuisance behaviour in the new area. Translocations also spread pathogens to local resident populations that also do not take kindly to newcomers dumped on their patch. Using contraceptives for slowing down reproductive rates may offer an extra tool to manage human-wildlife conflicts."

Since the initial project on an injectable contraceptive vaccine for wild boar, we have tested contraceptives for wild boar in Spain and Hong Kong, for goats in Wales, for badgers, parakeets and grey squirrels in England, for feral cattle in Hong Kong and for stray dogs in Nepal and India."

We had fun with naming the POD (parakeet-operated-device) and the BOS (boar-operated-system). We are particularly proud of the BOS, which exploits the natural rooting behaviour of wild boar. The BOS consists of a metal bell, sliding on a pole and covering a round base where one can place bait containing contraceptives or vaccines. We proved that wild boar in the UK, in the US and in Italy is the only species (apart from bears!) capable of lifting the bell and feeding on the bait."
