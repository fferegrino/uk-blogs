            "text": "I had to let go of doing all parts of user-centred design, but I believe that it\u2019s right. Given the importance of government services, all roles have best practices to follow and changes to keep up with. For example, when I was a user researcher, I had to follow rigorous recruitment practices and diligently share results. As an interaction designer, I know the nuances of using GOV.UK Design System patterns and the prototype kit.\u00a0"

I never got to do this in the private sector, and now it\u2019s my favourite part of the job. I love collaborating with a content designer and shaping a user-centred journey together. It\u2019s also great to work with technical colleagues to understand the art of the possible and iterate designs based on user insights from user researchers and performance analysts."

Especially since they are meant to be accessible to anyone and everyone who needs to access a government service. Accessibility doesn\u2019t solely apply to services. There are also colleagues who advocate for accessibility by offering training and consultation sessions and being vocal when a product or service is not completely accessible."

These have been a great way to push my skills in directions that my day-to-day work might not offer."

There are thousands of designers in government now \u2013 and different groups get together to push forward various aspects of our craft. Whether that\u2019s working together on new user interface (UI) components or sharing advice on how to grow more equitable design teams, we learn from each other\u2019s work and work in the open so we can build on each other\u2019s knowledge."

This could manifest as a lack of budget or incentives to test with users. It could be not investing in research and design roles, or even favouring insights pulled from testing which represent low-cost fixes to a service rather than large, fundamental changes."
