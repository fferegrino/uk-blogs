            "text": "Yes, you read that correctly. The airport has a road in the middle of its runway. At four lanes wide, Winston Churchill Avenue is the main road leading in and out of Gibraltar and it has to be closed every time a plane takes off or lands. The airport is managed by the RAF, who co-ordinate all of Gibraltar\u2019s air traffic, including civilian flights."

This is extremely important, as even a small piece of FOD could cause serious damage to an aircraft, putting the passengers and crew at risk. But having a road running through it isn\u2019t the only special thing about the Gibraltar runway, as it also extends out into the sea with a third of its total length being built into the water."

At 426 metres high, the rock is almost 50 metres taller than the roof height of the New York City skyscraper. This height means that the rock offers a major strategical advantage, and the radar equipment positioned on top of its summit helps to track flight paths from the airfield below."

Legend says that as long as the monkeys exist in Gibraltar the territory will remain under British rule. During World War II the population dwindled to just seven monkeys, so Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered that their numbers be replenished from both Algeria and Morocco."

Well, that\u2019s because it is a lot!\u00a0 It\u2019s almost twice the length of its entire road network. During World War II the tunnels become an underground fortress that could hold 16,000 personnel and their equipment and supplies. Whilst parts of the tunnels are now open to the public, other parts have been repurposed into a training ground for the Armed Forces. Earlier this year the Royal Gibraltar Regiment completed a four-day exercise in the tunnels aimed at simulating underground offensive actions."

After three years the siege came to an end when a British convoy of 31 transport ships managed to break the blockade, bringing in vital supplies, food, ammunition, and troops. With these reinforcements negotiations were reopened and a peace treaty was finally signed."
