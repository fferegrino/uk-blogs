These tree species include broadleaf species, such as silver birch, willow, alder and rowan, which grow easily in otherwise challenging conditions, such as poor soil fertility and mountainous terrain."

            "text": "Given England\u2019s tree planting commitments and need to increase sustainable timber production, these broadleaf species must be considered in tree planting projects. However, these species are difficult to integrate into mechanised sowing operations due to their small sized and/or irregularly shaped seed. Furthermore, much like other tree species, there is a limited amount of broadleaf seed supply, which therefore must be used efficiently."

            "text": "Seed pelleting can be used to resolve this issue. However, the pelleting process commonly used in the horticultural industry may cause moisture deprivation in broadleaf seeds. Given that these species are acutely sensitive to moisture deprivation, using standard pelleting techniques and materials may cause germination failures."

These fungi, known as mycorrhizal fungi, quickly die whenever their host trees are missing, such as in upland, clear-felled or ex-agricultural sites that have little connectivity to other nearby woodlands. When we try to replant these areas, trees have a harder time establishing, leading to slower growth rates, higher mortality, and lost potential for carbon sequestration."

These fungi will then be grown at scale using fermentation technology before being encapsulated in pellets that can be applied to the planting hole prior to a tree being planted."

Without this project there would be no supply of local mycorrhizal fungi to be used in tree planting operations resulting in slow growing forests with high susceptibility to droughts and disease."

The IGS systems are fully modular and allow greater flexibility than other comparable systems to enable the specific optimisation of certain species and seasonal flexibility."

The objective of our project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using TCEA to produce year-round forestry seedlings while improving the quality of seedling production and reducing wastage/cost compared to traditional methods. We will also be testing some TreeTape trays for forestry seedlings."
