            "text": "It doesn\u2019t take into account the intersectionality of a person or look at their life from a person-centred perspective, considering all their experience, history, culture, beliefs and needs. This means an individual\u2019s ability to access support and opportunities to have a meaningful life can often be compromised"

There is no quick fix here, but progress can start today if we are facing the right direction when we take those initial steps."
