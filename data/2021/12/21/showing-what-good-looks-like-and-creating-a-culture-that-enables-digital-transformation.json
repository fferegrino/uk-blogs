As the service moved into beta, the team and colleagues in the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) focused on changing the culture and bringing the rest of UK Export Finance (UKEF) on its transformation journey."

These workshops involved a group of interested people to bounce ideas and problems around, steering and advising the team at both a tactical and strategic level.\u00a0"

Doing this was a real revelation for people and helped stakeholders see the value in the approach.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
