Did you know, that for every 1 million turkeys cooked, around 250 tonnes of fats and oils could find their way into drains? That\u2019s about nine times as heavy as the Statue of Liberty! Imagine the size of the fatberg that could create in our region\u2019s sewerage system."

As a person who spends a lot of time outdoors and around our beautiful water environment, that\u2019s very unpleasant to see and it also causes pollution that kills fish and other wildlife."

When these mix with fats, oils and grease they form fatbergs."
