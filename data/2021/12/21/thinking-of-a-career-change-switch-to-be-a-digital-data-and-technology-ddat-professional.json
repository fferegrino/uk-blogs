To inspire you, we spoke to colleagues in the DDaT team about their career journey into their current roles, what inspired them to join a digital, data, and tech team, and their advice for someone wanting to make a similar move."

At this time, I was applying to heritage roles in the UK with tough competition. My favourite job interview was in a castle, to be the Collections Manager of the spoon collection."

From here I joined the DDaT Fast Stream, taking on a variety of roles across various government departments plus a secondment at a small charity. I applied for a permanent role at DIT during my third year on the Fast Stream programme and have been here ever since."

I found that I enjoyed figuring out how to make the code work and decided that I wanted to work in digital. When I realised that the Civil Service had a DDaT Fast Stream pathway, this seemed like a great opportunity to switch to a different specialism while fulfilling my long-term ambition to join the Civil Service. I really appreciate that the Civil Service took me on based on potential, rather than expecting me to already have digital experience."
