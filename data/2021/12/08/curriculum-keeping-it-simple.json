We\u2019ll say more on this in a minute. A subject deep dive will explore whether pupils have been taught and have learned the curriculum content they need to achieve the goals that schools have for their education."

            "text": "This inspection focus on curriculum is based on the insight from research into human cognition: if pupils don\u2019t succeed in learning what we hoped then they have knowledge gaps that will be preventing that success. When pupils are successful, the knowledge they need has built over time, allowing them to understand more complex ideas and undertake more complex tasks. A Jenga tower analogy is useful here. When pupils understand more complex ideas, the Jenga tower is sturdy. When bits of knowledge are missing, the tower can become wobbly."

            "text": "When pupils are not successful, this is sometimes because the knowledge they need was not identified and taught to them. It might be obvious if there are gaps in the teaching of mathematics but often pupils can be asked complex questions in English or foundation subjects without the depth of knowledge that would allow them to provide a meaningful answer."

            "text": "Sometimes, the knowledge that pupils need has been taught but perhaps not given the necessary emphasis or not repeated often enough to ensure that they learn it for future use. Pupils can become confused if crucial knowledge is not taught in a coherent sequence or broken down into small enough bite-sized chunks. Perhaps the teaching activities chosen to deliver the curriculum are not effective."

For Ofsted, intent is simply what you want pupils to learn: your curriculum thinking and high-level planning. Implementation is the teaching activities you choose to teach your curriculum. Impact is when that curriculum content is learned. There are no extra forms of documentation needed for inspection because all schools already plan curriculum content and teaching activities designed to ensure that curriculum content is learned."

            "text": "As we\u2019ve explored, deep dives help us consider the effectiveness of the quality of education in a specific timeframe when we inspect. They aren\u2019t really designed for anything else. If schools want to drill down to the quality of curriculum themselves, there are probably better ways of doing this than doing internal deep dives. That\u2019s because you see your curriculum being taught every day. This gives you scope to consider curriculum effectiveness in more detail and as an ongoing conversation."
