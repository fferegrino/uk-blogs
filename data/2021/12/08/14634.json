The UKHSA has worked closely with a range of partners who have tested, authorised, procured, monitored, researched, and delivered vaccines. We know the vaccines save lives, and alongside the NHS, DHSC, BEIS, MHRA and many others, our different roles will continue to support the effort to break the link between infection and severe outcomes."

In light of the emergence of the Omicron variant, our skilled and experienced research scientists are now working in our laboratories with live virus to build an understanding of whether Omicron can evade our current vaccines and those in development.\u00a0 A key part of this work is rapid PCR testing and sequencing of suspected Omicron-positive clinical samples and isolation of virus to support evaluation of performance of in-use Lateral Flow Devises against the Omicron VoC and other genotyping and sequencing analysis across UKHSA and NHS laboratories."

Teams assessed the UK\u2019s infrastructure to ensure that vaccines could be safely stored and delivered and huge freezers and warehouses were prepared to accommodate different vaccines. The vaccines themselves are just one component in the process of getting a jab. The UKHSA also managed the ordering and distribution of the needles, diluent needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, produced patient information leaflets, and patient record cards."

As soon as health professionals began administering on 8 December, UKHSA experts (then PHE) began gathering vital real-world data. This data has underpinned vaccination advice for\u00a0health professionals, provided vital reassurance to the public, and demonstrated real world insights into vaccine safety, efficacy and side effects."

It confirmed the vaccine was providing high levels of protection against symptomatic COVID-19 disease, instilling vital reassurance in the programme. The results showed one dose of the vaccine was 57 per cent effective for those aged over 80, and a second dose potentially more than 85 per cent effective."

Initial results of the study showed one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of catching COVID-19 infection by more than 70 per cent for those aged under 65, rising to 85 per cent after a second dose. This was among the first evidence suggesting the vaccine may be helping to interrupt transmission of the virus, as well as protecting against disease."

We have also published data on waning immunity \u2013 critical analysis that informed the rollout of the booster programme."
