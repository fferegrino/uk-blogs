            "text": "All viruses naturally change and evolve over time, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, is no exception. Sometimes, changes and mutations result in new variants that may be sufficiently different biologically to impact the severity of infection, susceptibility to infection, or transmissibility of the virus. The changes can potentially also affect the efficacy of our diagnostic tests or vaccines."

This is why we have increased our genomic sequencing capacity, to strengthen our surveillance and help us identify new variants of potential public health concern more quickly and effectively."

When we identify a case, the contacts are traced, tested and asked to self-isolate. We have conducted targeted testing in specific locations where known Omicron cases have visited to identify and control any possible spread. We have also advised on public health measures, such as wearing masks, to reduce the risk of transmission."

            "text": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is an important component of our surveillance to identify cases of different variants, following a positive PCR test result. This process can take a few days, so we use a marker known as \u2018S gene target failure\u2019 to identify possible Omicron cases rapidly and inform public health action. The Omicron variant of the virus has a number of mutations which mean that the S gene does not show up in PCR results. This referred to as S gene dropout or S gene target failure and it can be used as marker for this variant pending the WGS results."

They do this by incubating the materials containing the virus with cells and growing the virus in the laboratory. The virus is incubated to allow it to multiply. This can take up to seven days or sometimes longer and it results in a small volume of \u201cvirus stock\u201d. Once they have produced the virus stock, our scientists can undertake the critical risk assessment studies to understand the risks from the new variant."
