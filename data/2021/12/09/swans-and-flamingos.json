A \u2018black swan\u2019 is an unexpected and extreme event that can only be rationalised retrospectively. For the \u2018green swan\u2019 of climate change, however, while we are uncertain of its ultimate consequences, we are acutely aware that they will be severe."

Speakers noted that a progressive approach by central banks is important for scaling up green finance. However, before the green flamingo can fly, there was agreement that more work is to be done, including to build the foundations of financial sector resilience and responsiveness to climate risk."

The challenge was to identify actions consistent with the central bank\u2019s mandate and considerate of political economy ramifications. So, I found it insightful to hear at the conference how central banks are putting steps in motion to develop frameworks and guidance for credible risk assessments."

These measures include climate-related scenario analysis, stress testing, and mandatory disclosures to address critical data gaps. These developments should help to manage climate risks and lay the groundwork for a green flamingo."
