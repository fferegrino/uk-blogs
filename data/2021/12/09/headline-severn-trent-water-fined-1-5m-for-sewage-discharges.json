It also heard how at another site, sewage sludge was not managed properly over the winter, causing it to build up and discharge into Sugar Brook and Hen Brook, while equipment failure at the Priest Bridge works led to discharges over a two-day period in August 2018."

Any company caught breaching their permits could face a range of possible enforcement action \u2013 up to and including fines and prosecution. Fines can be up to 10% of annual turnover for civil cases, or unlimited in criminal proceedings."
