Unfortunately, already this winter season we have diagnosed more cases than in any previous UK outbreak; 55 cases of high pathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza (bird flu) cases have now been confirmed on sites across Great Britain (GB) at the time of blog publication.\u00a0 A GB wide avian influenza (AI) prevention zone to reduce risk of spread from wild birds to poultry was imposed on 3 November followed by the requirement to house all poultry on 29 November."

All these activities support decisions to enable fast and effective control. Surveillance has also started to start the process for GB becoming disease free again. In this blog, learn how APHA has responded to this emergency and actions you can take to help."

We would usually expect to see the first cases in late autumn with the peak risk occurring between December and February. This year, the first case was confirmed by APHA even earlier at the end of October. Subsequently, to date, we have confirmed infection in over 320 wild birds from across GB. It appears that the timing and scale of this event in wild birds is earlier and on a greater scale than previous years. This higher risk for infection of poultry as a result has translated into the large number of cases."

From a food safety perspective, this risk remains very low to UK consumers. The risk to public health is very low."

This is especially important as we are in a period of heightened risk that will last for several months. Please see the most up-to-date biosecurity advice on GOV.UK and consider joining one of the Defra webinars being organised."
