            "text": "On Christmas Eve, when Santa Claus calls the Met Office for a route forecast, he\u2019s put straight through to the World Area Forecast Centre (WAFC). There are only two World Area Forecast Centres in the world, both established in the early 1980s to meet pilots\u2019 needs for meteorological information. One is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA and the other is operated by the Met Office in the UK. Every six hours, a Significant Weather Chart is produced \u2013 an essential tool for pilots and for Santa \u2013 to provide a broad overview of aviation hazards around the world. \u201cWe\u2019ll plot an efficient route for Santa that uses the jet stream as a tail wind and avoids erupting volcanoes, thunderstorms and clear air turbulence,\u201d says Matt Box in the WAFC team. \u201cHe\u2019s particularly concerned about presents falling from the back of the sleigh. And he\u2019ll always ask questions about fog so he can decide whether to use Rudolph\u2019s glowing red nose.\u201d"

            "text": "For more detail on what to expect on his global tour, Santa will speak to an expert meteorologist at the Met Office Global Guidance Unit (GGU). Every day, a Global Weather Impacts Assessment is produced, which plots details of severe weather and its impacts around the world. As well as day-to-day weather impacts, there are ongoing seasonal variations in the weather. A significant factor this year is La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific with ramifications on weather patterns throughout the world. \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a leads to wetter weather in Australia and Indonesia and drier weather in East Africa. It can also lead to colder spells during the first half of winter in northwest Europe,\u201d according to GGU Meteorologist Adam Thornhill. \u201cSanta is very familiar with the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, since La Ni\u00f1a and its opposite phase El Ni\u00f1o often peak around Christmas.\u201d In fact, the name El Ni\u00f1o, which means The Little Boy or Christ Child in Spanish, originally came from fishermen off the coast of South America who noticed warmer seas at around this time of year."

            "text": "Once Santa\u2019s route has been determined, it\u2019s plotted on the Met Office weather graphics engine known as Visual Cortex. Visual Cortex allows meteorologists to visualise various layers of weather data on a 3d projection of the globe and animate sequences through time. These graphics are used routinely by Met Office weather presenters to broadcast forecasts for media customers as well as the Met Office app, website and YouTube channel. With two greenscreen weather studios in operation at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter, as well as an interactive touchscreen, ad hoc weather broadcasts can be recorded and posted quickly when severe weather hits."

But he has given us permission to post regular updates of his route every Christmas Eve, which we call the Santa Tracker,\u201d says Mark Wilson, who oversees the Media Services Team. \u201cThe Santa Tracker is just a bit of fun but it does encourage a lot of engagement on social media.\u201d"
