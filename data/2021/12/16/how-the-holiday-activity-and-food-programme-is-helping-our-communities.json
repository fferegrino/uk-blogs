We speak to Jamie Noble, Head of Community at Rotherham United Community Sports Trust, on the provision he runs, and the impact it has made within the area."

We saw a tangible difference in the children who participated in our summer schemes, and how they grew with confidence as the weeks went on, particularly when it came to developing social and leadership skills."

The groups we work with include our Disabled Supporters Group, our Youth Forum, and the graduate programmes that we run at Rotherham United Community Sports Trust. The activities we eventually run are centred around what these stakeholders advise. We also make sure to cater our format and timings, as well as facilities and locations, to make sure all children who take part in our provision are offered a range of accessible and enjoyable activities."

            "text": "Jamie: Definitely. We know that the school holidays can be especially challenging and expensive, so we believe it\u2019s really important for the whole community that we provide this support for local families. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to unite and get behind a positive area wide initiative."

Thanks to HAF, we now have a lot more freedom in this area, along with the ability to think outside the box when providing additional opportunities to the children who have not previously had them over the last few years."

We found that the majority of working class families wanted the same opportunities as other families, and didn\u2019t want their children to be attached with a stigma of free school meals."

            "text": "We have worked a lot around integrating these children into the activities that we were already running, and trying to provide the necessary support without it being too obvious. For example, we provide meals for all participants in the same format as the paying families, so that children don\u2019t think \u2018why do they get that and I don\u2019t\u2019, which was a common theme on our first camps."

            "text": "It feels more important than ever to provide support to families and alleviate some of the social isolation at this time, especially over the festive period, as we have been able to incorporate it\u2019s theme and the community spirit it generates into lots of our activities, as well as organise some special one-off events that get wider families involved. This programme is also a great way for local authorities and providers to maintain contact with particular groups over this period, helping ensure that all children are safe and looked after over the school holidays."
