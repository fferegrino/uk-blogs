My work with Companies House stems from the senior leaders of our organisation meeting to discuss ways to improve efficiencies through collaborative working, both internally and with other parts of government."

Register reform will not just impact HMRC and Companies House; it will have a positive impact on the wider UK economy."

It\u2019s a simple and sensible concept included in the register reform consultation which proposes that company accounts should be filed in one place at one time, and then that information can be reused across government. This links to the UK government\u2019s strategic direction around data sharing and how to make the most of it."

At HMRC, we\u00a0already\u00a0receive\u00a0XBRL\u00a0tagged\u00a0documents\u00a0and we recently consulted on\u00a0Making Tax Digital\u00a0for Corporation Tax. \u00a0Collaborative discussions\u00a0with Companies House\u00a0about your digital journey, help ensure\u00a0that inefficiencies aren\u2019t created. For example, we need to make sure that our timelines, taxonomies and IT proposals\u00a0align. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot of integration needed and it\u2019s amazing how you don\u2019t realise how much you need until you start having conversations with each other and get the right contacts involved.\u00a0"

The data on the Companies House register alone is worth billions to the UK economy, so there\u2019s a lot of valuable information there that we can use. We\u2019re trying to do this by establishing data gateways where we can exchange information and if we can share data more freely it will minimise the potential for fraud."

We\u2019re a revenue generator for the government and that income is translated into schools, hospitals, public services, roads and so on. One of the reasons I joined HMRC was because of the public benefit mindset and it's something that's important to me, not only as an HMRC employee but also as a member of the public."

Delivering value for money has always been extremely important to us and as public sector department, it's a fundamental consideration in any decision-making process when using public funds. It doesn\u2019t matter where you are in government, we\u2019re all accountable for how we spend public money. We\u2019ve got a joint aim to administer our systems in the most efficient way, which provides savings for our users and for the public purse."

HMRC and Companies House are both trusted holders of information, so protecting customer confidentiality is hugely important. We need to ensure that we continue to prioritise and protect this when we share data."

We both play key roles in helping to achieve the wider government's economic aims and the objective to combat economic crime. But I think there's even more we can do to protect citizens and to make sure that our information supports better business decisions and helps the economy."
