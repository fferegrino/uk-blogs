These digital services make up around 4% of services on GOV.UK. The rest are much lower volume \u2014 they typically have fewer than 10,000 transactions per year, and still solely use PDF or other document-based forms to collect information from users. In most cases, these don\u2019t meet the Service Standard. They are usually inaccessible, hard to use and, on average, 8 minutes slower to process compared to online forms. We want to help all services to meet the Service Standard."

            "text": "Meeting the current Service Standard requires a multidisciplinary team. This refers to the various digital, data and technology (DDaT) roles that have the necessary specialist skills to understand how to meet the Service Standard. These teams typically cost around \u00a31 million per year. This approach is great value for higher volume services, where there are big time savings that come from making them easier to use and run."

            "text": "For medium volume services, teams across the cross-government form-building community have continued the work that the GOV.UK Submit team started. There\u2019s now an established model of DDaT teams working with operations teams for between six to ten weeks, using form-building platforms to create simple digital services which meet the Service Standard. This typically costs between \u00a340,000 and \u00a392,500. This approach is great value for medium volume services, where they can\u2019t usually afford a DDaT team for more than a month or two."

            "text": "We heard one story of an operations team that wanted help to become more digital, but then went quiet once they found out the costs. They had no option but to continue running their service using PDF forms attached to emails. We think this is a significant reason why 96% of services on GOV.UK still solely use PDF or other document-based forms to collect information from users, which usually don\u2019t meet the Service Standard."

We hope these changes will enable these services to quickly start using online forms by making sure it is always simple, quick and affordable for operations teams to follow the principles behind the Service Standard. We believe these basic principles should be embedded into form-building platforms which are aimed at people who aren\u2019t DDaT specialists who run services with fewer than 10,000 transactions per year."
