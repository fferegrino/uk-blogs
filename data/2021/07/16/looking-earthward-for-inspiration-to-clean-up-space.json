            "text": "At the recent G7 summit in Cornwall, G7 nations published a joint statement committing to the safe and sustainable use of space in recognition of the growing hazard of space debris and increasing congestion in Earth\u2019s orbit. This proliferation of space debris leads to higher risks and increased costs for satellite operators individually, as well to the environment holistically."

            "text": "Addressing the requirement to return environments back to their natural state is not without precedent on Earth. Industries on Earth already consider how to deal with assets that pose a danger to the environment once they have reached the end of their operational life. The process, known collectively as decommissioning, is undertaken across the oil and gas, nuclear and offshore wind industries."

            "text": "Putting this in a space context, we consider decommissioning to include removing satellites from operational service and returning the environment of Earth's protected orbits to its natural state, through either re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere or moving satellites to a graveyard orbit."

            "text": "Decommissioning can be undertaken either using a satellite\u2019s own propulsion capabilities, outsourcing to third party debris removal services, or through passive decay for satellites operating at very low altitudes."

            "text": "The complexity, and therefore cost, of satellite decommissioning may vary dramatically depending on the asset\u2019s health and capabilities at the time of decommissioning. In practice, satellites are not always decommissioned and can remain in critical orbits for many decades. The case for decommissioning is clear. It can:"

            "text": "With the growing awareness of the need for effective decommissioning practices to ensure a sustainable future in space, there is an opportunity to learn from other industries much more evolved in their thinking. In space, as in other industries, assets historically have not been designed with decommissioning in mind, rendering decommissioning more complex and costly."

            "text": "Across all sectors, decommissioning requires significant innovation and novel engineering approaches. To address this, decommissioning on Earth is often outsourced to specialised third-party providers. Decommissioning across extreme environments presents similar challenges and a compelling opportunity for cross-sectoral learning between space-faring nations, industry, and academia."

The satellite industry can learn from other sectors and integrate decommissioning practices into the satellite life cycle to ensure a more sustainable future both on Earth and in outer space."
