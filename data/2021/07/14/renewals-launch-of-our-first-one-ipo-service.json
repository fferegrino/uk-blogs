After trialling our new digital Renewals service for 18 months with a limited group of customers, we have opened it up for everyone to use. In this blog, Peter Slater, Project Lead, reflects on the launch of the new service, and how it sets the stage for IPO\u2019s digital future."

We recognised that the existing service was outdated and difficult to manage, both for customers and ourselves, and needed updating. We implemented a newly-designed, simple and intuitive Renewals service to help businesses and individuals maintain their IP rights easily, to avoid losing them."

The new service reduces the time a renewal takes to process from five days to five minutes. The new service also introduces automated email responses for correspondence, receipts and certificates . A significant improvement on letters and postage stamps!"

The service also includes online checks and validation to reduce errors and speed up the process."

In January we ran into some issues which caused errors or delays in the processing of some renewal payments.\u00a0We pulled together an incident team to help resolve this issue as quickly as possible for our customers. I\u2019m happy to report that these issues have now been resolved."

This means that our approach will be led by customer needs \u2013 each part of the \u2018One IPO\u2019 service will start by asking customers what they need from it. As the name suggests, \u2018agile\u2019 is also about moving quickly, and responding when we identify problems. We\u2019ll be taking note of customer feedback and will be open to changing our approach and adapting when needed."
