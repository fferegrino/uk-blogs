            "text": "We want farmers and land managers to be involved in this work for a number of reasons. It's important that the rules not only make sense, but that they work in practice. Working together in this way gives us a clear sense of the support people need to comply with the rules. It also ensures that the rules are achieving the intended outcomes."

Some processes and guidance in these areas are overly complicated, onerous or costly."

            "text": "Good management also protects the environment from loss of excess nutrient which can contaminate the air, soil and waterways. Livestock owners need to manage slurry and need enough storage so they don\u2019t have to spread it at inappropriate times."

Nitrogen-rich fertilisers applied to soil contribute 90% of Nitrous Oxide emissions from agriculture. Agricultural emissions also account for 88% of the UK\u2019s total ammonia emissions (2016), of which 23% comes from inorganic fertiliser application, 25% from manure and slurry application and 9% from manure and slurry storage."

As it stands, it is hard for farmers, inspectors, and other stakeholders to do this with ease. Many report that processes are burdensome and mistakes are easily made. This can result in harsh penalties which feel unfair."
