The Skilled Worker visa replaced the Tier 2 General work visa, introducing new minimum salary criteria and the ability to \u2018trade\u2019 certain requirements - such as your qualifications - against a lower salary in order to qualify."

The deadline was written into legislation and there wasn\u2019t time to design and build a completely new interactive eligibility tool, so we needed to work closely with our Home Office content, policy and operational colleagues to make the most effective changes we could using standard (what we call flat) content."

It was during one of our pair-writing sessions that we queried the need for a link to this separate guidance. In the past, adding a link had been the only way to make sure users had all the relevant information. Pair writing allowed us to accurately interpret the policy, so we could remove this unnecessary complication in the user journey when we wrote the new content."

We saw that users frequently clicked back to the \u2018overview\u2019 or introduction chapter of individual visa guides from later chapters, and in some cases they clicked back up to the browse level navigation to review their initial options. This suggested that some users were not certain if the visa was right for them, based on the information in the guide."

            "text": "One of the most effective changes we made was helping people find out if their job is considered \u2018skilled\u2019 - and therefore, eligible. We added a link to the ONS occupation coding tool, alongside content explaining that jobs in certain \u2018occupation codes\u2019 are eligible for the visa. They can use the tool to find out which code their job is in, searching the database by specific job title or relevant keyword."

It\u2019s still early days, but it\u2019s encouraging to see that people are engaging with the tool, which suggests users are checking their eligibility before they apply."
