            "text": "Our most recent addition to the complex is bee hives. Around two years ago I began to develop a deep interest in bees and their decline. After quite a bit of research I noted we had the opportunity at Denver to really help the bee population; it was just a case of figuring out what we could incorporate to do more."

            "text": "Firstly, we successfully secured some funding to purchase and install some on-site bee habitats. These mimic a hollowed out tree and provide a safe and ideal environment for a colony of native bees to become established undisturbed."

            "text": "Once they arrived I was keen to learn even more, gaining knowledge and working towards the goal of ultimately becoming a beekeeper.\u00a0This was finally realised a few months back when I established the knowledge and confidence to build my first National beehive and transfer a colony of Norfolk bees into it. Coming from a farming background, I\u2019m quite used to the husbandry involved with keeping various livestock. However, I can honestly say there\u2019s nothing even close to the experience of keeping bees. It\u2019s quite involved, complex and there\u2019s a lot of science to it, but it\u2019s an extremely rewarding process."

            "text": "So far, I can take great satisfaction in reporting that the bees are growing and doubling each week. The queen is laying lots of eggs, it\u2019s a healthy colony and I\u2019ve increased the complex bee population by around 3,000 bees."
