In December 2020 DCMS awarded TRA \u00a33.5m to work with public libraries across England in taking on this challenge through its 'Read, Talk, Share' campaign."

Together we and our library partners\u00a0 mobilised to reach those most in need of social connectivity,\u00a0 overcoming the challenges of delivery in a pandemic, including the closure of library buildings and the difficulties of distance engagements. The flexibility, commitment and support of library staff and management to deliver this has been amazing."

One library user described the impact of the collections, saying: \u201cThese books are truly amazing and will be a godsend in my local area, especially as people\u2019s mental health is so poor at present due to the pandemic.\u201d"

Health support in public libraries, amplified through partners, can create real systems change in public health and wellbeing. This creates a clear legacy for libraries, helping them embed their health offer as a vital part of community public health provision."
