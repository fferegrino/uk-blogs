        },
        {
            "text": "But this underline can look quite different across different browsers. Most browsers make the line too thick and too close to the bottom of the text. This can distort the overall shape of the words, which can make them harder to read. This can become a problem on pages with lots of links, like search results or navigation pages."

            "text": "We looked at different workarounds to the default styling. These were heavily inspired by this  CSS tricks article about styling underlines on the web. After weighing up pros and cons we settled on an approach that would enhance the experience for lots of users without adding too much code or being too hacky (and over-complicated)."

Whilst this doesn\u2019t fail the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard, it is a usability issue that disproportionately affects users with impaired vision."
        },
        {
            "text": "We started by looking at how other websites treat hover states. As well as a change in colour, it\u2019s common to remove the underline on hover (or add one if the link doesn\u2019t have one). But we found that might not work so well whenever the link colour needs to be the same as the rest of the text \u2013\u00a0for example, white text on a blue background."
        },
        {
            "text": "So we decided to make the underline thicker when users hover. This draws much more attention to them and echoes  the way we treat focus states . We used the text-decoration-thickness CSS property to change the width of the underline - this only recently received wide support across browsers."

The working group is a multidisciplinary panel made up of people working across government. They help us sense-check our designs and make sure they\u2019ll work for teams in all departments. The working group reviewed 2 iterations of the changes to links."
        },
        {
            "text": "Early on we were concerned that the thicker underline is not currently a common convention for hover states. But we felt it solved the problem we identified and the working group backed the approach. Since then, we\u2019ve also noticed similar styles starting to be used in parts of the BBC News and Guardian websites; so it may become more widespread in the future."

        },

            "text": "We did this because there are a couple of very specific bugs in some browsers that will affect some services more than others. Once browsers have fixed those bugs and we\u2019re confident the new styles will work for most teams, we\u2019ll switch the feature on by default in a future release."
