            "text": "For Plymouth, NAAS enables us to focus on and engage with the post-qualifying standards (PQS). The PQS are the legally mandated professional development framework for statutory children\u2019s social workers; and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a national understanding of that, including at university and local authority (LA) level."

These pathways are a process for managers to decide whether social workers are ready to demonstrate their expertise and take the assessment. Plymouth has designed 3 endorsement pathways:"

            "text": "After endorsement, candidates are asked to complete a self-assessment of their learning needs and are then given one-to-one dedicated support to address these in readiness for the assessment. They also have the option to attend a workshop and are given support to understand how the assessment works and how to prepare. Receiving personalised support helps the assessment feel less daunting."

            "text": "NAAS refocuses thinking and reminds social workers to undertake more research to inform their approach to situations. They become more motivated to learn about aspects of practice they may not have been aware of previously and develop new skills through training. Ultimately social workers become more aware of what the PQS require them to know and do, which helps support their development planning and gives a renewed confidence."

            "text": "By moving the main responsibility of NAAS and CPD to team managers, the intention is that they will facilitate CPD plans, monitor training needs, provide social workers with space to access training, routinely encourage assessment booking, automatically review feedback and revise learning plans. The idea is that the only direction candidates move, is forward.\n"
