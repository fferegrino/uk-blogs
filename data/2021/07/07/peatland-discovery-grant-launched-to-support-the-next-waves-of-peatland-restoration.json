With growing interest in restoring our peatlands, I am delighted to report that we are launching a new Discovery Grant today (7th July 2021) as a part of the Nature for Climate Peatland Restoration Grant Scheme (NCPGS)."

            "text": "The NCPGS is the result of a close and strong collaboration between Defra and Natural England.\u00a0 It has been informed by the knowledge and experience of many organisations and stakeholders. We have designed the scheme to facilitate and fund the restoration of 35,000 ha of peatland by 2025 and to secure 9MT of carbon in the process. English peatlands are estimated to contain around 584 million tonnes of carbon, but in their degraded state it is estimated that peatlands in England emit some 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year. We need and slow or halt that release of carbon."

It needs commitment from landowners and managers who need to work together across ownership boundaries, bring in additional finance and confirm how they will manage the land to maintain the benefits long into the future. The need to build capacity and confidence was a key finding of the Newcastle University study \u00a0Social barriers and opportunities to the implementation of the England Peat Strategy."

We have received a diverse range of applications, with ambitious proposals that span both upland and lowland areas. These have largely come from the established and experienced peat partnerships. Proposals include works to restore the waterlogged conditions essential to forming and maintaining peat, re-introducing Sphagnum mosses and other peat-forming species and tackling peat erosion. We are now evaluating these applications and will make further announcements once we have determined how the first round of grants will be awarded."
