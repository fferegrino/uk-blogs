The new process merges multiple identical records and removes deactivated-emails from our distribution list. This allows us to accurately measure the number of members, as well as measure engagement with the newsletter."

Importantly, it has allowed us to understand how users access the blog (i.e. via laptop or mobile) and optimise our site to give the best user experience. We also introduced our internal Horizon Scan, which tracks what is happening within the profession and allows us to deliver more relevant and exciting content."
