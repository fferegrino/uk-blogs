            "text": "Some media outlets are reporting claims that we have told councils that the Everyone In scheme is ending. The work of Everyone In is ongoing. We\u2019ve made huge progress to bring rough sleepers off the streets during the pandemic and this work continues.We\u2019ve been clear with councils and partners that everyone helped into accommodation must be offered the tailored support they need to move forwards and that no one should find themselves back on the street without this.Tackling rough sleeping and homelessness remains an absolute priority for the Government. We are spending an unprecedented \u00a3750 million over the next year, which includes further funding of \u00a3203 million directly to councils to continue the work to help people off the streets.We\u2019re funding 6,000 long-term move-on homes for rough sleepers by the end of this parliament, with the majority becoming available this year.This demonstrates our commitment to end rough sleeping within this parliament and fully implement the Homelessness Reduction Act."
