This includes full compliance for wastewater discharge permits and a 50% reduction in serious pollution incidents compared with 2012."

The successful Environment Agency investigation was the biggest the regulator has ever conducted, making clear that polluters will be made to pay for damage to the environment. Earlier this year Thames Water was also fined \u00a34 million and \u00a32.3 million for separate pollution incidents."
