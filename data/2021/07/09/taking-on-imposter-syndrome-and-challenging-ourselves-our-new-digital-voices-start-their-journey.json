Lockdown meant that our latest group of Voices were unable to meet up in person, but a recent online event offered those involved the opportunity to introduce themselves and share why they decided to apply for the programme."

            "text": "I\u2019m hoping that Digital Voices will give me the confidence to be me, to articulate my voice and to be more vocal. I\u2019m fairly new to DWP Digital, having started during lockdown. I\u2019ve only met my colleagues once and before then I really struggled to create a rapport. I\u2019m naturally an introvert, and I find it difficult to unmute during meetings and make my voice heard. Sometimes my thoughts are going at 90 miles an hour and my voice can\u2019t keep up with it. So I\u2019m hoping to work on removing those barriers."

            "text": "I am a senior project manager, and I do feel confident in my job, but I\u2019ve always struggled with imposter syndrome. What I\u2019m looking forward to is working with the Digital Voices group, I do still have that monster on my shoulder and it\u2019s something I want to work on. I\u2019m really interested in mindfulness and also the gender balance in our line of work, and I want to develop the skills to speak with others about that. Digital Voices is all about making relationships and supporting each other."

            "text": "I applied for Digital Voices because I wanted the opportunity to challenge myself and gain confidence, particularly with speaking to people from outside of my area of the business. If I can find my voice, I can then help to bring other people up alongside me as I\u2019ll have been through the process. I\u2019m very nervous but I\u2019m excited about the challenge and sharing my growth."

I joined Digital Voices as the thing I really struggle with is public speaking. I always think, do people want to hear my opinion? I\u2019m not always confident about putting myself out there, and I\u2019m hoping this will help me to start."
