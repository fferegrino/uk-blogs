            "text": "Many told us of their desire for reproductive health problems to be normalised, destigmatised and openly discussed. When they need help, they want to know when and how to seek appropriate care, and to have confidence the care they receive will be managed and communicated well."

            "text": "This feedback led directly to PHE\u2019s work to improve how we measure progress in reproductive health, how we communicate about it and how we support the health system to work better."

            "text": "But while we heard a lot of voices, the people responding didn\u2019t fully represent all parts of our society. Compared to the general population, we didn\u2019t get a representative number of responses from women who identified as Black or South Asian, those living in the most deprived areas and those over the age of 45."

            "text": "We know that not all people have the same experiences when it comes to their reproductive health and wellbeing. These variations are normal in any group of people. But what\u2019s not right is that women from certain demographic groups experience far worse outcomes in early pregnancy, infertility, maternity and gynaecological conditions."

            "text": "A recent study in the Lancet showed the risk of miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women. The most recent report on maternal death showed that rates were almost four times higher for women from Black ethnic backgrounds and almost two times higher for women from Asian ethnic backgrounds, compared to White women."

            "text": "People from ethnic minority backgrounds are also less likely to have a baby following fertility treatment. According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Black patients aged 30-34 have an average birth rate of 23%, compared to 30% for Mixed and White patients. While there are no definitive explanations for these differences, we know that Black patients start IVF almost two years later than the average patient. Why this is the case requires more research, but it could be due to barriers in accessing IVF services"

            "text": "Among lesbian and bisexual women, teenage pregnancy is higher than the national rate and cervical screening rates are also lower. There may be structural or social barriers that need to be addressed to ensure all people feel confident to access the care they need or choose."

            "text": "We also see differences among age groups, for example older women tend to have higher levels of unmet need for contraception and may not seek support for their changing contraceptive needs as they progress through peri-menopause into menopause. We know the pandemic has led to delays in access to reproductive healthcare for some people."

            "text": "But many of these disparities existed before and have been exacerbated over the past year. The root causes are still not well understood despite being visible for some years. \u00a0To help us find solutions we need to better understand women\u2019s experiences by asking them directly."
