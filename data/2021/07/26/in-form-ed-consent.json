It\u2019s been fraught with difficulty, you\u2019ve finally completed it and submitted the disposition for registration, only to be told the consent or certificate it took you so much time and effort to obtain is not sufficient to get past the restriction in the register."

            "text": "I can imagine the sinking feeling you experience at such times and, unfortunately, it happens all too often. Indeed, during the past year of lockdown HM Land Registry sent more than three times the number of requests for information (requisitions) relating to such consents or certificates compared to the previous year."

If the seller\u2019s representatives sent you the consent or certificate before completion do you go back to them, or contact the person directly whose consent or certificate you need? Will anyone be interested? Will they ask you to pay their costs or an extra fee and, if so, what will your client say?"

            "text": "Although we use our expert knowledge, experience and judgement to make informed decisions, sometimes we are accused of not being consistent. Why did we accept one certificate but not another? The answer is that, in each individual case we assess, the risk of a consent or certificate later being successfully challenged may be quite small but scaled up over thousands of similar applications problems can arise. Occasionally people lose valuable interests they have protected and seek indemnity for their loss. The safest solution for all concerned is to make sure the consent or certificate is exactly what is required."

It is, however, a question of finding the right tool for the job, and in this case, the new form will help customers provide a consent or a certificate required for a restriction that is correct first time."
