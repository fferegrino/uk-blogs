Public bodies could apply for a share of a \u00a31 billion pot to install low-carbon technologies. They include; heat pumps, energy saving measures such as insulation or double glazing, or measures enabling low carbon technologies to be installed, such as metering or electrical infrastructure.\u00a0 Funding has been allocated to more than 400 projects which are now underway, and which in some cases have already been completed."
