We have a group of Beta authorities who are working with us to test the service, provide feedback on how best we implement this such as training and guidance but also help us understand how they communicate with agents. Each authority we have spoken to has provided really useful insight and this isn\u2019t just a one-off conversation \u2013 we want to keep working with them as we continue to develop the Appeals service."

This is something that is owned by each authority but user research confirmed that this is the place that appellants will often start from. We have worked with our Beta authorities to understand whether (and what) we might be able to change based on the research \u2013 watch out for a future blog on this area."

Although we are looking at different elements of the wider planning journey, we are looking at opportunities to join up and also share experiences."

Our assumption that the needs may differ dependent on the regularity of using our system is something that we are testing through our user research. We want to build a network of agents that we can work with on an ongoing basis so if you would be willing to help, please let us know at appeals.feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk."
