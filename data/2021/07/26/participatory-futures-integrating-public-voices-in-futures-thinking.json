This was one of the findings from GO-Science\u2019s recent report with the School of International Futures, Features of effective systemic foresight in governments globally. Participatory Futures enables this integration and it was also a popular topic in this year\u2019s Global Foresight Summit. We recently had Laurie Smith from Nesta host a masterclass on participatory futures techniques for the UK government\u2019s Heads of Horizon Scanning network. This is what Laurie said about participatory futures:\u00a0\u00a0"

It found that even then, nearly two thirds of the UK population felt uncertain about the future and more than half thought that the world was changing too quickly."
