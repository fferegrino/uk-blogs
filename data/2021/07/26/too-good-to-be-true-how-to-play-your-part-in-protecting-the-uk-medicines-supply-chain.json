We have previously covered qualification of suppliers, customers, phishing emails, and fraudulent websites , however, the risk to the supply chain remains present. We intend to provide further guidance on how you can remain vigilant so you can identify examples of the types of products and offers that are high risk. The MHRA is committed to providing guidance to industry and to supporting our stakeholders."

            "text": "GDP requires companies to implement effective procedures for the qualification and re-qualification of suppliers and customers. Robust qualification checks provide reassurance that medicinal products are being procured from reputable sources and are only supplied to customers who themselves are authorised to be in possession of medicines. So, what due diligence, as a licence holder, should you be considering when wholesaling medicines?"

            "text": "There is always an element of risk involved when adding a new supplier, or even when an existing supplier is expanding their line range. We expect that potential risks are identified and mitigated using robust supplier qualification checks, which take into consideration the suppliers themselves as well as the products on offer. For example, high-value low-turnover products may pose a particularly high risk. Often those are products that we would only expect to see in a hospital environment or intended for supply to hospitals. Recent non-urgent information requests issued to distributors highlighted products - including Betmiga, Eliquis, Entyvio, Flutiform, Gilenya, Isentress, Privigen, Seretide, Somatuline Autogel, Stelara, Xarelto, Symbicort, Synagis, Tysabri, and Zebinix \u2013 which had left the legitimate supply chain and been reintroduced."

Weak due diligence checks increase the risk of introduction of falsified medicines into the supply chain. Failure to identify and report suspicious activity to the MHRA will lead to regulatory action being taken against your licence, which may lead to licence suspension and/or removal of the responsible person (RP)."

As a matter of course, all home-based staff should be included in training in relation to their activities and the requirements of GDP and be subject to review by the Responsible Person on the self-inspection programme.
