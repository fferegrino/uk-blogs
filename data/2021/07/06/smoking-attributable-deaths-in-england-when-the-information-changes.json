It had been estimated that half of lifelong smokers would die as a result, but a 2015 study suggests that the figure might be as high as two thirds. So why have the estimates of the number of deaths and hospital admissions caused by smoking gone down?"

For these conditions, it is possible to calculate the risk of them occurring in smokers compared to non-smokers. This is called a relative risk and is specific to each disease, age group and sex. To work out the fraction of deaths and admissions attributable specifically to smoking we combine these relative risks with the most recent smoking prevalence for each local authority."

The previous relative risks were based on data from 1982 to 1988. \u00a0Since then a variety of studies have been undertaken that examine to what extent smoking is a risk factor for a number of conditions. Using the latest scientific evidence and especially the report Hiding in Plain Sight (HiPS) from the Royal College of Physicians, our estimates of the number of smoking related deaths and hospital admissions are lower than in the past."

The RCP\u2019s HiPS report was published in 2018 and was a monumentally thorough recalculation of the risk associated with smoking in the UK that made us wonder if it was time to update our calculations of smoking attributable deaths and hospital admissions. We consulted on our initial proposals in September 2020 and after a 5 month consultation, we published our response."

Not long ago, more deaths in England were caused by smoking alone than by alcohol, obesity, drug use and AIDS combined. Last year about as many people in England died from smoking as died from COVID-19. As the number of smokers declines the total burden of death and disease in England will fall too."
