We want to provide and validate data across our portal and Business Gateway channels earlier in the conveyancing process. This will help our customers to complete and submit applications right the first time. Fewer errors will improve the speed of registration by reducing the number of requests for information (requisitions), which incur unnecessary costs for all."

The new enhancement automatically pre-populates certain data from the register, while on-screen guidance helps customers to reduce mistakes, ensuring applications are correct and complete. Some restrictions will apply as we continue to develop the service, but ultimately it will replace the existing electronic Document Registration Service, which relies on scanned copies. We expect Document Registration to be decommissioned in 2022 but we\u2019ll provide customers with notice of this change, well in advance."

New areas such as lawyer assurance are also being explored. This concept gives a conveyancer a unique digital identifier so they can attest that the information lodged is accurate. This process does not require conveyancers to do any more than normal. It simply guarantees the information digitally and reduces processing time."

We\u2019ll be sharing more details about our planned service enhancements in the coming months, as we transition from paper-based electronic processes to digital. And we\u2019ll continue to update you on the progress of the digital solutions and tools we\u2019re exploring, which all fall under the theme of digital registration, something you will hear us talking more about. All of which takes us closer towards our ambition of becoming the world\u2019s leading land registry for speed, simplicity and an open approach to data."
