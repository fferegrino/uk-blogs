The department delivered its biggest and best GAAD events yet and had over 2,250 registrations of attendance across the sessions."

It is a service team\u2019s responsibility to make sure government services work for everyone and user research plays a key role in achieving this goal. Teams need to listen and reflect this in the way they build and design services. You need to recruit users with access needs and find how assistive technologies may interact with your service. Such users provide insight based on lived experiences and provide invaluable input into services and support models."

Legal changes such as these can make service owners, managers and their teams feel isolated, and unsure of where to turn for advice. This year, HMRC recognised that many government departments were in this position and ran a cross-government assistive technology audit demonstration to show what considerations it makes when building services. The session received positive feedback with some saying they will reflect some of HMRC\u2019s techniques in their own audits in the future. The session is now available to view via YouTube."

A cross-discipline event was also organised, which explored the culture of inclusivity and accessibility across the organisation. No technical knowledge was required, just an ambition to improve and an enthusiasm for collaboration."

A space which provides equipment and technology to help build an understanding of different assistive technologies and their uses.

Attendee feedback commented that seeing and hearing a real person use the technology enhanced their understanding and significantly impacted their view of what \u2018assistive technology\u2019 was and what it meant to users of it."

Essentially, everyone should strive to make something that as many people as possible can use in an equal and equitable way. There will be technical challenges and complexities during the development process, but by engaging with people who have both lived experiences and subject matter expertise, teams can truly begin to build inclusive and accessible services that not only comply with regulations, but also embody the values of government organisations."
