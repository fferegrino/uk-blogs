It is a huge moment as they consider the options available to them and celebrate their successes. It\u2019s also the culmination of all the hard work teachers have done to make sure that our students get grades that reflect their performance."

As we prepared students for final assessments, they were made fully aware that the work they were producing would be informing part of their teacher assessed grade and could therefore prepare accordingly. We held online Zoom meetings with parents and had open and honest discussions with students about the importance of each assessment."

Each assessment and student was scrutinised and discussed at length before the final grades were determined. When our Exams Officer clicked the \u2018submit\u2019 button on our final grades I felt a huge sense of relief - I was confident that we had done everything possible to ensure the fairest possible process for all our students and that there was nothing more we could have done."

Now that the grades have been submitted, we have passed the golden baton onto the exam boards who are beavering away behind the scenes checking school samples and policies before the final grades are released on 10 and 12 August."

This cohort have faced unprecedented challenges and not only should the results days be a time for rejoicing at final grades, we should also recognise how our students and teachers have worked tirelessly to overcome every challenge thrown their way."
