But don\u2019t just take our word for it. Here, our series of features in which employees reflect on what makes Companies House so special continues with Senior Systems Analyst Louise O\u2019Connell."

There\u2019s work to be done, important work at that, but it\u2019s not like one of those high-pressure organisations where you have to put your hand up just to ask to go to the toilet. I\u2019ve seen that kind of working environment and it\u2019s horrible. Companies House is the polar opposite.\u201d"

Would the culture be better there than it is at Companies House? I seriously doubt it. Would the people be better? I doubt it again. Why swap the wonderful working life that I have for a couple of quid? There\u2019s a bigger picture to think about. Hand on heart, I\u2019m very happy to be where I am.\u201d"
