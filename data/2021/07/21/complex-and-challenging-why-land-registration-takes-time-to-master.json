Our aim for 2021/22 is to optimise our operational capacity and we are recruiting a further 650 members of staff, including directly into the executive caseworker grade, with more than 1,200 members of staff receiving technical training during the course of the year."

This gives a general grounding and the ability to work on specific casework types according to the caseworker\u2019s grade, but there will always be a need to refer complex, knotty points of practice to more senior colleagues."

It is a skilled job and takes patience, practice and support."

In April we launched the Land Registration Academy, which will provide a foundation and framework to develop and increase knowledge and expertise. Currently, 600 colleagues are upskilling through the range of methods the academy offers."
