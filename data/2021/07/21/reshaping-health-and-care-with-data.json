It has shown that better use of data and technology has the potential to empower individuals to take control of their own health and care, help them to live independently, and give social care staff an accurate view of the people in their care."

In this blog, we look at the potential of data to help each of these in turn:"

This revolutionised the speed at which health and care staff could access health records, with an individual\u2019s consent, wherever they were in England."

We need everyone involved in a person\u2019s care to be able to see not just past health history, but also future care preferences - only then will citizens have a joined up experience. And only when citizens have access to records and care plans themselves will they become real partners in their own care."

This knowledge will help to personalise care and drive preventative measures that reduce risk, and minimise incidents and accidents for individuals."

            "text": "There is now widespread evidence that data from assistive technologies, including room sensors, activity monitors and alarm systems, can help provide 24-hour background support, while enabling individuals to live independently. These innovations also give carers and family members reassurance about their wellbeing and safety \u2013 and some degree of respite from caring responsibilities."

For example, by understanding how many people in an area have long term health conditions and the care support they need, Local Authorities can coordinate with community health and voluntary sector organisations to put the right services in place."
