For example, the service is set to become even more accessible by offering users the opportunity to buy a digital fishing licence. This will allow anglers to always access a valid copy of their present fishing licence on their phone, saving both paper and time. Users will also have the option of the automation of expiry reminders and multi buy features for those buying more than one licence at a time."

Solely funded through fishing licence fees, the Check Fishing Licences app has been developed to reduce the number of lengthy calls to the Incident Communication Service who check the angler database on the enforcement officer\u2019s behalf. It also provides a safer way for our enforcement officers to check licences on the bankside."
