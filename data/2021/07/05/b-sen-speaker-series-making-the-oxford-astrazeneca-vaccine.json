Join us in warmly welcoming Prof. Catherine Green, and tune in to learn all about how she led her team in making the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in the early days of 2020. This talk is open to all departments, including those outside of BEIS. Here is a blurb from Professor Green of what the session will cover:"

I will describe some of the previous work that enabled us to develop this vaccine so rapidly, and the path that was taken to later scale up, large late-stage clinical trials and eventual emergency use authorisation of this vaccine now in global deployment against Covid-19. I will also comment on the challenges of trying to respond to a pandemic while in a pandemic, and highlight some lessons learned along the way that will hopefully prepare us better for the next one."
