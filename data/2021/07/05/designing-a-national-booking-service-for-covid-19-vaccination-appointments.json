We knew it was coming but we didn\u2019t know which would land first, when and what the clinical requirements around administration would be. We did know we were facing a national-scale roll out with an ambition to get every adult in the country vaccinated as quickly as possible."

The service design and technical architecture was worked on in parallel. Neither view of the world took priority over the other, ensuring decisions about the service were made with both technical integrations and user experience top of mind. This approach enabled us to deliver at pace and really showed us how architecture and service design should work."

While each team had its own ceremonies and cadence based on what met the team\u2019s needs, we joined up on ceremonies like retrospectives, show & tell and planning to ensure we didn\u2019t lose sight of the end-to-end journey."

With this work, we were carrying the uncertainty of which vaccine would land while also working within emerging policy thinking on how the roll out would be managed across the population. This resulted in frequently changing requirements that would inevitably impact the service we were designing and the resulting user experience."

            "text": "This made user research recruitment a challenge. We didn\u2019t know what the policy would be around who would receive the vaccine first so we made educated guesses, ensuring we tested with different groups throughout. Throughout the delivery we carried out 5 rounds of user research with the over-80s, health and social care workers, trans and non-binary people and people who were classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. \n"

We didn\u2019t assume that only certain people should be asked the question based on gender / sex. So to make sure the service was inclusive and safe we asked the question of all users. This was tested with a range of users including over-50s, men and trans women. It tested well with everyone. \n"
        },
        {
            "text": "We also resisted repeated requests for users to be forced to provide a mobile number or email address or to implement strong authentication into the service. We wanted to be sure that we met our goal of designing an inclusive and accessible service that ensured people could be vaccinated as quickly as possible and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to introduce these potential barriers."

Our product teams quickly prioritised the backlog using our goals of maximising vaccination uptake, usability and safety as our \u2018north star\u2019. The team, having previously worked on the NHS website, was highly skilled in deploying changes to a highly visible, high volume service at short notice. The practice of multiple, daily, controlled deployments meant we could implement prioritised changes into the service at an eye-watering rate. Inevitably, some things didn\u2019t go exactly to plan, but the team were able to respond, fix and recover the service, often without users really noticing."
