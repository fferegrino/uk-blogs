I'm relatively new to DWP, 2 years last week last week. In fact, moving to Civil Service has been a huge change for me. From a niche scientific research area with broad industrial applications to a department supporting over 20 million people. Retrospectively, I definitely arrived at the right time.

Our data strategy plots out the journey we need to take from having lots of fantastically rich data spread out across multiple silos, to unlocking the potential of this data by implementing an enterprise-wide approach to data architecture and modelling. Improving the quality and interoperability of data across these silos and unlocking the potential for advanced analytics to support the department's strategic ambitions around automation and personalization.

On its way, depending on the quality and the end purpose, it may go through some transformations, for example, cleaning and reaching, standardising and in some cases aggregation. In the analytical domain, we then use this data to optimise the business. So for example, resource planning or delivery and improve the customer experience."

But as we went more digital and moved more of our services online, and with the change in the business model for the welfare services, so for example, like Universal Credit, the volume of data has changed significantly, and so did our appetite to use raw and bigger data."

This comes with its own challenges and many big organisations experience this. The challenges come from the necessary wrappers around the data like governance or security and permissions, storage, and scaling the access to data, but also cost."

We've created a service that allows separated parents to apply for support in claiming child maintenance. When this application was made over the phone, it was a long conversation with lots of questions. Once we'd created the online application form, we could identify where changes needed to be made. This form would ask a series of questions about what the regular childcare arrangements were for each child in turn."

But through practice, or better said mis-practice, I acquired a taste to enjoy the data exploration, although I still see it as the least exciting part of the process. So, the most obvious ones to me are related to the early stage of the data exploration because that is the foundation of your work and small mistakes or assumptions will propagate and reverberate and then can amplify actually throughout the project."

So to fully understand the purpose and the method of data collection, understanding if the data is pertinent and suitable to the process you're modelling and if the process that drives the data is consistent. A good example would be the COVID-19 crisis where almost every service provider had to change their normal service delivery. And this is one year worth of data with discrete incremental changes that will transpire through it. The next one would be probably data smoothing and cleaning. And this is a pretty big one for me, especially if we talk about data modelling, the majority of the systems we try to model will be nonlinear. And while I understand that linearity is intuitive and drives actionable results, I'm careful with it especially when the data relates to people and complicated business processes, because life is most likely not linear. The last one is consider if the data sample is representative. This is especially pertinent for interpreting results and the purpose of your data investigation. Context matters. There are 2 main aspects to consider - the evident technical aspects, so is it really statistically representative? But also the ethical considerations. And working for DWP and working with such dynamical data and such diverse data, it is very important to take these things into consideration."

I normally look for irregularities and document it if there are processing blips, if there are noise or an important part of the process that just looks a bit off or a bit different. And if it is or not pertinent to my investigation. It is an important part, but also this becomes part of the story I need to tell the stakeholders because very rarely a bar chart will be powerful enough to deliver the full image."

The outcome of this is often retrofitted analytics or putting Google Analytics on at the end and using lots of proxy measures to stand in for real data. We're really keen to use the data that we need to measure the success of the things that the teams are building. We don't just want to figure out some measures or a dashboard from the data that's available at the end."

We workshop with teams about the purpose and goals of the service that they're building. We break this down by aims for the department, such as less phone calls or faster processing time, and aims for the citizens such as the shortest time possible to process a claim and not having to repeat the information they give us."

So if on day one, everything goes live and it all falls apart, what would that look like? How would you know that something was going wrong? And sometimes failure just isn't just the inverse of success. And sometimes that can be easier to measure. So you can measure what you don't want to happen, as well as what you do want to happen. By following this process, it helps us to define what measurements and metrics are really important and will actually show us if the service is succeeding in meeting those goals that it set out at the beginning."

As Olga mentioned earlier, the way that we previously worked with data was to try and collect data and store it centrally. But this ended up with trying to make the data warehouses a bit of a jack of all trades. It also left other teams with small islands of siloed data that can't be shared with each other.

So responsibility for the data will lie with the product teams who create the products, enabling them to use the technology that they choose. At the same time, the central teams who currently run the data stores will still provide some structure and building blocks that allow products to create data that is able to be shared and used in the right way across other products in DWP. So we could use data from Universal Credit, for example, to help us to reduce the number of questions a citizen had to answer in a health application."

At the moment, we have to make bespoke connections to any data that we want to use. And it makes it almost impossible for us to join and to process the data that we need. With the data mesh, we will be able to access and govern data via connections that are standardised. This will allow us to use the different datasets and combine them to show a huge range of use cases beyond what we can at the moment. For both operational data that we need to process claims and for data that we use for analysis, it will open a wealth of opportunity for innovation and change the way that we work at DWP, ultimately making things better for the citizens that have to use our products."
