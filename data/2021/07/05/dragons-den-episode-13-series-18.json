From an app that tracks carbon footprint, to reduced-sugar jams and a patented pooper-scooper, the Den was set alight with intellectual property\u2026but which inventions had the Dragons chomping at the bit?"

Darren first appeared on the Irish version of the show 13 years ago where he successfully secured investments from three Dragons. But would he repeat his former success?"

            "text": "This time around, the charismatic Irishman was seeking a \u00a350,000 investment for 10% in his company Nobu Pets Ltd. The product that he was keen to demonstrate was the Potty Mouth, a sphere-shaped pooper-scooper which distributes its own, biodegradable dog waste bags."

            "text": "Darren explained that the idea came to him while watching his children picking up snails in the garden with a broken tennis ball. In his pitch, he announced that the product had a patent for its biodegradable bags and the method by which they are distributed."

To be granted a patent, an invention must be all of the following:"

            "text": "Touker however, who\u2019s been building a portfolio of pet businesses over the past year, expressed a desire for new and innovative products like the Potty Mouth. He offered all of the money for 35% of the company (reducing to 30% if he makes his \u00a350,000 within 18 months). He also promised to help with sourcing and distributing. Visibly delighted, Darren scooped up Touker\u2019s offer."

After expressing a particular interest in Tej and Peter before entering the Den, the duo pitched their blue light screen filters and requested \u00a375,000 for 5% in the business."

            "text": "After an interesting discussion on how blue light from screens affects our eyes, skin and melatonin levels, Sara was quick to turn the subject to IP. I was pleased to hear that the pair had spoken to a patent attorney early on in their entrepreneurial journey."

            "text": "The patent attorney had explained that, unfortunately for them, there wasn\u2019t anything defensible that could be patented when dealing with waves of light, therefore making the patent easy to get around.

It also offers your customers assurance about the nature of the product or service they will receive. Trade marks are a vital component in setting up a brand and are in place to protect your identity by distinguishing your goods and services from that of your competitors'. You can learn more about trade marks in our online trade mark guidance."

            "text": "As hoped, the pitch hooked both Peter and Tej into a ferocious bidding battle and tempers flared. Requiring both Tej\u2019s health care knowledge and Peter\u2019s experience in distribution, the duo cleverly diffused the situation by offering the Dragons the opportunity to work together for 7.5% each in the business."
