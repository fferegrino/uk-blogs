            "text": "The job of an SBI in my county was to work four days a week from May through to August - I thought this would allow me to become semi-retired so I applied, even though I was not sure if the job was for me or that I had the right experience. I was elated to receive an invitation to the National Bee Unit\u2019s headquarters at Sand Hutton near York for an interview. The interview was a combination of identifying bee disease and non-native pests as well as a practical test of our skills at a hive site and a verbal interview."

If a photo is not enough or if I think there is a problem, I will arrange a visit. Our target is three apiaries a day, conducting thorough disease inspections on a minimum of 15 colonies so I can drive many miles a day as Wiltshire is a big county."

            "text": "When not responding to calls, I choose areas for selective visits, usually those near to disease hotspots. BeeBase (our online bioinformatics database) shows where there have been disease incidents and the location of other apiaries in the area. Fortunately, most people are happy to receive a visit and to be assured that their bees are healthy."

            "text": "Some beekeepers are a little nervous that I may tell them off or give them a lecture, but it is not my job to tell anyone how to keep their bees \u2013 my primary role is to look for notifiable diseases and pests and help to eradicate them if they are found."

            "text": "Throughout my first season, the regular meetings with Peter Davies, the Regional Bee Inspector, and my fellow Southern Region SBIs were invaluable. As we work mostly on our own, it is useful to meet colleagues face-to-face to swap information and advice. I am always impressed with the depth of my colleagues\u2019 knowledge. They are always keen to share news and views on the latest research and initiatives. They all care very deeply about helping beekeepers and improving the health of our bees."

It is potentially a threat to our UK honeybee population and other native pollinators."

            "text": "It was a stark contrast to the first year that had been so sociable. Most beekeepers allowed me access to their apiaries but kept their distance so there was no help lifting the hives, which can get heavy as they fill with honey. It was also pretty eerie driving around the countryside on empty roads. Occasionally I would be at the bottom of a garden inspecting bees and a face would appear from a back window of the house shouting questions at me. Goodness knows what the neighbours must have thought!"

The training for bee inspectors never stops and there is a programme of continuous professional development. We also work towards a formal City & Guilds qualification."
