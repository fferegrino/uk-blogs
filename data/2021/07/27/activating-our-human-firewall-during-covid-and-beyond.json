At the MoJ my role is essentially to activate our human firewall, by reinforcing positive security behaviours in our workforce. This helps to ensure the sensitive data we manage on behalf of the vulnerable people we serve doesn\u2019t get into the wrong hands, and to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe."

It requires regular care from the top down, as it is not something that grows in a positive way by itself. An organisation\u2019s leaders need to invest in it."

We\u2019ve produced a range of new good practise guidance on remote working. However, it's people who can make or break security."
