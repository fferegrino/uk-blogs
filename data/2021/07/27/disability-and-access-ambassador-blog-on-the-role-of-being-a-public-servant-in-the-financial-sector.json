Particularly in being able to advance the social model of disability in financial sectors that have tended to view disability through a medical model lens.\u00a0"

            "text": "Awareness of non-visible or hidden disability was low. The culture has been greatly influenced by a regulatory and compliance focus on \u201ccustomer vulnerability\u201d. I hope I have made a noticeable change to this agenda, and this has been reflected in awards I have received."

            "text": "My most significant work in the role has been to build and lead a highly collaborative cross insurance sector coalition, the Access to Insurance Working Group.

These will significantly improve consumer transparency and give disabled customers the ability to access the insurance guidance, advice products and services that they require.\u00a0"

            "text": "I am also pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Mental Health UK, the National Aids Trust and various other disability and medical charities. We have worked to share consumer lived experience of applying for insurance, and to improve industry awareness, and as a consequence consumer support, experience and outcomes. This has had a particular focus on consumers with mental health lived experience, and those living with HIV.\u00a0"

We have increased awareness of the Disability Confident scheme, developed inclusive workplace guidance and improved access to insurance via the workplace.\u00a0"
