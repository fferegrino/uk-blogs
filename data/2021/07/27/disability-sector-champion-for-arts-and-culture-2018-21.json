The scheme also offered the Government valuable insight and a proximity to lived experience of disability."

The role enabled me to shine a spotlight on the key issues, using the platform to get behind great innovation such as the National Theatre\u2019s Smart Caption Glasses or to call out outdated and poor practice."

This initiative will have a tangible and long lasting impact on disabled people\u2019s everyday engagement with culture. The measure has the support of all four UK Arts Councils and it will be needed more than ever as arts venues build back audiences after the pandemic.\u00a0"
