But it is precisely as policymakers are trying to pin down the intent, that uncertainty is at its highest. This makes policy inception some of the most exciting and most difficult work that policymakers do."

This is problematic because sometimes the intent gets drowned out, instead of maintaining a crystal clear focus on delivering an outcome for the public.\u00a0"

            "text": "There is also particular frustration felt by colleagues who work on the delivery side of government who say that sometimes commissions can contain prescribed solutions that may not deliver the public value expected. These commissions often have baked-in unproven assumptions on what is needed and how deliverable it is. This stores up risk and leaves the potential for a nasty surprise later on when it is discovered that something else could have delivered much better public value."
