            "text": "The premise of the show is, as the name suggests, to find love. The couples fight it out to bag the \u00a350,000 cash prize. As only one couple can win (or one person if they decide to \u2018steal\u2019 the money), the show ends with most contestants leaving empty handed. That is, of course, until they leave the villa and begin to capitalise on their new-found fame."
