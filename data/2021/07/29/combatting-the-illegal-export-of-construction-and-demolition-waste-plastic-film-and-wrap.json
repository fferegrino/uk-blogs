This material is increasingly being exported from England under \u2018low risk\u2019 Green List waste controls when the level of contamination we are observing means those exporting such waste actually require prior consent from us and overseas regulators. When they don\u2019t obtain consent, the export is illegal!"

Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste is exported from the UK each year and it is the responsibility of our officers to inspect shipments and to prevent its illegal export."

However, this year alone my colleagues and I have seen a marked increase in the number of shipments of this waste which is contaminated and therefore requires prior consent to export. The plastic is often dirty and contaminated with materials such as mud, sand, rubble, and bricks which means the waste will require further treatment after export."

We also recognise the importance of maintaining a \u2018level playing field\u2019 so those investing significant financial sums in their businesses, are not unfairly undercut by those not properly dealing with waste. However, we can only achieve so much on our own and we want to emphasise how important information provided by the public and those in the industry is in tackling the issue."
