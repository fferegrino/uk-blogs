As well as covering the \u00a3860 million in 1,000 flood defence schemes this year, the article highlights the improvements to flood insurance to encourage the installation of flood doors, air brick covers and flood-resistant plasterboard in homes previously damaged by water, and the forthcoming consultation this autumn."

The Guardian highlights the government\u2019s plans to invest record funding for flood defences in England while The Yorkshire Post takes a similar position noting the \u00a3146m investment to bolster Yorkshire's flood defences. The Evening Standard focuses its coverage on the new investment in flood prevention schemes across the UK over the next year, which the piece notes, comes as heavy downpours battered the country. Environment Agency Chief Executive Sir James Bevan was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme about the announcement."
