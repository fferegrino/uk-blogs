Between 100 and 200 bathing water samples can arrive each day and once registered it\u2019s over to the Microbiology and Molecular team - that\u2019s where I step in. It\u2019s my team\u2019s job to test the water for two types of bacteria that can indicate pollution in the water."

It\u2019s really important that they\u2019re kept cold and they arrive within this time otherwise the bacteria can change and that means the results won\u2019t be accurate. When the bottles arrive, we can\u2019t see what or how much bacteria is in the water, so in very simple terms, it\u2019s our job to make it show up."

To help the bacteria grow, we create real-life growing conditions by incubating the agar samples at different temperatures. It then takes about 48 hours for the bacteria to show up."

The test results are also used to classify each of the designated bathing waters. There are four classifications; Excellent, Good, Sufficient and Poor and are these are based on how much bacteria we find in water. The majority of bathing waters in England have a very high standard of quality. Anyone can find out the classification for their local bathing spot by visiting the Swimfo website."

Action plans can then be put in place including work with local partners to help drive improvements to local bathing waters."

The Environment Agency uses Met Office data to make pollution risk forecasts to work out when water quality might take a temporary dip due to factors such as heavy rain or high tides. Most bathing waters have a consistently high standard of water quality, but at some it can go up and down \u2013 this is where forecasting works best."
