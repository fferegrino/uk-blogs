It also covers infants who have acquired HIV through vertical transmission. The report focuses on maternity data for women booked with an estimated delivery date (EDD) in 2019."

For infants born to undiagnosed mothers, the main issue was seroconversion, meaning the women acquired HIV infection later during the pregnancy or while breastfeeding."

A reliance on screening results from earlier in pregnancy also appeared to influence clinical diagnosis and care for unwell infants."
