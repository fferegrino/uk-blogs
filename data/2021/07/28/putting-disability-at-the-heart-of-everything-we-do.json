Many of these are aligned to the priorities I have set out in my role as Civil Service Inclusion Champion for Disability. They include; supporting leaders at every level to change behaviour and remove the barriers our disabled colleagues experience, increasing development and progression opportunities for existing civil servants who have disabilities and long-term health conditions and for those wishing to join, and working as a collective to improve IT accessibility and interoperability."

In an interview panel or an event, ask whether or not disabled people are positively represented. When introducing new systems or processes, question if they can be used equally by everyone. When producing communications, think through how accessible your communications are and make sure accessibility is part of your standard practice, and not an afterthought."

There is a wealth of information on everything from becoming disability confident, workplace adjustments, flexible work arrangements, to mental health awareness and disability awareness. In particular, disabled colleagues have consistently cited to me that their line managers\u2019s confidence and approach has been critical to getting the best out of them, so if you're managing someone with a disability, I strongly urge you to take up these learning opportunities.\u00a0"
