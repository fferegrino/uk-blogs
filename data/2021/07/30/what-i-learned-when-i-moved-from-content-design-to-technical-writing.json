            "text": "Content designers write more generally for pretty much everyone else who needs to get something done with government. For example at GDS, content designers write a huge range of content to help users do everything, from applying for a driving licence, to knowing what you can and cannot do during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, to getting a general understanding of GDS services like GOV.UK Pay."

For example you\u2019ll find technical content on GOV.UK for tax specialists, or for technicians doing an MOT. A content designer or a technical writer could work on technical content, depending on the department. But in this blog post, we\u2019ll focus on digital technology."

We write very technical instructions on using application programming interfaces (APIs) and include detailed code examples. One of the best ways to check what we write is to actually start up the technology and try it out ourselves."

Our writing process is not very different to content designers: we use plain language, write short sentences, create a clear heading structure and so on.

But - despite those stark industry survey results - it feels far less likely you\u2019ll see a technical writer on a team than see a content designer. Content for citizens has come a long way since Sarah Richards wrote about the editorial approach for GOV.UK back in 2013, but I\u2019d argue that content for technologists has some catching up to do."

I\u2019ve been a passionate coder since my mum and dad got me a prized ZX Spectrum for my seventh Christmas in 1983.

So it\u2019s a slightly gentler step from content design than the documentation writing I do.\u00a0"
