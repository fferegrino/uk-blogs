            "text": "Awarding organisations, colleges, training providers, schools and employers have been working hard to offer functional skills assessments that are safe and convenient for learners throughout the pandemic. This is incredibly important for learners hoping to complete an apprenticeship or progress in their chosen careers. Functional skills qualifications provide evidence of a student\u2019s achievements relevant to the workplace."

            "text": "Evidence shows that both traditional and remote assessments are taking place at an increasing rate as workplaces and training providers re-open. Since March, nearly 525,000 functional skills assessments have been completed through traditional face-to-face assessment. And since January, more than 50,000 functional skills assessments have taken place using remote invigilation."

        {
            "text": "In some cases, learners have been offered face-to-face assessments, but have been unable to take them up. This may have been because they were shielding or isolating, or because they were anxious about potentially contracting COVID-19. Ofqual\u2019s regulations enable awarding organisations to offer remote assessment and remote invigilation. The increased use of these methods has meant that many of these learners have been able to take assessments outside of an approved centre, such as at the learner\u2019s home or an employer\u2019s premises."

            "text": "Latest data also shows that many apprentices who were past their planned end date and needed to achieve a functional skills qualification have been able to complete their programmes. This is due to a combination of factors, such as flexibility introduced by ESFA allowing end-point assessments (EPA) to be taken before FSQ assessments, lockdown restrictions easing, greater use of remote invigilation, and collaboration by employers and providers to accommodate safe face-to-face assessments."

            "text": "When done well, remote assessment and remote invigilation allows learners to take a valid assessment which may otherwise have been delayed. We have seen some excellent examples of where both have been used, such as cameras controlled remotely by the assessor being used to observe practical assessments. More simple solutions \u2013 such as the use of web-based applications \u2013 avoids technical issues for learners who may otherwise have had to download software."

And they can be asked to hold photo ID in a specific space so that a photo of the learner with their ID can be taken and stored. Use of multiple cameras has also enabled awarding organisations to prevent learners being helped by third parties."

For both on-screen and paper-based examinations we have maintained our high level of scrutiny and we are confident that all of our assessment options effectively serve to identify and mitigate risks or potential breaches of examination conditions.\u201d"
