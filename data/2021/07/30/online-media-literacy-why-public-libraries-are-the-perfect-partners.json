Equipping citizens with media literacy skills is another vital way to ensure everyone is able get the most out of all the internet has to offer, whilst also making safe and informed decisions online. Understanding the media ecosystem, both online and offline, is a key part of life as a citizen in a 21st century democracy.\u00a0"

But reading also equips us with other essential skills: it enables us to look at things from other perspectives, teaches us to check sources, question an author\u2019s biases and critically assess information. These are all important media literacy competencies. By improving our powers of comprehension and analysis, reading enables us to identify misinformation and disinformation, recognise bias and spot satire."

One of the initiatives set out in the Media Literacy Action Plan for 2021/22, is to upskill library staff and ensure they have the confidence to offer support to the people who use their services to build media literacy skills. This includes developing their resilience to misinformation and disinformation, understanding how to keep personal data safe online, and promoting positive interactions with others online. These are vital skills for all citizens.\u00a0"

From an Online Media Literacy Portal, to working with tech companies to implement features that promote media literacy on their platforms, to supporting public service workers to deliver media literacy support to the people they work with, we are committed to ensuring that everyone has the skills and knowledge they need to stay safe and thrive online.\u00a0"

This initiative will enable libraries to increase the support they already provide to the public with information literacy skills and knowledge. We are excited about working closely with public libraries across England as key partners in driving this agenda forward.\u00a0"
