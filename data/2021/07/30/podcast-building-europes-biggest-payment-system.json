But obviously now moved on to the Digital Payments Service, as Natalie was articulating at the beginning, something that is again, another significant challenge and roll for me."

We wanted a payment service that looks at reducing cost and risk, but also increases the resilience and simplicity and flexibility of payments to and from the citizen.

            "text": "Before I get into the technologies, I wanted just to set the scene as to what we're trying to do within the departments, in technology in particular. So the Department for Work and Pensions is on a journey where we're looking to modernise our digital services, and in particular to support our business intent of providing where appropriate, our services digitally. So that's the overarching challenge for is on the technology side. So what the department has done through our technical department, digital department is that we have a number of key principles to support the intent of providing our services digitally."
        },
        {
            "text": "So these are some of the key design principles. So one of the key ones is that it's going to be micro services based. And by that we mean that we will develop small independently standing services that will provide one function or service. One of our other key principles is that it's going to be event based. So rather than building big batch based systems, there is more events based so the information transactions APIs moving around the service, as we move forward."
        },
        {
            "text": "I think we've already covered within this series of podcasts, about interfaces and integrations. So one of the key design principles there is predominately API based and overarching all of these is that we are definitely looking at developing reusable services. So, rather than developing small independent services and one offs, that we are looking where we can to develop reusable services, so as Nat has articulated in payments, we provide a payment service for the whole of the DWP systems. So that's what we're trying to do and it's a good example of where we're providing a reusable service. So rather than each of our systems having its own payments service, we're developing one generic payment system. So that's quite critical."
        },
        {
            "text": "The other overarching principle is that we're moving away from where we used to provide or host our services in house, within our own data centres. We're now definitely moving to the cloud and one of our key design principles is having a cloud hosted. So we're looking to use things like people are aware of AWS, Amazon Web Services, and some of the other key providers, Azure, and I don\u2019t know another one or two I can't remember. So, I'm just setting the scene before we get into the key technologies."
        },
        {
            "text": "So, they're the key design principles. What the department has, through the main architecture community, we've got a number of reference architectures. So we've developed an application reference architecture, which describes our applications, again are services based, so we have an application reference architecture."
        },
        {
            "text": "We also have a technical reference architecture. So that's a more detailed technical level, and articulate or identifies the key technologies that we're going to be using. The final one is we have something called the tech radar, which is a series of recommendations to the department about the key software components and capabilities that we can use. So really, just setting out the frameworks and the design principles for developing our services to support that intent of providing our services digitally."
        },
        {
            "text": "So getting a bit deeper in terms of the software. Within the Digital Payments Service, our key software languages are Java, and Node JS, or Node JavaScript. So they\u2019re our two main languages, key languages. For Java, we predominately use the Drop Wizard framework. It\u2019s a like work framework for building APIs and web applications. For front end development, we use the FreeMarker templating language. On the Node JS development side, we use the Express Framework."
        },
        {
            "text": "And it's interesting, that obviously people who are digitally literate are going, \u201cWhy are we not using some of the more modern available things like React or View?\u201d But our view is that, you know, we're looking to provide generic services, digital services to our citizens. So the ones that are particularly towards rather than ones that are available on the internet, that we've got more control about and gives us that flexibility and assurance of service as well."
        },
        {
            "text": "On the operational side, we have a number of monitoring alerting tools. We use Prometheus and Grafana, and Alert Manager and again, that allows us then to tap the flexibility about monitoring our services, so we're not dependent on some commercially procured software."
        },
        {
            "text": "I think the other final one before getting on to the actual hosting side is that we have a number of databases, but the one that we've elected to go with is MongoDB. That's what we would call a NoSQL database. Our background is predominantly using Relational databases, but we think that moving towards the NoSQL database gives us more flexibility and control over our databases moving forward. So this is definitely moving into the new modern paradigm of doing development work."
        },
        {
            "text": "So, I think it's worth exploring now about how we actually support these services, and actually how we host and what our approach is. So, my experiences working with the department for the past 35 years, is that initially, historically, we used to provide our data centres in-house. So we actually had five data centres in the old, old days where we used to provide all our benefit processing systems. Then in the late 90s, we moved from an in-house to an outsourced supplier. So actually that was service was provided to us, by initially, EDS, and then it was Hewlett Packard. So it was definitely an outsourced model. And five years ago, we made the decision to bring the hosting back in house."
        },
        {
            "text": "So initially, we provided again, our own data centres, and we refer to that as being on-premise hosting. But obviously, the IT industry in general has being moving more into the cloud and we have again made that decision that we will now move from on premise hosting, to in the cloud, and for me, based on you know, that background where we used to provide our own services, and then we outsourced it. Moving into the cloud, which I do have some experience of, for me is mind blowing. It's actually a quantum leap and the power and the flexibility and the cost efficiencies and the speed of delivery, is actually quite staggering, and it is actually changing the delivery of IT and underpinning a lot of what is actually going on in the in the IT sector in general. And it's quite exciting for the department to moving into that."
        },
        {
            "text": "Within the department, we actually have a number of cloud providers. So we haven't just picked one. So we have an Amazon Web Services, AWS, we have Azure and we still provide a number of our services in house as well. Some of our more secure ones in on premise hosting in OPH."
        },
        {
            "text": "On the payments, the digital payments, we are predominantly using AWS. And the benefits for us are significant. First of all, they provide a number of all-encompassing services. So when we go into AWS, they're providing all the wraparounds, sort of the security frameworks, the operational frameworks to actually support those. So in terms of the alerting. So a lot of that is given to you and my trick as the lead architect is making sure that we're using the right services, that we're getting the right information, monitoring the right things and then again, from a security perspective, making sure we're implementing the right security framework to make sure that our services are secure, but also so that people can access them in the appropriate ways."
        },
        {
            "text": "The real benefits for me about using the cloud, AWS in particular, is the way we can start small, if we so desire quickly then scale up when we've identified a way forward. And one of the big things for us is the capacity on demand. So that we can, you know, when we have quiet periods, we can ramp down our services and then when we actually have busy periods, we have lots of transactions, we can ramp up those services very quickly indeed. In the old days, when it was on premise hosting, we would have to put an infrastructure in place that what we would term should actually cope with the highest volume. So potentially, you know, we have a lot of kit, but that kit is not being used, but we still have to pay for is capital expenditure. With the cloud, we can ramp up and ramp down those services, depending on the volumes going it through a very quickly and that leads to a much more cost effective approach and that is significant for the for the department."
        },
        {
            "text": "Another benefit is and again, my experience is when we were putting, when I was on the regional payment service for the department, say 13 years ago, putting that infrastructure in place, you know, you literally started with a blank sheet of paper and when you want to put some hardware in place, you've got to procure it, you've got to get the funding for it and then you have to implement it and deploy it into the data centre. That could take months to actually do, whereas something like using the cloud it\u2019s literally available on tap and again, I can't emphasise to me better my experience is mind blowing the power and the flexibility. And it is a quantum change for the IT industry and something that the department is now really tapping into, and it's going to have significant benefits for us going forward, in particular that digital journey, providing our services digitally for the British public."

We started out by holding a number of workshops with the key payment industry stakeholders. We shared our findings from our discovery that we did at the start of our transformation work early last year. We share our needs as a payment provider and we've also shared the challenges and goals that we want to achieve within our vision for the future. The stakeholders that we met with along the way have been Pay.UK, Vocalink along with our payment service provider and government banking services, and a number of other government departments and we've all played a key part within our transformation journey."

And being part of regular working groups and consultations that potential changes for the future, we can start to influence and allow the needs of our users and citizens to be met. It can also allow us and hopefully will help solve some of the challenges that we see today within our current constraints of the schemes and formats that currently underpin the way that we make payments today.

We're further ahead in our transformation journey, we started it quite, you know a number of years ago when thinking about what it is that we need, not just today, but for the future. It's had its own challenges in allowing us to kind of have our voice heard at the very start, but in forming relationships with other government departments, we've actually found that we all have the same problems when it comes to some of the challenges for our citizens.

So they have that as that base.

So we are trying to influence and be involved in that conversation. So I think one level, that our new approach that myself and Nat were outlining before, the reference architecture, these design principles of micro services based in APIs, they're meant to underpin so that as these new banking innovations come through, that we can intercept with those in a much more cost effective, flexible, timely fashion."

And the critical on the underlying philosophy is that, you know, we can't lose a payment, we need to make sure that we make our payments on time and securely to our customer base, that\u2019s quite critical."

So to make sure that the services we do build are secure and can cope with the volumes going through them. Now, we've actually started developing some of those services\u2019 capabilities already. So we're starting to develop things like bank validation, remittance calendar services and I think we made an excellent start."

So I think that's the key learnings. It is a positive that it is the right way forward. And now it's actually about building it at scale, both in terms of the volumes and the functions and services."

And just being part of that, you know, gets me so excited and, you know, really trying to articulate really the vision that we're trying to achieve and the journey that we're on. You know, it's exciting, but it has its hiccups along the way but it's been really, really rewarding. Knowing that you\u2019re solving problems for real people just is such a really nice place to be involved and work within."
