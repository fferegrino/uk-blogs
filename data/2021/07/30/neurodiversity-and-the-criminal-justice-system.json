So, the court setting, and the fact that the probation service become involved very quickly after they\u2019ve been convicted of an offence can be very stressful for them."

We have had to do the majority of our work remotely which means interviewing offenders over the phone and by video links. This has been challenging\u202fin regards to\u202fcommunicating and building up a trusting relationship for people to discuss sensitive issues. We are, however, able to do this by continuous communication including sending text messages to remind them of appointments."
