It\u2019s so important that we practice what we preach and make sure that the NHS is an inclusive place of work for the 1.3 million people who work there."

Now that I\u2019m Secretary of State - first Secretary of State at DHSC from an ethnic minority - I will do everything I can to make sure the NHS is free from discrimination."

            "text": "The plan demonstrates that where an NHS workforce is representative of the community it serves, patient care and the overall patient experience improves, and we\u2019ve seen through our vaccination programme the importance of our diverse workforce in encouraging uptake in communities with lower uptake."

            "text": "It was upsetting to see that across almost all indicators, BME doctors reported a worse experience at work compared to white doctors, and that even when BME doctors become consultants, they continue to report greater levels of discrimination and harassment and that they felt less involved at work."

            "text": "I\u2019m determined that we must address this, and I\u2019m encouraged that the MWRES sets out a number of areas where we can take action. These include gathering better data, more targeted communications and greater diversity leadership levels."

            "text": "These are positive steps, and I will keep pushing this agenda, which is close to my heart. Because the NHS is one of our most cherished institutions, and we must make sure that everyone who works there get the appreciation and the care that they deserve."
