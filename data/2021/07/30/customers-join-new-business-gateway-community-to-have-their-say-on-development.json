Our developers presented an overview and demonstration of the first new service, which enables users to see which official copy documents are available to order, and if they\u2019re available for immediate download. We ran breakout sessions to invite input on the priority features for a new Developer Hub for customers \u2013 the aim of which is to make it easy to integrate with our APIs. Customers highlighted the importance of receiving clear and comprehensive documentation, access to a more advanced test environment and better transparency around system availability."
