This means that while the second-hand car parts market is a huge area of potential for the used car trade and circular economy, for us at eBay it also raises a host of regulatory issues."

By informing sellers to display their permit numbers, or the name of the site where the parts were sourced from means more transparency while enhancing trust for purchasers. This single collaborative action between us and the Environment Agency has an immediate effect on the level of compliance rates; sellers are not allowed to sell vehicle car parts on our platform without holding an environmental permit."

A pop-up message is also displayed once sellers list used vehicle-parts within the listing process. In addition, we have organised a massive sellers\u2019 outreach programme in order to highlight that an environmental permit is needed to break vehicles; sellers are directed to GOV.UK where they can get further information."

They are not allowed to trade on our platform without an Environment Agency permit in place."
