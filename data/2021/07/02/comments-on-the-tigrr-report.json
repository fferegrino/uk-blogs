            "text": "The government is planning to reform its approach to regulation to ensure that the UK takes advantage of the opportunities offered by our exit from the EU and to ensure that we regulate in a way that is as effective as possible, promoting innovation and growth. The RPC strongly supports these objectives. We see our role as helping the government deliver better regulation through ensuring that policy properly considers the costs, benefits and risks of different regulatory and non-regulatory options."

            "text": "Regulation and the regulatory policy-making process can have a significant impact on individuals and businesses, and it is important to think strategically about how we assess different policy alternatives. The Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform (TIGRR) report, published last week, makes a significant contribution to that debate. This blog post covers our response on aspects of that report that relate to regulatory processes and the Better Regulation Framework."

            "text": "In the UK we are considering reform from a position of strength \u2013 our current systems are highly regarded internationally \u2013 but there is undoubtedly potential for us to improve further in pursuit of regulating in a way that achieves the government\u2019s objectives while minimising the burdens on UK businesses and civil society. We also recognise that government is concerned about more than just the impacts of its policies on business \u2013 for example it needs to consider the impact on the environment, our health and safety, and economic growth."

            "text": "The TIGRR report makes a case for enhanced Parliamentary scrutiny. We see Parliament as a key \u2018customer\u2019 for our opinions and would welcome a greater focus on the impact of proposed regulations in Parliament. We would be very pleased to discuss how we might complement any enhanced parliamentary scrutiny role and how we could work with select committees and others to deliver this."

            "text": "In our view, a decision on whether such a requirement would help should follow a decision on which metric is used to compare impacts. A metric that is narrowly focussed - for example, only considering the direct impacts on business or netting out gains and losses within a market segment - may conflict with other government objectives such as net zero, levelling-up and new free trade agreements."

            "text": "We would particularly wish to avoid a situation where significant policy areas were carved-out of the scope of the framework because they involve additional costs to business. Therefore, any new mechanism would need to be flexible enough to allow for multiple objectives."

As a direct result of our scrutiny, departments have adjusted some regulatory proposals to exempt small and micro businesses (for example, provision of personal information on consumer bills in machine readable format)."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report on regulation and competition also recommends that we should be able to red-rate IAs as \u2018not fit for purpose\u2019 based on their assessment of the impact on competition and innovation, while the Natural Capital Committee believes that we should be able to red-rate on the assessment of natural environment impacts."

Given the importance of these wider impacts to government policy, we would welcome a discussion of how the framework could be strengthened and extended."

This provides an opportunity to make changes to the way the independent scrutiny process works and to ensure that it is as effective as possible in delivering better policy-making and ultimately better policy. We therefore encourage government to take on board these comments as part of the review and we ask stakeholders to support this approach in their responses to the government\u2019s consultation."
