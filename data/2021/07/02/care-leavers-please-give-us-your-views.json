We want to hear from young people who are currently preparing to leave care, and care leavers aged 16 and over. If you\u2019ve already left care, we also want to hear about your experiences, even if you left care a long time ago. As a care-experienced person, I know the support you get when leaving care can have an impact on your life well into the future."
