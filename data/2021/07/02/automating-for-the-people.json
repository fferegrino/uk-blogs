Our aim was to partner with teams and organisations across Defra to build cost effective robot solutions that help those teams become more productive. Nearly a year on, this new and cutting-edge capability is growing and making a difference in ways many of our partners in Defra group couldn\u2019t have imagined."

            "text": "This technology enables our partners to use a software robot that will emulate and mimic them undertaking a business process involving IT systems at high speed and with flawless accuracy. In days gone by the word robot may have conjured up an image of a metallic, human-like figure, perhaps like the character C3-PO in Star Wars. Those days of robots being familiar, yet inanimate objects, are gone though."

            "text": "We partner with Defra organisations to help them understand whether they would benefit from having robot assistance, we help design the robot process and we\u2019re completely transparent on whole life costs and return on investment. We can then build and deliver their robot in high supervision mode and will support them once it\u2019s trusted and in low supervision. We can do all of this at a fraction of the cost of any digital experience they\u2019ve ever had."

It\u2019s their magic. So consequently, we see data as the risk, that the robot won\u2019t have the correct instruction and that data entered incorrectly can feed downstream systems and have negative consequences."

            "text": "With that in mind my team build pause points into the robot so that it can confirm with the user before it alters any data. This approach enables the users to get their robot new starter on the desktop in sprint 1 and safely begin to use, tease out what they haven\u2019t told us and live prove using real records. We can then safely move through the pause points in a process, hitting the user success criteria before moving the robot to low/no supervision mode."

But that\u2019s not the case at all. There\u2019s minimal upfront investment and no disruption to underlying systems."

A robot will use their user interface to capture data and manipulate applications, completing a process just like they would do. Robots require logic and rules and can perform a vast variety of repetitive tasks, just much faster and with 100% accuracy."
