In the meantime, we do everything we can to support law enforcement and other government organisations in their investigations into economic crime and fraud.

We raise referrals to The Insolvency Service, share public information and explain our reasons why we think there is activity that needs to be looked into so it can be investigated.

An example of how we have used this is when we identified an attack on redundancy payments. An organised crime group with what appeared to be shell companies and false identities attempted to steal a large sum in redundancy payments.

The Companies Act is an old and long piece of legislation reflective of the business sector in the 1800s. A lot has changed since then - society and technology has dramatically evolved but I do not think you can say the same for the Act. It has not changed that much and is not keeping pace. So now it\u2019s a big wake-up call and pressure from areas of government to say this cannot go on."
