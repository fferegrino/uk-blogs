It is a misinterpretation of the legislation to conclude that these access to information regimes, or any provision within them, are displaced by the prohibition on disclosure in the Environment Bill.\u00a0The provisions in the Bill provide by law that certain enforcement proceedings of the OEP are confidential proceedings of a public authority. This allows the OEP to effectively carry out its functions by establishing a safe space for dialogue with public authorities."
