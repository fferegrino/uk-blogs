The COVID-19 pandemic has taught me that I value direct human contact above everything else, as do most of my friends and colleagues. From a public health perspective, I hope our experiences of the past year and a half will make us more proactive in future pandemics."

The move to considering targeted screening for high-risk groups and stratified screening more tailored to the individual is one example. Similarly, the genomics revolution will also have a profound impact on the way we work in the not-too-distant future."
