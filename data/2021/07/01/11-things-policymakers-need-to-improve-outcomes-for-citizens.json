They looked at a broad range of evidence that combined hundreds of pieces of existing research with brand new ethnographic research about the day-to-day experience of policymakers across government."

            "text": "It confirmed what we already know, that policymakers are talented and caring people who are driven by a sense of public duty and they go to work every day because they want to make a positive difference to people\u2019s lives. But it also revealed that they don\u2019t always have what they need to make those outcomes as meaningful to citizens as possible."

Frequently citizens\u2019 individual experience of these global events cuts across several government policy areas. For the government to provide citizens with joined-up services, policymakers need to understand these complex systems and to collaborate across organisational boundaries."

            "text": "Policymakers told us they would be able to deliver better outcomes if they were commissioned to do their work in a way that explicitly focused on outcomes for citizens, instead of being asked to deliver part of a bureaucratic process. It is also very important for policymakers to think about all the different types of citizen who will use their policy or service so that they can ensure that no group is treated unfairly."

            "text": "UK policymakers are clear about how important it is to make policies and services based on good evidence. They regularly work with experts like analysts, economists and statisticians, but they rarely use citizen-centred, ethnographic research about the reality of people\u2019s daily lives. This means that there isn\u2019t always a clear view on the exact nature of what services citizens need or how they will respond to any intervention. Civil Service should make it much simpler for policymakers to find existing evidence about different types of citizens.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Policymakers also need to be able to easily create new evidence where there are gaps in knowledge. One of the most effective ways to do this is by working directly with the public to design, test and iterate policies and services at an early stage before the government commits to building or implementing them. There are some fantastic pockets of government that excel in this type of research like labs and What Works centres, but many policymakers have low confidence in working with the public."

            "text": "There has been lots of progress on diversifying the workforce in Civil Service but there is still more to do. Policymaking teams do not reflect the characteristics of the communities they serve. This limits their understanding of people that use the policies and services they make, and might have an adverse effect on how meaningful citizens find them."

Policymakers want to work in multidisciplinary teams with subject matter experts and technical experts but bureaucratic barriers like HR or procurement processes are just too slow for the pace of political work, so they just have to do without these helpful people."

This research reveals an untold story of how that unique and valued national institution works day-to-day. If we want policymakers to keep getting better at what they do - and in turn deliver even more meaningful outcomes for citizens - then we must invest in providing them with the tools and infrastructure to get on with their work."
