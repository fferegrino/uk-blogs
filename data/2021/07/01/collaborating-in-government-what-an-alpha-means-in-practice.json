The hard work itself has already been done over the course of Alpha. The assessment is the chance to showcase the journey you\u2019ve been on to a team of peers. The real challenge here is collating all the evidence you\u2019ve gathered and fitting it into a single peer review."

They interacted with user groups internally and at various banks to ensure they solved the problem for their users. This was done as the team searched for the best technological approach in an environment and culture unfamiliar with agile delivery. At the pinnacle of building that plane was the service assessment, which some of the internal team had never done before."
