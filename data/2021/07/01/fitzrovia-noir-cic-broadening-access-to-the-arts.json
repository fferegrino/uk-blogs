We relocated to Trinity Buoy Wharf where the River Lea meets The Thames. This proved to be a key move as we were then offered support from the Trust to establish an international residency programme. We invited artists originating from France, Denmark, Iraq, Korea, Morocco and Venezuela to create site- responsive work based around community engagement"

Our\u00a0'Lifelines' project was chosen by The New Economics Foundation as the central installation for their Art of Recovery conference at The Hepworth."
