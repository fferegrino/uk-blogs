A review into BPDTS recommended bringing the two organisations together, and since then we\u2019ve been working hard behind the scenes to make that happen. I\u2019m delighted to confirm that from today we will move forward as one."

I hope that by bringing BPDTS and DWP Digital together, we can continue to improve those services using our shared skills and experience, in order to deliver on our ambitions for the future."

Everyone across DWP is working tirelessly to get people into work and to improve their quality of life. Beyond that, we are also committed to the modernisation and digitisation of our services, and putting the user\u2019s needs at the heart of everything. That work is powered by the new unified DWP Digital, who are building joined-up, digital-first services shaped around people\u2019s life events."

Digital, data and technology are the essential drivers for those ambitions, and that\u2019s why we feel that now is the ideal time for us to create the biggest and best digital organisation in government."

To get to this point has taken a lot of work across both teams. We\u2019ve created five working groups that focused on the key areas that arose from listening sessions and discovery groups. These groups looked at our shared vision, smarter working, recruitment processes, people development practices and inclusion."

It gave us an opportunity to reflect and listen to people, to consider what might change, and what people value about their work. From there, we were able to agree on a set of principles for the ambitious, collaborative, people-focused organisation we want to be:"
