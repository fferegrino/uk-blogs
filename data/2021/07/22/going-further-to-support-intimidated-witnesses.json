            "text": "For many witnesses, the fear and stress associated with the investigation of a crime can be hugely difficult. This can then increase even further if they then need to attend court and give evidence at a trial. Some witnesses may find it especially difficult to do this due to a number of additional factors, including their age, personal circumstances, fear of intimidation or because of particular needs."

It allows witnesses to pre-record their cross examination before trial, regardless of the offence. This spares them the potential trauma of attending the trial itself in person, and in the presence of the accused."

            "text": "Last year, my colleague Trudy Lewis wrote about how this particular special measure has been rolled out to all Crown Courts in England and Wales to vulnerable witnesses. Vulnerable witnesses are defined as all witnesses under the age of 18, and those whose evidence is likely to be diminished by either a mental disorder, significant impairment of intelligence or social functioning, or a significant physical disability or disorder."

In 2019 this special measure started to be piloted for a subset of intimidated witnesses - complainants of sexual offences and modern slavery offences - at Liverpool, Leeds and Kingston upon Thames Crown Courts."

It\u2019s making such a difference, benefitting countless victims of crime. Since August 2020, section 28 special measures have been used to support over 1000 vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to give their best possible evidence. This ensures that the justice system is less daunting for those involved, and the feedback from those involved supports that."

I am immensely grateful to all for their vital support to victims and witnesses of crime. Working together, I am confident that we will continue to increase the support we provide, and transform the experience of our criminal justice system for some of the most vulnerable people in society."
