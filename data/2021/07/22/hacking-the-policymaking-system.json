            "text": "Most of the challenges Government faces or questions it needs to answer are deeply complex; for a policy to have impact its delivery will involve a diverse range of actors in multiple overlapping systems \u2013 institutions and organisations; places; communities of profession and practice. \u00a0It seems almost trite to point out that policy making in this context is going to be hard to get \u2018right first time everywhere\u2019 and so an adaptive mindset must be the goal \u2013 an approach to policy making that prizes feedback & learning; deep understanding of systems, places and people; the bravery to make space for co-production & iteration."

            "text": "It\u2019s instructive that I was asked to write this blog focusing on the way we \u2018commission\u2019 policy work. This highlights an immediate challenge - policy making in Government is still too often a linear process \u2013 an \u2018event\u2019 which starts within the Whitehall machine.\u00a0\u00a0 The operating environment for policy makers is one where ministers or senior leaders \u2018commission\u2019 (or initiate) policy work \u2013 perhaps in response to evidence of need; perhaps in response to external pressures or a crisis; perhaps driven by a process like a spending review or political announcement.\u00a0 It goes without saying that it is the democratic role of the Government and its ministers to initiate policy, and that drive can play a key part in over-riding inertia and driving ambition. But without care, details of the policy risk being predetermined from the top down at the outset \u2013 by the way the core \u2018question to be answered\u2019 is framed, by constraints applied (time, cost, assumptions) and by expectations stated or implied."

How might we change the way senior leaders commission policy work at the beginning of the process to drive better policy results? To help me in this task I took to Twitter and am grateful to all those who shared their views, the suggestions below shamelessly meld their ideas with my own (check out the original thread here)."

There are specific mentions for: multidisciplinary teams, evidence-led decision making and sharing data, public value, getting out of Whitehall, open collaborative policy-making, operating more seamlessly with institutions outside government, and building partnerships with the wider public sector, private sector and community organisations to secure the best outcomes for citizens.\u00a0 These are welcome commitments and in many ways map onto the suggestions I\u2019ve made.\u00a0 The question, as ever, is whether they will be implemented.\u00a0 To do so requires all those who initiate policy work in national government \u2013 the most senior officials, ministers and their offices - to genuinely embrace different assumptions and questions from the start of that process.\u00a0 Speaking from the outside, I sincerely hope they will."
