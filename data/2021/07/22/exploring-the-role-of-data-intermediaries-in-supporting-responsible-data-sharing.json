The individual is able to manage who has access to their personal data store, granting or revoking access to organisations such as GPs, banks, and online retailers, among others. SOLID, explored below, is one such example of a data intermediary."

In addition, data intermediaries facilitate data access and sharing for the purposes of analysis. This can include research in the public interest, supporting innovation in commercially-sensitive environments, and enabling the independent audit of data-driven technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of this opportunity, demonstrating how effective use of data can aid decision-making and produce social and economic benefits, which we explored in our COVID-19 retrospective."

We would be interested to hear views on the interaction between intermediaries and PETs. To what extent, for example, might PETs reduce how active intermediaries need to be in data stewardship activities? Are there use-cases where only third-party intermediaries can achieve the needed outcomes?"
