I swear they didn\u2019t come up for air. The wealth and depth of knowledge, and more so, the highly engaging nature of their conversation as they unpicked this gargantuan subject was just awesome to witness."

For the next seven years, I was riding on a jet stream of atmospheric science, computer analysis and fevered talk in the forecasting operations room, observing clouds with veteran Met Office people and just being at one with the weather."

My degree in maths and Masters in applied marine sciences at the University of Plymouth were a great platform to launch this dream."

Also, the inspiring HQ in Exeter is abuzz with cutting edge science, like a scene from Logon\u2019s Run (70\u2019s sci fi film). Meteorologists are a breed of their own. They transcend time, and the colleagues who I had the privilege to work with in back in the 90s were still there, making weather magic, not looking any different."
