They\u2019d been up all night, several nights in fact, frantically working to stop a small island nation from falling into chaos."

Since they\u2019d been called in to assist, they\u2019d had to combat increasingly complex cyber attacks on the nation\u2019s financial sector. Numerous banks were suffering from DDOS attacks, and hackers had infiltrated payment networks and begun making huge fraudulent transactions. At the same time cashpoints were being targeted with \u201cjackpotting\u201d attacks \u2013 where they spit out large sums of money at random."

We\u2019d all been called here as UK government representatives to help try and manage this crisis, and stood ready to use whatever political, diplomatic, or economic means we had at our disposal."

Recently though, the rivalry had become increasingly hostile, and the aggressive neighbour was now operating military forces pretty much on the other\u2019s doorstep; capitalising on regional instability as justification for enforcing their own objectives."

As we were briefed by the cyber experts on the ground, and heard first hand how they\u2019d fought to keep critical national infrastructure (such as power and water) safe from hackers, my uncertainty only compounded. We were in for a tough time, and I desperately needed another coffee."

I listened intently as my fellow teammates mused over the particular challenges posed by each new event. The situation continued to worsen, and our cyber counterparts were coming under increasingly sophisticated attacks, which were now beginning to affect essential services like power and water \u2013 and most concerningly, military systems."

Unsure of what I could trust, I tried my best to discern what was actually happening on the ground and realised again how dangerous it could be to believe everything we see and hear online."

You probably know yourself the frustration of not being able to get a mobile signal. I\u2019m figuratively lost without 4G \u2013 and if I am relying on google maps, then I\u2019m literally lost without it."

It also taught me how vulnerable we could be. It taught me how your enemy doesn\u2019t need to be on the doorstep armed to the teeth with tanks, warships, or aircraft, but instead they can be thousands of miles away and still do real damage from cyberspace."
