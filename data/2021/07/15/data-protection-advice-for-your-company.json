This funds the ICO\u2019s work. Paying your data protection fee means your company details will be added to our searchable public register and shows customers and business contacts that you\u2019re aware of your responsibilities. The fee applies no matter how big or small your company is, although not everyone has to pay the same amount. For most companies it\u2019s \u00a335 or \u00a355 per year, when they pay by direct debit."
