In 2020, 5,608 alcoholic liver deaths were recorded in England, a rise of almost 21% compared to 2019. This is substantially above pre-COVID trends - between 2018 and 2019 the increase was under 3%."

            "text": "PHE\u2019s report monitors changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic and shines a light on the possible reasons for the sharp rise in alcoholic liver deaths. Based on analysis of sales data in the off-trade and surveys, it identifies an increase in alcohol purchasing, consumption and higher risk drinking (35+ units per week for women and 50+ units per week for men) since the pandemic started. This rise has been driven by those who were already drinking heavily before the pandemic."

            "text": "Although alcohol-related cirrhosis may take over a decade to develop, people whose livers are already badly damaged can die when they suddenly increase their consumption. Because of this, liver mortality is a rapid indicator of changes in alcohol consumption among heavier drinkers."

It\u2019s primarily caused by alcohol use and obesity and most people with the condition don\u2019t know they have it until the disease is at an advanced stage. Research shows that people with advanced liver disease admitted to hospital in emergency are 7 to 8 times more likely to die than those admitted for stroke or heart attack."

            "text": "But the liver is an incredible organ. Stopping drinking alcohol, or reducing intake to low-risk levels, can halt or even reverse damage to the liver. Once people stop drinking, their long-term survival improves dramatically.\u00a0However, around one third of deaths occur before patients are aware of the risk and have the opportunity to stop drinking."

One study reported that around 40% of cirrhosis patients stopped drinking after a first liver admission.\u00a0 In a community pilot, 65% of harmful and dependent drinkers reduced their drinking after learning they were developing liver fibrosis."
