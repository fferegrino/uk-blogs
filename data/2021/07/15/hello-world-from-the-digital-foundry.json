From the first blog post with the Royal Navy, to the latest blog from Strategic Command, every part of Defence has got involved, with new digital communities being formed and synergies being realised.\u00a0"

So why is a Foundry needed now considering all these teams have been getting on with it already?\u00a0"

What followed was a discovery that explored the problem space and delivered a series of recommendations. These findings form the basis of the Digital Foundry, and the themes we plan to explore and develop going forwards.\u00a0"

By empowering\u00a0these\u00a0local teams with improved professional freedoms and greater collective responsibility, we aim to grow the user-centric benefits whilst fixing the de-centralised problems.\u00a0"
