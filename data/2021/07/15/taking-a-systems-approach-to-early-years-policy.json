            "text": "The commission explicitly called for the reviews to take a systems approach. This permits a team to cast off the organisational knowledge and customs of which a person interacting with the system from the outside would be ignorant. They can therefore come closer to inhabiting that person\u2019s experience of the system. It also gives them a mandate to investigate a whole issue and feel empowered to make recommendations that transcend organisational or political boundaries.\u00a0"

            "text": "When a commission doesn\u2019t do this, the default would be to examine the system as a collection of units (the independent bodies that form it), not a whole. The units could be within one organisation, or across an international playing field: seemingly unalterable realities of organisational responsibilities can exist anywhere, but applying a systems approach helps you to see past them to the outcome you want.\u00a0"

To make this happen, Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government's User-Centred Policy Design team and Policy Lab joined forces with the team.\u00a0"

Of course, Departmental lines have to be drawn somewhere. But we thought it seemed possible to make it easier for busy, tired parents of young children to find and use services without having to be aware of the way government is organised."

            "text": "We used empathy-building exercises and journey mapping to help the policy teams start to understand the mindset of the parent. Language and narratives significantly affect how we relate to ideas and so it was important to us to move away from formal statements like \u2018there is a variety of available services for parents of 2 year olds across the local authority area\u2019 to more grounded, practical questions such as \u2018what services are realistically likely to be used by a mum who works part-time and has a 2 year old?\u2019 or \u2018what if to go into town they have to take the bus?\u2019 Far from trivialising the issues, this approach helps policymakers keep focus on practical outcomes for people in the real world."

            "text": "We also emphasised that parents experience government services in a wider \u2018world\u2019 context that includes advice from friends and family, media and social media, publicly provided services, private ones and online information.\u00a0 Policy initiatives work best when designed to fit with this reality of experience, rather than being introduced on top of it.\u00a0"

            "text": "The team commissioned video ethnography to research parents\u2019 lived experience. As usual, seeing how people act in their homes and hearing their stories was very enlightening. The videos helped place all the research information in a more personal context. They also revealed new, specific details. For example one of the mothers talked about asking to attend (paid-for) antenatal classes before the birth of her second child, which was \u2018not allowed\u2019, but the centre allowed her to in the end after she expressed how anxious she was about it. This showed how some assumptions made in service commissioning that \u2018make sense on paper\u2019, like someone not needing to do the same round of classes twice, do not match up to individuals\u2019 lived experience of important and emotional events.\u00a0"

Graphically representing what we discovered as a map altered people\u2019s focus from looking at existing or new initiatives, to looking at a system and how well it was functioning overall. Our map recorded all the initiatives and policies, organising them according to lenses that reflected relevant systemic challenges, such as the \u2018channel\u2019 by which the service is delivered.\u00a0"

Overall the system has evolved from the accumulation of disparate initiatives, rather than being designed to work as a collective to support each family on their journey.\u00a0"

In the case of marketplaces, like for nurseries and classes, having choice is desirable.

The service landscape approach that we researched and presented was used to inform the Leadsom review into \u2018the first 1,001 days\u2019 conducted from within Department for Health and Social Care, which was published in March 2021."
