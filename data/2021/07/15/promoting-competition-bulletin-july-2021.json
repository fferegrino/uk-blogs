This has been recognised externally with the Global Competition Review\u2019s \u2018Government Agency of the Year\u2019 award. I have set out some of the highlights below."

Withdrawing supply would have meant that thousands of patients would have been forced to switch to an alternative, more expensive treatment, which is also owned by Essential Pharma, and caused disruption for patients, while placing an even greater financial strain on the NHS at a time of unprecedented pressure."

It helps ensure that people get a greater choice of better products and services at lower prices. It rewards those businesses which invest in the development of new and improved products to meet people\u2019s needs. It spurs businesses to seek more cost-effective ways of making and selling those products, so boosting productivity.
