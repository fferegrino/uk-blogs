The new Plant Health Export Service (PHES) will replace the existing export process on eDomero. PHES is designed to make the process of exporting plants and plant products simple and intuitive."

            "text": "You may ask why we\u2019re introducing a new system at all? We have one that works\u2026We do, but the current technology is old, in fact, decades old. It is built on outdated and soon to be unsupported technology. As the number of exporters is predicted to increase substantially over the coming years following EU exit, there was a risk to the stability and therefore the user experience of the service."

            "text": "In addition to these more technical challenges, we want to provide a better experience for our users both in the export trade and internally to our APHA colleagues. The new service brings us up to date and in line with Government Digital Service (GDS) standards, used to help government create and run good digital services that are reliable, simple to use and based on what users need and want."

The inspectorate who carry out this work are known for innovative thought and whilst designing the new processes have brought in efficiency savings to the workforce and industry alike. These have had to be approved at ministerial level and are in place to cope with the uplift in trade when regulations alter."

This enables us to carry out more of our functions within one system. It also allows our workforce to better organise and more easily carry out their work, to manage inspections and charging, record time and more easily coordinate work tasks between teams. Making us a more modern, efficient, and effective public service."

We\u2019ve released about half of the commodity journeys (used agricultural farm machinery, plants, plant products and plant produce) to trade through a \u2018private beta\u2019. This means we\u2019re continuing to undertake user research, gathering feedback, and gaining insights as a result of the service being used \u2018in real-life\u2019. We continue to make changes and improvements while we build, giving us the flexibility to react to rising priorities and urgent or changing needs, and ultimately deliver a fit for purpose product."
