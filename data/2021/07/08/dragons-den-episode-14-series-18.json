That\u2019s why I was pleased when Siobhan Miller stepped into the Den, promising serenity, albeit for pre- and post-natal parents. Siobhan was seeking \u00a3136,000 in return for a 1% equity stake in her business, The Positive Birth Company. Despite not being a birthing partner myself, or planning to be any time soon, I\u2019ll currently take positivity wherever I can get it\u2026"

Apple revealed that from July 2008 to June 2016, 130 billion apps were downloaded from their App store. It is therefore vital that developers protect their intellectual property (IP)."

Tej and Touker threw a spanner in the works by both offering all of the money but for a 10% stake. After much deliberation, the positive-birthing guru was able to avoid a tantrum in the Den by negotiating both Tej\u2019s and Touker\u2019s offers down to 7%, with a drop down to 3% each within 18 months when a full return had been made."

Hoping to disrupt the historically monopolized chewing gum market, Keir sought \u00a350,000 in return for 10% of his business. Honestly, it was staggering to learn that every piece of regular chewing gum contains the same amount of plastic as a plastic straw! To make me feel even more remorseful about my past chewing gum habits, Keir pointed out that the plastic base used in chewing gum is the same material used for shampoo bottles, plastic bags and even car tyres, costing the UK tens of millions of pounds a year to clean up."

Gary Giles and Allan Watts claim that their company, OGEL, is \u2018potentially revolutionary for the building industry\u2019 which takes waste and turns it into building blocks for small at-home offices. The duo sought \u00a350,000 for a 5% stake in their eco company, which promises to convert big ideas to big bucks."

I was very pleased that the duo\u2019s invention was indeed patented, with three small objections with the European Patent Office. It is advisable to seek guidance from a patent attorney when applying for a patent. Visit our website for more information on defending your invention. After viewing the pair\u2019s patent application document, Sara Davies felt reassured that the invention and its IP was in a solid state and seeing the patent gave her the confidence that the pair have the foundation for a successful business."

Tej subsequently added bricks to the mortar by offering all the money on the same terms as Sara, admitting that himself and Sara have skill-sets in different areas but both have the same consumer focus. The offer clearly impressed the entrepreneurs and they walked away with a deal from both Tej and Sara. It just goes to show that protecting your IP can have an instrumental effect on the success of a business."

The pair was seeking \u00a350,000 for a 10% stake in the company. After a very nervous start, the Dragons began to press the duo on their finances. Cracks quickly began to show in the pair\u2019s finances as they couldn\u2019t recall their gross profit figures, leading all but one Dragon to declare themselves out, with the future of the pitch resting firmly on Sara Davies\u2019 finger. Sara was under no illusion as to the amount of work required to help the business back on to its feet, but decided to make an offer nonetheless. Sara offered the full \u00a350,000 but sought a 45% equity stake, dwarfing original offer of 10%, stating \u201cI am going to have to run this business for you.\u201d 45% would give Sara a majority share but time was running out for the pair. After a quick chat at the famous brick wall, the pair accepted Sara\u2019s offer. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Sara manages to help turn this company a business gem."
