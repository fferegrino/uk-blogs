The first element was desk research which identified existing evidence and academic research that already existed about policymaking. This evidence was then analysed in the context of the questions that our discovery was trying to answer. The second element was primary user research which included interviews with policymakers and a cross-government journey mapping strategy. In this blog post we\u2019re going to talk about mapping and what it revealed"

Our intention was to describe, discuss and map the current policymaking process and the stages policymakers work through. Starting from the trigger for a policy review or change, we wanted to find out what the key activities, enablers and obstacles along that journey were."

So our hypothesis was that policymaking is very different in each department.\u00a0"

            "text": "Most participants pointed out that the policymaking journey is not linear, nor is it cyclic. It\u2019s like snakes and ladders, with numerous barriers at the top of each ladder. The start of the journey is similar across departments, it varies in the middle and at the end seems to lack clear activities. The journey map was \u201cactivity heavy\u201d towards the left hand side."

            "text": "There is something about the left to right nature of what policymakers do. They all go through a series of common stages but the order or level of engagement with each stage could be very different. Everything - taken together - is a journey, but we surmised that it is inaccurate to shoe-horn policymakers\u2019 work into\u00a0 a linear process.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "The policymaking journey is not always linear and can iterate back and forward through various stages, but by mapping something in this way it enabled our workshop participants to focus on the content rather than the layout. By content, we mean things like the activities policymakers perform at each stage and the tools they use to perform those activities. By designing the layout like this we provided them space to focus on their own process without losing control of the data we were collecting. As designers, it allowed us to easily see opportunities, gaps and pain points, and associate those with particular stages of the journey.\u00a0"

Although it didn\u2019t always feel complete or definite, and we didn\u2019t always get complete consensus, we did gain enough confidence in the high-level structure before trying to map at scale."

We held post-workshop \u201cretros\u201d or retrospective meeting with each of these departments to further iterate the toolkit.\u00a0"

            "text": "Finally we reflected on the groups of policymakers who attended the mapping sessions. Where they might not have either known each other or had a shared way of working, would they have felt safe talking about \u201ctheir\u201d process. Although we worked with people from the same department, we could have done more to ensure the space was psychologically safe."
