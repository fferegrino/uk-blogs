            "text": "Four years ago, the Essex DES service conducted a health equity audit (HEA) that identified inequalities in both screening uptake and exclusions. These inequalities were experienced between different areas, for people with a learning disability, younger people, women and some ethnic groups."
        },
        {
            "text": "We decided that making a video focused on diabetic eye screening would be a good way to address some of the inequalities and would align with our Essex screening and immunisation strategy to reduce inequalities."
        },
        {
            "text": "Essex DES engagement manager Lorraine Lockwood and I worked with a film company to develop the concept for the film, which features Essex landmarks alongside accounts of real patient experiences and a virtual walkthrough of diabetic eye screening."
        },
        {
            "text": "The video, funded by NHS England and Improvement, includes information about making reasonable adjustments to ensure services are accessible to all. It covers a range of inequality issues and patient experiences from different ages and ethnicities against a backdrop of a variety of Essex locations to capture different audience interests."
        },
        {
            "text": "We are showing the film in areas of low uptake and on a variety of social media platforms to try to reach underserved groups, including a short Facebook campaign. We have shared it with clinical commissioning groups, acute trusts, Diabetes UK, GP practices and local authorities in Essex, universities, colleges, community groups and some large employers."
