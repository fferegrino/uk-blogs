It saved them weeks of development and enabled them to launch on time. More than a dozen services have been launched with the help of Form Builder, including Complain about a court or tribunal and Check how to get repairs done in your rented home. They all benefited from being able to quickly design, test, build and publish forms to government standards - as well as free hosting and ongoing support."

We are working now on adding branching and logic, which enables you to route end users around questions depending on previous answers. Longer term, we are looking at API integration, which enables you to collect user data directly into an application or system. We are also considering how to integrate forms with GOV.UK Pay and Notify and enable end users to save their progress and return later.\u00a0"
