In England, February 2020 was our wettest ever and the fifth wettest winter on record, and internationally, the record breaking heat waves and wild fires experienced in North America could become a more regular occurrence."

Climate scientists predict that sea level in the UK could rise by over a metre by the end of the century. It is therefore essential we get ready for the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The Climate Change Committee has advised that \u201cnet zero is not enough\u201d and that \u201cthe gap between the level of climate risk we face and the level of adaptation underway has widened\u201d."

In July 2020 we updated our climate change allowances for sea level rise and we have now updated our allowances for peak river flows. We now have much more detail than ever before on how river flows will change at a catchment level, allowing us to address future flood and coastal risks more confidently."

It is internationally recognised as a leading example of a climate adaptation strategy, which enables practitioners and policy makers to plan, monitor and review how to adapt to flood risk to the end of the century and beyond."

It is vital that all new development is safe throughout its lifetime and built to be flood resilient in a changing climate. We also need to maximise opportunities for working with partners to create better places for people and wildlife. This includes opportunities for greater use of sustainable drainage systems and natural flood management that can help to slow the flow or store floodwaters during heavy rainfall, which also have wider sustainability and carbon reduction benefits."
