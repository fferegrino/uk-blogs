We have made it crystal clear to water companies that they must significantly reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows as a priority. We have every confidence that the provisions in this Bill will absolutely deliver progressive reductions in the harm caused by storm overflows and any suggestion to the contrary is both disingenuous and untrue."

We will hold underperforming companies to account, including through the measures in the Environment Bill."

This publication \u2013 known as the Strategic Policy Statement - strongly influences investment decisions and is one of Government\u2019s key tools in driving action from water companies."

So far in 2021 the EA has concluded five further prosecutions against water companies with fines of \u00a390 million, \u00a34 million, \u00a32.3 million, \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3540,000 bringing the total since 2015 to 47 prosecutions securing fines of over \u00a3132 million. We have accepted an additional 7 enforcement undertaking offers so far in 2021, paying \u00a31,268,272 to environmental and wildlife trusts organisations bringing the total since 2015 to \u00a311.6 million from 66 enforcement undertakings."

            "text": "The Duke of Wellington\u2019s amendment, whilst well-intentioned, is already delivered through the many measures within the Environment Bill and more broadly. We also must be pragmatic in relation to the calls for complete elimination of storm overflows. The age of our Victorian\u00a0 sewerage systems means that the complete elimination of discharges from storm overflows would be extremely challenging. Initial assessments suggest total elimination would cost more than \u00a3150 billion. This process would involve the complete separation of the sewerage systems, leading to potentially significant disruption for homes, businesses and infrastructure across the country. With such amounts, customer bill increases and trade-offs against other water industry priorities would be unavoidable which is why we will be publishing a report looking specifically at these trade-offs."

We must collectively address all of these if we are to achieve our objectives of returning our waters to a near-natural state. The Government is determined to ensure action is taken on all of these issues, which includes our action on storm overflows."
