Teaching Vacancies was an obvious choice for us in taking a new approach to teacher recruitment, it's the official service for finding and listing teaching jobs provided by the DfE and is free of charge."

Whilst the Trust has worked to keep recruitment advertising costs to a minimum, they have been increasing. Some large Multi Academy Trusts spend upwards of \u00a3500,000. Therefore, we were drawn to Teaching Vacancies\u2019 zero cost offer and freedom to advertise as many times as we need."

            "text": "The money saved using the free listings service has been redirected into improving student outcomes. The use of Teaching Vacancies is encouraged for all of our schools, and, because of our Trust\u2019s size, we are one of the highest users of the service in the West Yorkshire area. Our hope is that by swapping to Teaching Vacancies we can remove the cost of recruitment advertising completely."

When listing a teaching job, you can upload supporting documents like application forms, job descriptions or video links. This gives potential applicants a taster of the school environment. As listing a job is a standardised process, you don\u2019t have to spend time typing the same information across different websites or tailoring your advert to suit the format of a recruitment website."
