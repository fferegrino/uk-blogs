Moreover, the Act itself set out how co-production \u2013 a major tenet of the enterprise we are now embarking on - should be used in the delivery of better care."

We discussed how people pay for their care and contemplated what a reformed adult social care system should look and feel like for working age disabled adults.\u00a0Their care needs are quite different to those of older people and a measure of the reforms\u2019 success will be the ability to support this often forgotten group."

But we have real momentum and we will do all we can to engage broadly, because their views are vital. If we are to get this right, their experiences, needs and aspirations must influence the process of reform for the better."

            "text": "There remain persistent challenges of perception. Even people who need care, provide informal care or already receive it, don\u2019t necessarily identify with being social care users. This is especially the case for people who do not live in care homes or supported living settings.\u00a0 People talk about going to \u2018clubs\u2019 not \u2018receiving day services\u2019, they have \u2018someone who comes round to help\u2019 not \u2018dom care\u2019. Some might even go on \u2018holiday\u2019, while their families get some \u2018respite\u2019 from their caring responsibilities."

            "text": "It is really important we gather the broadest range of insights and views. It becomes even harder when tackling issues about access to care, especially in communities where care is delivered by families and the idea of accepting help from outsiders is alien. Striking the right balance between getting it done and getting it right will be very difficult, but there is a collective will to do our best."

We all agree the system needs to change, that fairness must be prioritised, and that we should do all we can to prevent vulnerable people slipping through the net.\u00a0We all agree resourcing is a central issue. We all agree care workers deserve decent pay and unpaid carers enhanced support. We also agree care needs to be tailored to individuals."

            "text": "Whilst some of the problems we are experiencing are created by a dysfunctional market (supermarkets can put up prices so they can pay hauliers more \u2013 care providers can\u2019t do that in order to attract and retain its key workers), it is worth tapping into marketing expertise to model the customer experience."

In the same way reading this blog may lead you to search more articles about social care, wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if the system was truly responsive to people\u2019s needs without them even having to ask?"
