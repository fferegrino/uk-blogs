Between 18 and 22 October, HMRC along with organisations across the UK will be running events to raise awareness around digital inclusion and will help people all over the country find the support they need to improve their digital skills. This time of the year provides us with an opportunity to raise the profile of digital inclusion in our professions and examine what we can do as government departments - and individuals - to help more people get online."

            "text": "Digital inclusion is about helping and enabling everyone to get online and empowering them to join in activities online in a meaningful and productive way. Many of us have used digital tools to help stay in touch with friends and family, or access entertainment in new and different ways in the past year. They have helped us at times when face to face contact wasn\u2019t possible. We\u2019ve used digital skills and services for essential tasks too. Perhaps to shop online, book medical services, or work from our homes. Imagine how different life would have been without access to digital services, skills, or tools. That\u2019s the experience for more than 2.6 million people who are still offline in the UK and/or find themselves digitally excluded."

We want to enable all of our customers to engage digitally with confidence and feel at ease. Get Online Week will help us do this. We will run a varied programme of online sessions between 18 and 22 October, which is tailored to a cross government audience. By sharing data and insights, we aim to enhance knowledge, identify opportunities, and encourage everyone to consider digital inclusion in the work that they do. High-profile organisations such as Lloyds Bank, The Good Things Foundation, and the Office of National Statistics will also be joining us, so ensure you sign up early to avoid disappointment."
