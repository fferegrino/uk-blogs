The aim of the day was to highlight the legal responsibilities of all involved in the waste exports market to establish a collaboration between them and us."

This gave us our best opportunity to help them understand the issues and how together we can prevent these. Through simple checks before waste leaves our shores, costly repatriations can be prevented. This message was echoed throughout the day from our Illegal Waste Exports team and external partners, including The European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) and The International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL)."

This really emphasised to everyone where the common trends are in illegal waste exports, from paperwork administrative offences to contaminated waste loads. Delegates couldn\u2019t ignore the clear evidence uncovered by the SWEAP project that shows where we all need to focus our attention!"

Their 30 Days at Sea Projects have already achieved results, including the first ever South African conviction for maritime pollution and 1318 arrests for numerous waste crime pollution offenses. For me this really showed the scale of the problem we all face and how it will take all of us to stop these crimes and bring offenders to justice."

            "text": "Bringing the focus to plastic waste exports from the UK, Carl, one of our Technical and Port Officers shared a case study from his own personal experience of tackling this problem, presenting information on trends and risks. The case study highlighted a recovery facility entered onto exports documentation. By doing a small amount of research he discovered that the destination address for the waste plastic was in fact a hairdressers! Amusing but, the message was strong and clear - criminals will enter false information onto an Annex VII in an attempt to mislead us or hoping we will not check. Industries as well as us can and should carry out these checks. This is a really quick, effective way to reduce opportunities for criminals to break the rules. To bring home the importance of doing these checks, Carl played a BBC video that showed plastic being dumped and burned in the deserts of Turkey. This had a powerful impact on everyone watching, showing how important it is that we work together to protect and preserve both environment and human health."

In my role as an Intelligence Research Officer, I presented delegates with the ugly truth about the volume of scrap tyres illegally exported to India and Pakistan. I shared how intelligence we received led us to discover that a facility who are only allowed to export two containers per week, were actually exporting 30 containers per week. Hearing this shocked numerous attendees. I explained the vital role those present have in reducing the chances of a costly repatriation or quay fees by implementing simple checks into their booking process. They would soon know if that booking is legal or not."

This soon had attendees realising collaboration with the Environment Agency would be beneficial to their company."

Post conference we\u2019ve heard from shipping lines and freight forwarders telling us they are looking at implementing the checks into their booking procedures and are truly on board with collaborating with us. This is an absolute joy for me and my colleagues confirming that what we started at this conference, with those partners and companies, is already making a difference"
