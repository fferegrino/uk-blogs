            "text": "I have to admit, the term \u2018Business Analyst\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound particularly interesting. It\u2019s not even very descriptive; my own parents don\u2019t really understand what I do. Analyse the business, perhaps? Look at processes, write business cases, monitor value-add with KPIs and perform cost:benefit analysis maybe?"

            "text": "That\u2019s all true, but there\u2019s much more to it than that. We\u2019re an often innocuous-looking part of the engine that runs in the machine of a digital development team, that ensures the service delivered meets the needs of the business. That it does the right things, in the right way, and perhaps more importantly doesn\u2019t do or permit anything it shouldn\u2019t. You dig into business processes and activities and ask why, when, what, who, where, how?"

It can be a solitary activity, as you\u2019re often working ahead of your team to make sure that when the questions come, you\u2019ve got the answers and that if you haven\u2019t, you know where to go to get them. You speak to stakeholders, you ask questions, you model out processes and concepts and you do an awful lot of soaking up of knowledge. You take the happy day process and you flip it upside down, and look at it again - if all doesn\u2019t go to plan, then what happens? What changes? What downstream impact is there? What are all the possible variances of this process, and how would they affect the onward flow?"

            "text": "Your aim is to become a proxy for the business, within the team. To be able to advise on the business processes, and the business rules (what must, or must not happen or be true at various points in a business process) and ensure that the resulting service is fit for purpose and working in line with the business needs, and objectives. That should one of those \u2018untoward\u2019 scenarios happen in real life, it\u2019s handled gracefully, or to be confident enough that the risk of one of those scenarios cropping up is minimal enough that it doesn't need to be handled explicitly - at least not now. Agile development and delivery is all about prioritisation (more on that in the next blog)."

What the job description doesn\u2019t say is \u201cAbility to take in vast amounts of information and domain knowledge in a short space of time whilst building strong relationships\u201d, \u201cTranslate abstract concepts and the contents of copious amounts of documentation into easily understandable models\u201d, and \u201cUse all of that, plus all the stuff still stuck in your head to identify the business needs, and document them in a format that your team can work to deliver\u201d but ultimately that\u2019s what the role entails."

They don\u2019t take \u2018that\u2019s just how it is\u2019 for an answer and were almost certainly \u201cWhy?\u201d children, with an innate and lifelong love for learning.\u00a0"
