Even more so, after my second loss in December 2020. After both losses, it was too incomprehensible to imagine a time moving forward without pain. But the more I reflected, I started to think about what actually\u00a0 helped pull me through this first year. These are a few of my thoughts.\u00a0"

With that, I am pretty sure I muddled\u00a0 through all the stages of grief and then back again. Ultimately, what really helped was realising and accepting that my grief would always remain part of me.\u00a0"

I now know\u00a0 I can think about it, talk about it, cry about it at any point in my life when I need to - and that\u2019s ok.\u00a0"

The year she should have started school, we donated books to the school library in her name. Each year on her birthday, we read stories by candlelight in her memory with our two living children.\u00a0\u00a0"

These are not sad trips, but special shared family moments. We smile, we laugh, we play. The visits usually encourage questions from the children that maybe haven\u2019t occurred to them before, and seem to help them feel comfortable talking about their feelings about the older sister they never got to meet."

But once it gets to her birthday, that\u2019s usually a happy day, with amazing memories of holding my first born baby girl. I remind myself each year to be gentle on myself and to take time out if I\u2019m having a wobble. On her birthday, I allow myself to wallow in my memories - it\u2019s not for everyone - but allowing myself that time works for me."
