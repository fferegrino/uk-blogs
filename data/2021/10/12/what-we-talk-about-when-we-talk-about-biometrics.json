            "text": "There can be no doubt that technology using biometric data is progressing at a rapid pace. Clearly, the use of such technologies can be intrusive to privacy and raises other human rights considerations. However, it can also provide significant opportunities for law enforcement agencies to improve the prevention and investigation of serious crime and the prosecution of some very dangerous individuals, helping safeguard other fundamental rights such as the right to life and freedom from degrading treatment. Finding the right balance between the privacy concerns and entitlements of the individual while harnessing new technology responsibly, accountably and proportionately is proving to be a significant challenge for policing today; tomorrow\u2019s technology will make it even more so.\u00a0 Which is why there needs to be an informed and realistic response to the government\u2019s idea of soaking up the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner functions within a data regulator\u2019s role which is buried at the end of the DCMS\u2019 ongoing broad consultation called Data: A new direction."

The anticipated impact of absorption does not make it into the accompanying Analysis of Expected Impact document even under the section on \u2018delivering better public services\u2019 or \u2018impacts on privacy and trust\u2019."

NSDs are made by chief police officers and empower the police to keep an individual\u2019s biometrics for up to 5 years in the first instance; thereafter they can be renewed for as many times as deemed necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore an NSD represents a substantial and enduring interference with an individual\u2019s rights, particularly as the subject of the NSD is not informed of its existence and has no opportunity to make representations against it.\u202f\u202fIf the Commissioner is not satisfied that an NSD has been properly made, or concludes that the continued retention of the biometric data is not necessary and proportionate, they have the statutory power to order destruction of the biometrics."

The suspect is told of the application and has the legal right to make representations to the OBC."

Over the past 6 months I have made many such directions. I was also required to provide an assessment of whether temporary measures suspending legal protections on police use of biometrics during the COVID 19 pandemic had been used only as intended and also whether any biometric material had been lost."

This is what Scotland went on to do and this is what everyone talks about when they talk about better regulation of police biometrics, yet neither the questions nor the consultation make reference to this clear recommendation."
