For those of you that don\u2019t know me, I started my career as a driving instructor before joining DVSA to specialise in the Agency\u2019s ADI-related work. Like you I am passionate about improving road safety."

So, when an ADI presents a candidate for a driving test, whatever the journey they have been on to reach the point of being test ready, they are, in an ADI\u2019s professional opinion, ready and safe to drive independently. Whilst we don't expect an ADI to have 100% pass rate (we all know nerves can play a part on the day) there is a pattern to the standards presented by higher performing ADIs and those that regularly present a lower standard."
