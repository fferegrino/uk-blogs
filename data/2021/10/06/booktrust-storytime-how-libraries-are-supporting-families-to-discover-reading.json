Yet it is children from disadvantaged backgrounds who face the biggest barriers to developing a regular habit of reading. We want to learn more about how we can best support disadvantaged families to make visiting a library a regular and lasting part of family life. Understanding\u00a0 how we can best support families is crucial and could make an important contribution to levelling up inequalities in society."
