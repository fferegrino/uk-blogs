Dawn told us: \u201cI was aware of frameworks but not sure how to use them. I was concerned that if I started down that road, I would be committed to use it, however, I did not realise I could use them as a benchmark to compare\u201d. Following the Summer Expo, Dawn approached CPC regarding the DfE approved Staff Absence framework and was able to achieve a saving of \u00a3600 compared to the standard price as a continuing customer."

Such webinars have really helped me understand and breakdown each Framework, so I know first-hand how useful they are. If any School Business Professionals, finance managers or Headteachers are curious about a Framework, I cannot recommend these sessions enough."
