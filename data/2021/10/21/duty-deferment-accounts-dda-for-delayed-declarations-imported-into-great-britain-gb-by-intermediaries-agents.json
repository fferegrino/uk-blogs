            "text": "Duty Deferment is the main payment method for customs and excise duty. It can also be used to pay import VAT. Having a duty deferment account lets you defer payments for customs duty, excise duty and import VAT. It also lets you make monthly payments to HMRC through Direct Debit, instead of paying for individual consignments immediately at import, or when released from a duty suspensive procedure such as customs warehousing or excise warehousing. If payments are above \u00a320million this will need to be paid by CHAPS."

Your clients will have 175 days to attain a DDA and submit a full declaration from the day the goods arrive in GB (See \u201cWhat do I need to apply for a DDA\u201d below)."

It is important that you apply for a DDA as soon as possible because you will not be able to submit your client\u2019s supplementary declaration unless you have an HMRC approved DDA. You can then choose to use your DDA on behalf of your clients or encourage them to apply for their own DDA (see \u2018Using your client\u2019s DDA\u2019 below). If they already have their own DDA you as an agent can be authorised to use their DDA."

You must apply for your DDA and Simplified Customs Declarations Processes authorisation in good time to meet the 175-day deadline for supplementary declarations."
