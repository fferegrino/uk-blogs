I started in the depths of the pandemic, and I remember fondly imagining that the sense of uncertainty was temporary \u2013 COVID-19 would retreat, I would get my feet under the table, and things would get \u2018back to normal.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Of course, the lesson of the recent past has been that change, ambiguity and unpredictability are part of life, and certainly part of leadership. In the last few months in BEIS, we have been dealing with an unexpected and dramatic spike in global gas prices, fuel queues at the pumps and a shortage of CO2, not to mention the slings and arrows that come your way when you\u2019re about to set out the country\u2019s plan to meet its long-term climate ambitions. The truth is that there never were \u2018normal times\u2019, and there probably never will be."

Short-term challenge can be exciting (especially if, like me, you actually quite enjoy being a little bit adrenaline-fuelled), but when we face ongoing challenge and unpredictability, it can become wearing and stressful. So, for me, much of the last year has been spent thinking about how we hold each other strong in times of change, and bring out the positives and the growth.\u00a0"

            "text": "I think one of the real upsides of the pandemic has been that we have all found new ways of communicating with our teams, involving less use of enormous conference rooms and their slightly malfunctioning microphones. Neither of these really lend themselves to honest and transparent sharing of information - or indeed emotion, which can be just as important to share."

When things are stable you can, if you really want to, probably get away with an autocratic style of leadership: set the goal, hand out the plan, ensure tasks are fulfilled. But I think that\u2019s now long gone as a smart way to lead in A Modern Civil Service."

Trusting our teams and developing our people so they can navigate the inevitably choppy waters has to be at the heart of our role as leaders. I feel incredibly lucky at BEIS: I\u2019m surrounded by a brilliant and collaborative team in whom I have an enormous amount of faith \u2013 and I know I couldn\u2019t do my job without that."

One of the challenges of leading in interesting times is that you don\u2019t always know what you are doing - nobody does. Mistakes happen, especially when you are having to act fast, and you don\u2019t have time to look at all the angles. We inevitably rely more on heuristics and judgement \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem if our teams are all the same. We need diversity of perspectives and backgrounds to be in the room (virtual or physical) when decisions are made; and that becomes more important, not less, when we are operating under stress or at pace."
