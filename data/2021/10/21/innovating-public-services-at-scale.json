One former teacher described it as \u2018like being on a beach, being hit by a big wave and before you can get up to take a breath, another big wave hits\u2019.

Equally, information submitted as part of the candidate registration process was regularly duplicated elsewhere in the journey, creating additional administrative burdens.

Looking back, we really knew this innovative way of working was working when DfE teams began to restructure themselves to reflect the teacher service lines. They let go of the idea that 'policy' and 'delivery' are separate things, and created multidisciplinary teams with singular ownership of each problem and service: from concept, to implementation, to continuous improvement. This allowed the policy and delivery to iterate and evolve as the teams learnt more about the people that use their services and how the system worked for them.\u00a0"

Its \u2018let a thousand flowers bloom\u2019 model had produced a lot of failed public services, and in an already highly pressurised environment, this contributed to teachers feeling overwhelmed and undervalued.\u00a0 By taking a systems-thinking approach and bringing policy and delivery into single teams, DfE was able to see challenges from the perspective of service users and develop a systems map as a framework for future policy design innovation. Considering each innovation in the context of how it relates to other parts of the system allows innovations to become more than the sum of their parts."
