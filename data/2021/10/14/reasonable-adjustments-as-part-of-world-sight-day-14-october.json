The term \u2018reasonable\u2019 is subjective in itself as what is reasonable to me may not be to someone else, so who determines what is \u2018reasonable\u2019?"

I have a vision impairment and use assistive software, ZoomText, to magnify and read the screen contents.\u00a0 As a software developer, the environments I use are resource heavy, requiring high power CPU and memory. Unfortunately, so does ZoomText, the software that essential to help me do my job. COVID-19 occurred, and we had to work from home, however there was no way I could run ZoomText and my development applications on a laptop. I started the process of requesting a more powerful laptop as a Reasonable Adjustment. I had no idea what I was in for but was fortunate to have the support of my manager along with that of the wider team, which I am really grateful for."

            "text": "I was told that to put together a business case to enable IT to purchase a suitable laptop. I was offered another laptop that did not meet the specification I required. I wanted to show that I was open to try different laptops and I hoped this one would be adequate."

Imagine typing an email and the letter appearing 1 to 3 seconds after you had typed them, this was the level of performance I was having to contend with.\u00a0 If I shut down ZoomText it would behave normally, so I know the assistive software was the cause, but without it, I\u2019m unable to use the computer."

            "text": "The problem was, we have no centralised system for handling reasonable adjustment requests and funding, no one knew what to do, who would pay for what, who had the authority to purchase the equipment.\u00a0 The whole system was not connected. It\u2019s left up to the individual to sort out the issue, liaising between departments, which put the requester under great stress."

It\u2019s a system / policy failure, which I want to highlight so please take a look at your processes for handling Reasonable Adjustments, do all your managers know what to do?\u00a0 Do you have a central budget? Do managers have the authority to buy equipment. Is all the emphasis on the disabled individual to arrange everything?\u00a0 We know what we need but do we really need to be involved in the purchase, installation and management of said equipment?"

The last 18 months have been difficult for all of us on so many levels but one thing that many people have been grateful for is the ability to work effectively from home. Leona\u2019s story illustrates all to clearly the impact of having that productive working environment taken away from you which would be difficult enough without having to deal with working through an unsupportive and ill-defined system. This situation could so easily have provided a positive outcome. Leona\u2019s needs were clearly understood and had previously been accommodated and this just needed to be translated to the new IT hardware in a time course measured in weeks rather than months! This is sadly a situation all too often faced by disabled staff and we all need to work harder to create systems and procedures that are people focused that enable staff and are flexible enough to cope with a diversity of needs.
