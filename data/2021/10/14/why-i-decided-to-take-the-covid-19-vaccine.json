I cannot express how hard it is to see people dying in front of your eyes whom you have looked after for many years. I cried nearly every day at home and at work. I had to do it so that no one could see it because I have to be strong and be a role model for my colleagues. COVID-19 changed our lives."

At first I didn't trust a vaccine made so quickly could protect us from a virus science knew little about. But I changed my mind when when I myself contracted COVID-19 and saw so many residents become infected too. And now I want to say thank you to the scientists for being able to make an effective vaccine in such a short time."
