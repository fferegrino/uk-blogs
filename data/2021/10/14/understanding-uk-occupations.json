The SOC extension project was formed to address this need by developing an additional layer of detail which has been termed a \u2018Sub Unit\u202fGroup\u2019 level comprised of six-digits."

The economic impact of COVID 19, which has resulted in a significant shift in the demand and availability of specific roles, as well as long term issues such as Brexit and automation, make the extension more relevant than ever.\u202fGreater detail in the classification of roles can:"

However, as the\u202fproject progressed, the strong demand for more granular SOC statistics became clear. The project is therefore expanding and is addressing the challenges involved in making statistical production at the extended level a reality."

The job titles within the index have now been matched to the framework and are available as an online resource. This enables the look up of any UK job title to the relevant six-digit SOC code."

The development of these descriptions adds further clarification to the types of occupation included within a given group.

The team are analysing the outputs of this work, but early indications are encouraging. It should be noted that matching tools will not achieve 100% match rate with adequate quality, at the six digit level and the four-digit level; some level of clerical matching will be required. Work is continuing to maximise the automatic match rates of test data and explore the feasibility of clerically matching the remainder. Once complete, the ambition is to produce experimental statistics at the six-digit level."

The team need to improve their understanding about the impact that a widened classification could have on both the automatic and manual coding of data. Additionally, they need to consider issues around maintenance, updates and management of the extended framework and supporting materials."
