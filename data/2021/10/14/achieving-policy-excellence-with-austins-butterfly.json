This process helps Austin to really\u00a0look\u00a0(as a scientist would), rather than creating something from his mind\u2019s eye based on his assumption of what \u2018a butterfly\u2019 looks like (assumptions are really helpful to get started on tackling a problem, but you must prove or disprove them along the way). Taken together,\u00a0this looking and listening enables Austin to learn\u00a0to the extent that he succeeds in completing his task to an extremely high standard."

In sum, being a good policymaker means providing rounded, well researched advice, that enables decision makers to make the best possible decisions grounded in fact, not assumption."

There was a failure in the policy making process. Specifically, the failure to sufficiently consider the potential impact of the hostile (now compliant) environment measures, including \u201can institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation.\u201d Wendy Williams said: \u201cUltimately, the department failed to look, engage, listen and learn, across all stages of making and implementing the elements of immigration policy covered in this report.\u201d"

Six months later the Home Office published its Comprehensive Improvement Plan, setting out how it intends to implement Williams\u2019 recommendations, including righting the wrongs of the scandal and a focus on \u2018wholesale and lasting cultural change\u2019. Wendy Williams began her revisit of the Department at the end of September and aims to publish her assessment of progress by the end of March 2022."

It also reminds me of the OECD\u2019s framework for public sector innovation, which emphasises the need for government to provide the right environment for public sector organisations to encourage and enable innovation."

Policymakers must also have the tools and environments they need to look, listen and learn, and innovate (e.g. better commissioning, access to better information and evidence, more collaborative ways of working, permission and skills to engage widely, including with critics)."
