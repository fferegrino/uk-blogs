More alarmingly, they are significantly less likely to complete their degree; in 2018, 72% of White students studying geography completed their course compared to just 57% of Black students."

In its first year, Esri UK will be supporting an undergraduate student with \u00a330,000 over the duration of their course and a postgraduate student with \u00a320,000. Esri UK will add at least one undergraduate and postgraduate student each year for the next five years. In addition, the scholars will also receive support and training throughout their time in the programme from Esri UK and Black Geographers."
