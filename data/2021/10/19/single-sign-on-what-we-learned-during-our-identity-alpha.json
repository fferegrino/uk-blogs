Millions of people in the UK don\u2019t have a passport or driving licence and there\u2019s no magic document that lets everyone prove their identity. To include everyone in identity checking we will need to accept a broad range of documents and evidence types: there\u2019s no silver bullet. And although we often talk about \u2018digital identity\u2019, it\u2019s clear that we will need to go beyond online channels to include everyone."

And so might a young, highly educated, urban renter who does everything online but who has never needed a driving licence, moves address frequently, isn\u2019t named on any bills, and is short on time."

            "text": "Mobile apps are a helpful tool in identity checking because they allow users to do things that can\u2019t easily be done in a browser. For example, someone with a document containing a near-field communication chip (like a UK passport or a biometric residence permit) can scan that document using a smartphone to open the chip and read the contents. This is a high value check that provides assurance about the validity of the document which can then remove the need for additional checks that would take longer and might require the same user to share extra personal information."

            "text": "Not everyone will want to use an app or even be able to, and that\u2019s OK. But if a mobile app can be cost-effective, secure, and help us meet the needs of some users better than we\u2019d ever be able to without one, we should offer them one."

For a rough indication of scale, let\u2019s say there are 4 strength levels, 10 accepted documents which can each be checked in 2 ways, across 3 channels. That\u2019s already 240 unique user journeys. This has been a helpful framework not only to understand journeys, but also to define our initial scope and help us understand complexity"

One of our main discoveries from usability testing was that a task list-based design pattern works well as a simple, flexible and extensible way of assembling user journeys from different types of checks to fit different demographics."

For example, our first prototype tried to educate users at the start of the journey about the value of having a reusable identity, but it was too abstract and confusing. We knew it was important for users to understand that they\u2019re creating something that can be reused, but the right moment to introduce this idea is when someone has finished proving their identity and has the option to save it. This has tested much better and makes the journey more seamless."
