Many women, and I include myself in this, find the menopause hugely impactful and, at times, a difficult journey. The menopause can bring about symptoms that are, for some, life-changing, making life harder both at home and at work."

When I started to open up about my own difficulties, I realised that I wasn\u2019t the only one and this was also happening to some of my closest colleagues \u2013 we just weren\u2019t acknowledging it to each other. I felt able to own the moments when my brain freezes and no sensible words come out or when physical symptoms can\u2019t help but be noticed by others. I fully support the work of the Cross-Government Menopause Network in their ambition to encourage the whole Civil Service to become menopause-friendly, a place where we can all have rich and meaningful discussions."
