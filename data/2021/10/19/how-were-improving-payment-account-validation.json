Many of which can be down to basic human error or simply a matter of timing."

Not to be confused with verification - which is attributing a payee to a payment account - validation offers the assurance that a sort code and account number (or building society roll number or credit union account number) are a known valid combination. It also confirms that they belong to an active bank and they are capable of making or receiving the payment that is being set up."

There\u2019s a lot of really good work that\u2019s already been done, but as a part of our goal to transform Payment Services we wanted to see what we could do better. Like all good product journeys, we set out to find out what the problems were with the existing solutions, and if there were opportunities to make things more effective. Here\u2019s what we found\u2026"

            "text": "All systems that deal with incoming or outgoing payments need a method of validating payment account details, known as a modulus check. For most systems, a service provided by a Credit Reference Agency (CRA) is the most reliable way to perform this check. Across DWP we were in a position of holding numerous contracts with CRAs, and a handful of those contracts were with the same supplier. For products and services without a contract the only available option was to rely on manually updated, freely available, data sets. This is not ideal as they can be up to a month out of date, and of course relying on a manual action means that a person needs to be available to fulfil the task."

Management Information (MI) is used in all kinds of ways from understanding the infrastructure needed, to prioritising your backlog, to helping visualise product success all the way to negotiating contracts. We discovered that the MI available wasn\u2019t in easy reach of the product team, but what opportunities were there to change that?"

This tool gives our agents an additional layer of assurance that the account details provided are valid and that a payment is likely to be successful. It\u2019s an invaluable tool for our agents, but like all technology it\u2019s now showing signs of age and isn\u2019t in line with the latest accessibility guidelines, so what could we do to make a payment account validation tool even better?"

            "text": "For payment account validation we needed to start at the beginning: negotiating a single contract with a credit reference agency with the bold ambition of consolidating all existing contracts. The heavy lifting was of course done by our colleagues in the Commercial team but after months of negotiations a new deal was brokered. The new deal gives the department a 16% annual saving when compared to the cost of the 6 individual contracts."

We do this by creating strategic reusable micro-services that can be easily consumed by products and services across the department. This helps increase pace of delivery and reduce duplication of effort. In Digital Payment Services we have developed a strategic payment account validation service called \u2018BankVal\u2019. BankVal is a Rest API and is available through our API Gateway for all products and services to use."
