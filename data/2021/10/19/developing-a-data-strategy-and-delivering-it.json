Good data can help us understand the environment we operate in and the way we operate within it, the needs of the citizens who come to us, and the impact our services have."

We are currently responsible for over 200TB of the stuff, and that amount is growing in both volume and diversity at a rate of around 10% a year. While we use it day to day to do our work, there are challenges in using it to work smarter."

            "text": "Data is collected in different systems at different times for different purposes, which means that it can be inconsistent or duplicated, and it can\u2019t easily be re-used across multiple systems. The information which records where data came from and why, how valid it is, or how old it is, is also different in different systems, which means it is can be difficult to know which is the right piece of data to re-use for the right purpose in other processes or systems. So, when it comes to improving our ability to re-use that data we have our work cut out."

This sets out nine data principles, which we aim to adopt in order to address the challenges we have around using data better, and ensure that in future we are managing data in ways that make it easier to re-use securely, legally and ethically."

So to support this endeavour, the department has also taken the step of establishing a new Chief Data Office (CDO), led by our Chief Data Officer, Paul Lodge. The aim of the CDO is to work across the department enabling, supporting and encouraging efforts to move towards using data more strategically to serve citizens. I was delighted to be asked to lead the establishment of the CDO as Head of Data Strategy and Enablement, and I\u2019ve been working hard to build a great team focused on moving us forward."

If we\u2019re to be successful in delivering the Data Strategy, I believe there are three key things that we, like every forward thinking organisation, must remember in order to guide our approach.\u00a0 \u00a0"

            "text": "First of all, data needs must follow business needs. The work we do in the CDO to support the department to make\u00a0better use of data must be based on what the business needs us to do. Whether that be led by areas of greatest risk or where there is a greatest need to improve data quality and inter-operability, we will prioritise activity based on areas of greatest need."

        {
            "text": "Secondly, we need to recognise that data is all of our business (pun intended). It\u2019s tempting to feel that with the establishment of the CDO all the data challenges of our department will be fixed, and everyone else can go on as normal.\u00a0"

            "text": "We can and will provide data strategy, policy, advice, guidance and monitoring of compliance (alongside the Data Protection Office). However, colleagues who work with data and those who build systems to process that data all have their part to play in applying these to make sure we optimise our use of it in a legal, secure and consistent way."
        },
        {
            "text": "Finally, we have to remember that data describes real people, places and things. Data enthusiasts can wax lyrical about how amazing data is and what value it can bring to the organisation. We can get into lots of technical detail when discussing standards, rules, policies and models.\u00a0However, when we talk about valuing data as an asset, what we really mean is recognising the value of the information we have about citizens, our colleagues, our buildings and our financial and technological resources. We need to value data the same way we value those things."

The data that we manage is in an increasingly complex variety of formats, so it\u2019s important that we handle it accordingly. We already have pockets of excellence in data custodianship and data management across the organisation, but the CDO will look to make sure that all teams across the department who use data take the best of what we know and apply it in a consistent way.\u00a0"
