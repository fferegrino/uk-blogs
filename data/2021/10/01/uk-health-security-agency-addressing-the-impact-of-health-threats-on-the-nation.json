            "text": "Our mission is to save lives by protecting the whole nation from infectious disease and other external health hazards. However, I also see UKHSA's establishment as an opportunity to drive forward the innovations brought to the forefront by the pandemic such as the development of new diagnostic tools and the opportunity to bring testing to your postbox."
