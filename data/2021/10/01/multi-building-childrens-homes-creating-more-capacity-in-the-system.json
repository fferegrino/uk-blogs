            "text": "The care system is under pressure. Places to live for children with the most complex needs are scarce, and often not where they are most needed. And while the recent move to stop using unregulated accommodation for under-16s is welcome in principle, it\u2019s likely to put even more pressure on a system already struggling to cope with demand."

            "text": "The use of unregistered provision \u2013 a symptom of these capacity issues \u2013 is still a huge concern. Of course, we can\u2019t be sure of the quality of unregistered provision, so we don\u2019t know whether children are safe or getting good quality care."
        },
        {
            "text": "Councils often resort to using unregistered placements in emergency situations, when there\u2019s simply nowhere else for a child to go. And a shortage of secure accommodation for the most vulnerable children, at risk to themselves and others, means that the courts have little choice but to authorise the use of unregistered placements. Taken together, this is fuelling a need for children to live in small, sometimes single-bedded, homes, which are often required very quickly. Similarly, if a provider ends a placement with little or no notice, a local authority\u2019s options may be limited."

This is a real step forward \u2013 allowing homes to work more flexibly, creatively, and to provide more options for children."

        {
            "text": "Apart from residential special schools, children\u2019s homes have always had to register each of the buildings where they provide care and accommodation separately. But this means that providing emergency placements, or places for children who can\u2019t easily be placed in group living, is challenging. Providers argue it\u2019s not financially viable to keep homes empty until a local authority needs a placement."

            "text": "The average children\u2019s home can look after three or four children. Our new approach allows for a slightly larger arrangement, bringing more capacity, but keeping numbers within sensible limits to make sure there can still be effective leadership, management, and oversight. We think this strikes the right balance between creating more flexibility and keeping children safe."

Applications will need to meet all current registration requirements, as well as our additional checks."

The inspections are likely to be longer, given the different settings involved. We expect full inspections to start next year. We will accept registration applications from 15 November."

This much-needed extra capacity will go some way to ease the strain on our creaking care system, and, we hope, to help reduce the number of children living in unregistered and potentially unsafe provision."
