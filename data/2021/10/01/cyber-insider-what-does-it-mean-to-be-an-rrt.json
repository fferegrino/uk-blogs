We speak to a couple of them and get an insight into how they train to be ready to deploy at short notice and provide cyber capabilities all over the world."

            "text": "The weapons he was referring to were cyber capabilities. As digital technology continues to advance, we see an even greater battlefield opening up in cyberspace. Keeping us protected against the threats of that battlefield are UK\u2019s cyber specialists, who defend us from an average 60 cyber attacks every day."

            "text": "Among those specialists there are an elite team of military experts, ready to deploy at short notice anywhere in the world. Their job is to respond to any potential cyber attack, eradicate the malicious actor, and secure the systems from further attack. They are the Rapid Reaction Team (RRT)."

        {
            "text": "Being part of an RRT means being ready to deploy at any moment, and training hard to make sure you remain at the cutting edge of cyber threats. Those threats could target any kind of digital system, and new ways to exploit them are found all the time, which means no two attacks are ever quite the same."

            "text": "Maintaining this high level of understanding is extremely challenging and roles within an RRT are only offered to personnel who meet the rigorous standards required. It also means having to train hard to ensure their skills remain sharp, and recently a small number of RRT personnel virtually deployed on an international cyber exercise called Exercise Cyber Flag."

            "text": "The Exercise closely followed a real word scenario where each team\u2019s mission involved protecting vital operational networks from the attacks of an opposing force of cyber experts (known as a red team). The red team\u2019s job was to infiltrate the exercise\u2019s network, and steal sensitive data before deploying \u2018ransomware\u2019. Ransomware is form of malware that locks a user out of their system, before demanding payment in return for granting access again."

This ensures that when an incident does occur we are able effectively respond, securing mission critical data, and ensure vital operational networks remain available to commanders.\u201d"
