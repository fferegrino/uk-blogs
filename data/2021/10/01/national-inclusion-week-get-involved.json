In this blog the Chairs of the working groups will introduce themselves and give you a hint of what our future plans are. As I mentioned in my last post on Wednesday, we are all volunteers and things will only happen if people volunteer. If you would like to get involved please contact the GSE Profession Team and they can link you to the relevant group. If you are just passionate about D&I but aren\u2019t sure what you\u2019d like to do, please also get in touch with the team."

Additionally, we want to celebrate and recognise the amazing work undertaken by government scientists and engineers and help inspire the next generation."

We will also be promoting the use of Disability Passports across the profession, easing movement between posts across government. Regrettably, there is still a stigma associated with disability, especially around mental ill-health and we will be looking to the Heads of Science and Engineering Profession (HoSEPs) to be vocal supporters alongside an active blog programme."
