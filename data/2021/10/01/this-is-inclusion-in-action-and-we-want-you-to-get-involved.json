It has really given me a sense of belonging to society once again and given me my sense of self- worth that had dwindled a little with being out of work for over three years. I am really proud of myself getting this job. In the past I would never of dreamed of applying for such a position. With the help of the working health team and seeing the ins and outs of the role in the past few weeks it has really boosted my confidence and distinguished any fears I had that I would not be able to perform in the role thus making me believe that the transferable skills I am able to bring over to this role will stand me in good stead for the future and what will hopefully be a fruitful career\u201d."

Seeing how things operate in practice is really important to the successful running of Life Chances schemes, as we have to understand who we are trying to reach through our different methods of recruitment, and what barriers they might face.\u00a0Speaking to Prison Service colleagues on a recent visit to a Young Offender Institution, I was shocked to hear that nearly a quarter of the young men being held in custody there had come from care-experienced backgrounds. The prison had been working to adopt an approach based around Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES), and training staff to understand the impact these experiences may have on the people in their care. A significant number of the young men had experienced violence and trauma growing up, and continued to be affected by influences as they grew up such as the gang culture that was prevalent in that area. I was struck by how easy it is to forget that these types of backgrounds and barriers exist, particularly when I have the privilege of a supportive family and friends, and how difficult it must be to get onto the right track when your start to adult life is affected by what has gone before.\u00a0 But it also brought home to me how important our collective work is - 'The first step is in recognising that not everyone has the same opportunities, and the life chances that we create might be the turning point to a better future'."
