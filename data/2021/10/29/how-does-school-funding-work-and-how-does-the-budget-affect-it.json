We recognise that in the years following the recession schools have faced cost pressures. That is why at the spending review in 2019 we delivered the biggest funding boost for schools in a decade, increasing funding significantly above real terms per pupil. Since then schools have seen sharp year-on-year increases in their funding levels and yesterday\u2019s commitment is set to continue that."
