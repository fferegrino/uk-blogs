GOV.UK is built on a set of designs, patterns and components; when we update them, changes are deployed across the platform for a consistent user experience."

            "text": "As the component will eventually live in the GOV.UK Design System, we additionally had to build it to the Design System\u2019s principles of usability, consistency and versatility and accessibility. But we also wanted to go beyond just meeting the required standards by building the most accessible accordion possible and share our findings by working openly."

        },
        {
            "text": "The accordion, like GOV.UK, follows the progressive enhancement methodology. We started by making it work first in HTML before adding Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) because HTML is the most resilient layer - even when CSS or JavaScript fail or the user switches them off, HTML will still render correctly. This also means that if the HTML fails, there is no webpage. Progressive enhancement benefits all users because \u201call your users are non-JS while they\u2019re downloading your JS\u201d, so observing it makes your website more robust for all users, another WCAG accessibility principle."

            "text": "We tested across various platforms and assistive technologies because they all interpret webpages slightly differently. We also asked accessibility specialists in the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) to review the accordion as it would be eventually deployed across GOV.UK."

            "text": "We found a few problems including that when a user changed the colour settings in the Firefox browser, parts of the accordion weren\u2019t visible. A user might increase or reduce the colour contrast for comfortable reading if they are visually impaired or looking at a webpage in difficult light conditions, for example bright sunlight. We fixed this issue by using \u201cforced-colors\u201d and \u201chigh-contrast\u201d media query."
        },
        {
            "text": "We also found that when we zoomed into the accordion, the chevron icon did not scale in line with the text. This is because it was originally pixels so we updated it to use relative values or EMs. The update also helped us to meet other WCAG success criteria that relates to resizing text such as WCAG 1.4.4, WCAG 1.4.8 and WCAG 1.4.10."

It meets WCAG and Design System design digital standards and was iterated following accessibility testing."
