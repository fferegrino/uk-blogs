As an example, we can estimate the \u2018funding level\u2019 (financial health) of a pension scheme based on different climate change outcomes. Funding levels can fluctuate.\u00a0 A 100% funding level is generally a target as 100% indicates that a scheme should have just enough money to pay for its members\u2019 pensions. \u00a0A lower funding level indicates that remedial action may be required."

On the other hand, a disorderly 2\u00b0C transition is possible if early inaction leads to a more abrupt repricing of carbon-intensive industries later."

If no action is taken and global temperatures increase by 4\u00b0C, even more disruption is expected with even worse financial outcomes. Shown together in a graph, these scenarios show the benefits of addressing climate change early. (The example is the impact on a pension scheme funding where the lower the funding level is, the worse the financial situation.)"
