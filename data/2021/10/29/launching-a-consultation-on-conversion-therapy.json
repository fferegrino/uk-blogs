Read our Q and A with him where he discusses today's launch of the government\u2019s proposals to ban conversion therapy and the accompanying consultation on a ban, and why it is vital all those with an interest respond to the consultation."

So I\u2019m focusing on the domestic LGBT issues, and also, when it comes to exports, that I\u2019m ensuring the supply chain is as diverse as possible."

That\u2019s because the consultation is not about whether we should ban conversion therapy, but how we ban conversion therapy. People will have views as to how this should be done, and it\u2019s important that we get all of those views. Some of them we will agree with, some of them we won\u2019t agree with.\u00a0"
