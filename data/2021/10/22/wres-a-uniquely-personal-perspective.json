Not surprisingly, these events can have a negative impact on self-esteem."

Whilst there remains an imbalance in the black staff to senior manager ratio, I am fortunate to receive supervision from a mirror image of myself - a thriving, caring and considerate manager, a black woman who validates my experiences, understands my desire for progression and supports me as much as her post allows."

The programme encourages connections between senior leaders and middle managers. I believe it is important for me to learn the rules of engagement or for this blog \u2018initiation\u2019 before I enter the \u2018tribe\u2019 of white senior management."

I am faced with apprehension; \u2018Will I fit in? What parts of myself am I expected to leave behind? Do I pretend to be like them or remain my authentic self? Will I flourish being an African Caribbean leader born in East London?"

            "text": "I have seen movement here in LBBD where black senior managers have been appointed, and I am cautious as to whether the WRES, like many other initiatives, can be authentic in the way it addresses the issue. But I do accept we need to start somewhere, and I am in no way oblivious to the fact more needs to be done within the council and across the social care profession as a whole. I therefore welcome any positive changes the WRES can bring!"
