            "text": "The Draft/Illustrative Electoral Commission Strategy and Policy Statement published by the UK government is a curious document. It seems, initially, a restatement of things the Electoral Commission already does alongside some general statements of the desirability of free and fair elections. Yet, it repays careful re-reading. There are concerning aspects which could potentially be used to impinge upon the independence of the Electoral Commission."

            "text": "The statement begins by stating that it sets out the government\u2019s views as to what the Electoral Commission\u2019s should prioritise. The central point is not recognised that the Electoral Commission is not like other regulators, existing to deliver government policy, but one where independence from government is vital. Instead, the Statement indicates that the Commission \u2018must have regard to\u2019 the government\u2019s core priority functions (paragraphs 2 & 5)."

            "text": "This is unconvincing. The focus on governance and investigative and enforcement decisions appears tightly worded. Immediately before this, there are nine lines setting out the aims of this statement: \u2018to provide guidance to which the Commission must have regard in the discharge of their functions\u2019 (author\u2019s italics). Paragraph 5 extends this to \u2018must have regard to the Government\u2019s delivery of legitimate executive priorities\u2019. This appears considerably stronger than just offering guidance on priorities. Note also that enforcement activity must \u2018have had regard to the statement\u2019.\u00a0"

            "text": "If the second part of paragraph 2, quoted in the previous paragraph, has any weight, readers of the document might wonder what the point of such a Strategy and Policy Statement is. It\u2019s far from clear, that the Speaker\u2019s Committee, dominated by any governing party and given powers to hold Electoral Commission to the government\u2019s priorities, would be able to resist both using them, and commenting on governance and decisions made by the Commission. Other committees and parliamentarians would almost certainly do the same."

There is a coded but relatively clear direction here, that the Commission must \u2018consider[\u2026] carefully the balance between executive priorities in relation to elections as approved by Parliament listed in this statement and their other functions\u2019. The government would clearly like that balance to fall on executive priorities rather than the Commission\u2019s other functions. How this might impact upon resources remains to be seen, but this linkage raises important questions.\u00a0\u00a0"

A successor government, of any party, might choose to do differently. This raises issues about any Statement being under constant review in every parliament, leading to continued uncertainty for the Electoral Commission as priorities change.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "There are important gaps in this Statement. It is unclear how the Speaker\u2019s Committee will use any final statement in its oversight of the Electoral Commission. It is also unclear what will happen if the Electoral Commission prioritises its other functions over the government\u2019s priorities, and what sanctions the Speaker\u2019s Committee will have to enforce this document. Worries must remain about the opacity of the Speaker\u2019s Committee\u2019s business in general, and also given its current single-party majority composition. This is contradictory given the accountability, impartiality and transparency the document argues necessary for the Electoral Commission."

Beyond their role in ensuring transparent, free and fair elections, it is not the role of independent electoral regulators to deliver \u2018legitimate executive priorities\u2019.

It must have regard to all its functions, not just government priorities. While there may be room for improvement, the Commission is already accountable to parliament. The issues the Commission will need to prioritise will evolve over time, possibly rapidly; electoral integrity is a dynamic environment.\u00a0"
