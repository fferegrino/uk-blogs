            "text": "It sounds like a book that the genius neurologist, the late Dr. Oliver Sacks might have written but it\u2019s a true surveillance story that caught the attention of industry professionals last week. \u00a0Suppliers, manufacturers and installers at the Global MSC conference on surveillance and AI came together to share their expertise, experience and knowledge in a dynamic pre-lockdown style gathering.\u00a0 Presenters from oversight, research, policing and local authority backgrounds posed some challenging questions, of themselves as much as of others and one that kept resurfacing was, predictably, the acceptability of smarter surveillance technology within our lives. Less predictable was the news report telling how a traffic enforcement camera had just mistaken a pedestrian in a knitted jumper for a car.\u00a0 Having decided that the word on the woman\u2019s sweater was a number plate, the camera system issued an immediate fine to the bewildered registered keeper of a vehicle hundreds of miles away for driving in a bus lane.\u00a0 His cherished plate is vaguely similar to the word \u201cknitter\u201d as displayed on the pedestrian\u2019s woollen jumper.\u00a0 While somehow farcically reassuring that the rise of the smart machine to replace us all is perhaps further off than some might think, this incident reminded us that, while human surveillance decision-making is approximately right, when the tech fails it\u2019s precisely wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 (This is also one of the 5 reasons why \u201cif you\u2019ve done nothing wrong you\u2019ve nothing to worry about\u201d is probably the poorest surveillance reassurance you can receive but back to the conference\u2026)"

The programme for this return to \u2018old school\u2019 conferencing was energetic and interactive after more than a year of Teaming and Zooming and Webexing.\u00a0 It covered a range of more conventional topical subjects around AI and surveillance with exhibitors and sponsors showcasing what can now be done with the state-of-the-surveillance-art."

            "text": "The principal surveillance question that refuses to go away was naturally facial recognition (plainly not fitted to the traffic camera) and the conference coincided with significant public interest in the use of the technology in schools. I\u2019ve said many times that, in my view there\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with facial recognition technology, live, retrospective or otherwise and in the context of law enforcement it has a legitimate role to play as any other tactical option. \u00a0We\u2019ve been using facial recognition for a while now in our private lives and in other settings it offers some wonderful opportunities to enrich people\u2019s lives, from ensuring the safety of care home residents with dementia to helping visitors navigate around museums and receive a commentary on what exhibit they\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 The exam question this week was the proper place for live facial recognition within a school setting. It\u2019s an interesting one, particularly as I have no direct responsibility for this aspect of intrusive surveillance but the answer remains the same.\u00a0 As ever, it\u2019s the use and the user that are the key and we know from elsewhere in the world that this type of surveillance technology can be used in some very sinister ways under the banner of \u2018education\u2019."

            "text": "\nThe conference considered the regulation of public space surveillance more widely. In England and Wales if the police or local authorities want to use surveillance cameras in public space they have a legal duty to follow the government\u2019s Code of Practice.\u00a0 That\u2019s because Parliament recognised the difference between your decision to sign up to new technology for your own personal convenience and the State\u2019s using it without your express \u2013 or even implied- agreement. The Code says that if there\u2019s a less intrusive way of achieving the same objective, the police or local authority should use it. The same rule would apply in schools and if you can achieve largely the same result by using, say, a PIN or QR code, you should."

            "text": "There are two real challenges with biometric surveillance technology.\u00a0 The first is that it\u2019s SO useful, once you install it for one function you\u2019ll probably want to expand it into other obvious areas.\u00a0 This is why your mobile phone has become the digital Swiss Army knife.\u00a0 Organisationally, if you\u2019ve accepted the case for facial recognition as an appropriate tool in one transactional area \u2013 say paying for school meals \u2013 there will be other equally compelling use cases involving the same considerations and same arguments \u2013 paying for other things like school events or equipment, or the never ending fundraising.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to resist those arguments if you\u2019ve already accepted them once; it\u2019s even harder to resist them when you\u2019ve invested good money in the technology and it can be expanded readily and cheaply.\u00a0 Of course, once you\u2019ve installed the new system, you no longer need the old analogue ways of doing things \u2013 tills, cashiers, desk sergeants \u2013 and so you strip them out.\u00a0 This means there is no \u201cless intrusive\u201d alternative now because you got rid of it, which (artificially) strengthens your case for moving to the new technology in any future settings.\u00a0 This combination of \u2018function creep\u2019 and self-fulfilling proportionality is not so much a problem in your own home but a little more significant when it\u2019s your school or local authority or the police.\u00a0 Even in the school scenario there is an inequality of bargaining power in any consideration of whether to \u2018opt in\u2019 at the start.\u00a0 What does \u2018opting out\u2019 really look like? Is it a once-and-for-all choice or will it come round again in light of experience with the new technology? You can reverse out of many consumer decisions if you change your mind; can you in this case? What are the implications for your opted-out child standing in the dinner queue with their peers? \u00a0It\u2019s easy to see how tasks such as registration and attendance or safeguarding needs in schools would benefit from facial recognition capabilities but \u2018function creep\u2019 would mean you inevitably arrive at a point where the camera in the dining area can recognise who's playing Joseph in the nativity play.\u00a0 With the police your bargaining position may feel even less balanced.\u00a0 You also have to factor in the tech going wrong \u2013 sometimes in ways you hadn\u2019t predicted."

            "text": "The second challenge with biometric surveillance is that it\u2019s so discussible.\u00a0 People tend to have a view on what\u2019s acceptable in the use of intrusive technology for different purposes and when it\u2019s done by the State with all its apparatus of enforcement some feel surveillance monitoring to be highly questionable - especially as the Government doesn\u2019t yet follow its own Surveillance Camera Code; when children are involved the sensitivities and risks are amplified.\u00a0 The law has also recognised the specific vulnerability of children and young people when you capture and retain their biometrics \u2013 in fact this is the reason behind the Protection of Freedoms Act that created my roles and functions almost 10 years ago."

            "text": "But the facts from the last decade show a huge increase in public surveillance.\u00a0 When measured in cameras-to-people, London was recently ranked the 3rd most surveilled city on Earth (having an estimated 691,000 cameras for 9,425,622 people = 73.31 cameras per 1,000 population); in cameras per square mile, that\u2019s 1,138.48 cameras making London the 2nd most surveilled city in the world.\u00a0 Add in mobile camera platforms such as drones and wearable devices and it gets more speculative - and when privately owned and operated cameras are factored in, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess (literally).\u00a0 This increase in surveillance has been matched by the increase in public attention it has drawn. Much harder to quantify, public concern still counts.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t lend itself to worries-per-1,000 parents or miles-by-anxious-motorist but it is as real and present as the cameras in our streets, bus lanes, workplaces and schools."

            "text": "Conference attendees also heard the noise that doorbells are currently making and how their inbuilt cameras are often pointing at more than just the owner\u2019s property.\u00a0 Last week\u2019s county court judgment against a householder who was being sued by his neighbour for interfering with her privacy raised some further, highly topical surveillance discussion. The expansion in privately owned cameras has brought by a corresponding increase, not just in the sharing of stories but the sharing of images, with the police and other bodies, either of the citizen\u2019s own volition or in response to the now ubiquitous appeals for dashcam, GoPro, doorbell or other captures.\u00a0 When it needed a fallible human with a finite attention span to monitor and analyse it, all this newly-enabled aggregated surveillance data had limited practical use: there is simply too much of it.\u00a0 But advances in video analytics and systems for combining, categorising and editing these datasets now allow very significant uses of this new surveillance capability.\u00a0 Again, that\u2019s not a bad thing in itself: every day there are significant investigations of heinous criminality that have been greatly helped by this pooled technology and there will be many more ahead."

            "text": "As the conference also heard, the rush towards omniveillance means shifting from on-premises solutions to \u2018the cloud\u2019 (a brilliantly conceived fluffy euphemism for putting your data and faith in someone else\u2019s computer).\u00a0 This suggests a future where real-time biometric surveillance allows the State to crowdsource video data from companies and public services (like schools) adding in CCTV feeds and AI capabilities. These technological advances will coalesce to allow commercial businesses and householders to \u2018plug\u2019 their cameras into police and local authority networks offering the power for total public surveillance."

            "text": "From the debates and presentations we are, it seems to me, already building a dependency on aggregated surveillance imagery in high harm areas such as terrorism and serious organised crime \u2013 our public services\u2019 reliance on it may soon mean that CCTV forms part of the country\u2019s Critical National Infrastructure \u2013 or at least our critical local infrastructure.\u00a0 And like most of the established critical national infrastructure, it\u2019s largely in private ownership. When the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice was first published, the BSIA put the ratio of private to public cameras at 70:1;\u00a0 it is a reasonable hypothesis that this relative imbalance will have increased exponentially since.\u00a0 Security and intelligence journalist Philip Ingram led us through a fascinating presentation about the critical role that public space surveillance played in the investigation into the Novichok poisoning of UK citizens in Salisbury by Russian agents and spoke of Chinese cameras being installed around the country with \u2018hidden\u2019 latent functionality such as the ability to read number plates (and presumably our clothing).\u00a0 Against this background, the risks highlighted by the Foreign Secretary over the weekend about dependency within parts of our critical national infrastructure begin to move to closer to our high streets, our hospitals and our schools."

The risks from cyber attack and other security related issues are central to the professional manufacture, installation and operation of surveillance systems and are directly addressed in the Surveillance Camera Code.\u00a0 Companies are expected to conduct and report the results of technical penetration tests but what about the ethics of operators and suppliers?\u00a0 How many carry out \u2018pen testing\u2019 of their ethical and corporate social responsibility arrangements at all let alone with the same degree of transparency that they apply to their technical values?"
