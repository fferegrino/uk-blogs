Currently finalising both the scientific objectives and preparing all of the necessary scientific equipment, the crew will depart Southampton onboard Royal Research Ship (RRS) Discovery on 26 November."

            "text": "The ship is the fourth vessel to bear the name Discovery, the first being the barque-rigged auxiliary steamship built in 1901 which carried Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton on their highly successful voyage to the Antarctic. The modern-day RRS Discovery is a purpose-built ocean-going research vessel operated by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). RRS Discovery is nearly 100m long, 18m wide and weighs 6000 tonnes. Fitted with the most up-to-date high-tech equipment and sensors, RRS Discovery is the perfect ship to undertake oceanic exploration in remote and challenging environments."

These different habitats support a multitude of important species, including cold water corals, tuna, billfish and sharks. Areas previously surveyed will also be revisited. By doing this, we can collect time-series data which will allow scientists and managers to begin assessing any changes identified and relate them to the effectiveness of existing management strategies."

Building baseline and time-series data will allow us to identify potential changes to these habitats, such as in water temperature or acidity, in the future. Growing this understanding will help Ascension and St Helena, as well as other Territories, to inform the mitigation of these impacts."

For instance, the positional information of other vessels encountered by Discovery will be used to validate remote sensed satellite data that is currently used to monitor Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) within the EEZs and MPAs of the islands."

During the 10 days we spend around the respective islands, training and learning opportunities will be given on a range of sampling activities and a suite of data collection methods. This knowledge exchange will help to build capacity on island for future research activities."

We will also be mapping the seabed using Multibeam Swath Bathymetry which constructs an image of the seabed using sound."
