As part of the UK's departure from the European Union (EU), the Digital Data and Technology Services (DDTS) Major Projects imports team have been working over the past few years to set up the Imports of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System (IPAFFS) which was launched in time for the end of the transition period in January 2021."

            "text": "To ensure importers were able to manage the new regulations, the UK agreed with the EU three stages of controls for moving goods from the EU to Great Britain. With the stages being introduced at the beginning of 2022, the number of import notifications is set to increase, meaning an increasing workload for everyone throughout the end-to-end journey including border inspectors, importers, and hauliers. We have been looking at how we can improve our services to alleviate pressures of increased notifications as the stages start coming into play."

This will mean that all data around an import will be entered into a digital system and stored along the journey, so will be in one place. This will result in notifications being produced electronically reducing the need for paperwork."

By speeding up the trade flow with an e-notification system, produce is less likely to deteriorate due to being held up at ports. It will also reduce the cost for importers as they won\u2019t need to increase workforces to manage the process."

            "text": "In the long term, e-notification gives us the opportunity to reduce food fraud, a key issue in maintaining the quality of food. With all documentation in one electronic system, imports can be monitored more closely. In the future, we would aim to have electronic pairing which means it would be possible to complete automated document checks to maintain quality of imports."
