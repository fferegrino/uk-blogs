ICES is an international body with 20 member countries and helps to meet societal needs for impartial evidence on the state and sustainable use of our seas and oceans. WGScallop is one of 160 such expert groups which reports to ICES."

Scallop fisheries are one of the most valuable UK fisheries, but prior to this initiative the status of many stocks was unknown."

These areas are often inaccessible to the dredging fleet but may support scallop populations that contribute offspring to fished areas by larval drift."

            "text": "Stock assessments are carried out by Cefas on an annual basis with the main data source currently being provided from the dredge surveys and carried out on a fishing vessel selected and provided by the industry. Scallop dredges do not catch all of the scallops they pass over. Using the ratio of scallops caught, to those in the path of the dredges (gear efficiency), the total weight or biomass of scallops on the grounds is calculated from the survey catches. The level of fishing pressure in each area is presented as the proportion of commercial sized scallops that are subsequently caught by the fishermen (\u201charvest rate\u201d). Simple fisheries models enable estimation of harvest rates that are compatible with Maximum Sustainable Yield[i] and put the observed harvest rates into context. This stock assessment programme has led to other research work as we try to refine input parameters and evolve assessment methods."

The meeting enables ICES working group members to share expertise, data, training and collaborate towards carrying out research on scallop fisheries on both sides of the Atlantic."
