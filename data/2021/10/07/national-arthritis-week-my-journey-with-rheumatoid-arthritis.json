There was information galore, including diet change, exercises and lifestyle changes. One of the things I was advised to avoid was alcohol \u2013 and although I now avoid several other dietary items, I still enjoy a glass or two of Prosecco! Finding a balance between avoiding certain triggers and enjoying myself has been important.\u00a0"

Because of this, the winter is hard and I use heat pads when my joints are playing up. Sometimes I have to go up my stairs on all fours as my knees can not take the pressure of stepping up each step.\u00a0"

Many days I am faced with challenges, from walking down my stairs to getting on a bus (remember those days before the pandemic?) I look after my mum who has advanced Alzheimer\u2019s Disease which means I have to carry on even when I feel like shutting myself away due to the pain."

I count my blessings \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly not all bad \u2013 I live in Peckham and I have prosecco! I am looking forward to the warmer weather which will be here soon and that really helps."
