Policy is often seen as a mysterious \u2018black box\u2019, privy only to the most senior and \u2018elite\u2019 people in government. Even the most experienced civil servants, whose entire career is in policy, have been known to disagree when it comes to defining exactly what policy is."

Without a clear vision of what policymakers do, we run the risk of policy continuing to being seen as a profession open only to insiders or those in the know. And with this comes the risk that policy is made without drawing on the best insights and perspectives. We risk missing opportunities and not having the impact we should for families and communities."

            "text": "This was really brought home to me in the Social Mobility Commission's report from earlier this year. It highlighted that those from more diverse backgrounds are not properly represented in policymaking roles. Whilst everyone knows the role of a lawyer or a finance professional, policy can be seen as vague and ambiguous from the outside. This can act as a deterrent for some people applying for roles - which means we are missing out on talent."

This is a vital step in ensuring that the profession is open to everyone and seen to be open to everyone. Along with ensuring that there are great policy roles and opportunities for progression across the country, I want to make it easier for people to move into policy roles from other professions."

It ranges from designing public services to improve education and health, assessing the infrastructure needs for different parts of the country, ensuring the UK is on track to achieve net zero carbon emissions, and to levelling up the country."
