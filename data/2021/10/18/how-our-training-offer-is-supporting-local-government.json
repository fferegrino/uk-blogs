It gave me permission to step back from the problem being presented, to peel back the layers and understand what the core problems might be.\u201d"

It involves getting customer feedback and going back again, understanding what the user needs me to build for them. I hadn\u2019t heard of that before. It gives you a technique to understand what users actually require - which is really cool. That\u2019s been a problem for planning over the years; we build stuff that we believe is the solution rather than what users actually need.\u201d"

We\u2019ve taken that into our work, to prioritise our backlog in Trello. If a task is high value and low complexity, that means we can deliver it easily, whereas tasks that are complex but high value become a separate project.\u201d"
