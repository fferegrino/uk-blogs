[Credit: Emma Brisdion]The UK Defence Training Estate is home to a diverse range of habitats and wildlife species, many of which have been granted protected status. Through our work with industry partners, conservation organisations, and the UK Armed Forces themselves, DIO is committed to sustainably managing land used for military training and balancing military needs with ecological conservation."

In a joint effort between DIO, Cornwall Wildlife Trust and the British Army\u2019s 165 Port and Maritime Regiment, sand dune habitats are being restored to provide a much-needed boost to the area\u2019s wildlife."

These \u2018dune-specialist\u2019 species thrive in our coastal landscapes when there are plenty of areas of bare sand available for burrowing into or hunting on top of, as well as areas of low grassland in which to hide or to produce flowers."

[Credit: Emma Brisdion]At Penhale Dunes these areas are becoming smaller and further apart due to the loss of natural grazing, climate change and nitrogen increases caused by air pollution. As a result, coastal sand dunes are experiencing significant biodiversity loss."

            "text": "In areas of low scrub, plant material will be raked out, and areas of dense mature scrub like blackthorn and hawthorn will be plucked and pulled from the dunes. In a previously damaged area that is now suffering from lower plant biodiversity than the surrounding dunes, diggers will be used to strip away the top layer of turf to expose patches of bare sand. This will create better conditions for sand dune wildlife."
