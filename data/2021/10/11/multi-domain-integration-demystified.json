What does Multi-Domain Integration look like in practice? And how are Strategic Command going to make this change happen?"

            "text": "Firstly, what is Multi-Domain Integration, or MDI? In the most simplistic terms, it is about ensuring that every part of defence can work seamlessly together, along with other government departments and the UK\u2019s allies and partners, to deliver a desired outcome and defend our nation."
        },
        {
            "text": "But, if we really want to try to understand Multi-Domain Integration, then a good place to start might be to see what it looks like in practice. Let\u2019s go back to 2015, when the world watched as Russia launched an incursion into Syria in support of the Assad regime."

            "text": "The Russian forces were ruthless, effective and, most importantly for our example, they carried out simultaneous military action across all five of the warfighting domains: maritime, land, air, space, and cyberspace."

        {
            "text": "This combination of activities across all the warfighting domains meant that the Russian campaign in Syria was largely successful. It also provides us with an insight into how effective it can be to combine military capabilities across multiple domains, particularly when they work together in an integrated way."

To do this they will have set up an \u2018umbrella\u2019 of defensive measures, designed to deny us access and to prevent us from operating. How would we hope to overcome this challenge and penetrate the adversary\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019?"

        {
            "text": "The operation would be run with our partners across government, such as the intelligence agencies, who would help us achieve the best picture of what is happening in the region. In addition, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office could impose diplomatic and economic pressures on the adversary or their allies as a way of applying additional pressure."

            "text": "Additionally, we need tech to help us plan and train for multi-domain operations. A single synthetic training environment would allow for full virtual mission rehearsal, and incorporate simulators for all the equipment, such as the aircraft, drones and cyber operations, involved. While previously we have had simulators for each piece of equipment individually, joining them together in a unified way is fundamental to preparing for warfighting of the future."

            "text": "We must integrate by instinct. Whether procuring equipment, training, monitoring intelligence or developing operational plans, an integrated approach must be sought. We are best when we work collaboratively and think beyond the silos in which we have often worked."

            "text": "Integration is about giving us options when prosecuting operations. It is not necessarily about using every capability we have, every time we engage."
