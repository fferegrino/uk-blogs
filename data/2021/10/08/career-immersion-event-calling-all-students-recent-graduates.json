Returning for the fourth consecutive year this event is run by a group of some of the UK's largest employers, with the Civil Service is playing a key role!"

Our immersion groups provide an insight into what schemes we have available, how to write a strong application, what career trajectories look like, the opportunity to hear from recent graduates and apprentices, talking you through their journey so far - this is the kind of deep immersion that isn\u2019t available at traditional career fairs! This will be followed by a virtual Q&A session where students are invited to ask questions and air career concerns."
