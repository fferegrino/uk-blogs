            "text": "After what were difficult times over the course of the pandemic, Doncaster children had the opportunity to really thrive this summer thanks to the HAF programme. As part of the wider education recovery effort, HAF is one of the ways the government is helping children and young people catch-up on learning and social development missed as a result of the pandemic. The initiative I worked on, Active Futures Educational Development, was one of many providers who benefited from the funding. This enabled us to offer summer activities for children across three sites in Doncaster."

            "text": "For some children the school holidays can represent loneliness and uncertainty, however the HAF programme was able to offer sanctuary, fun and structured physical activity to some of the most vulnerable children in the Doncaster area. We catered for nearly two hundred children across four weeks of activities, with ages ranging from 8 to 15 and a variety of social and emotional needs."

            "text": "At the start of the programme, they sought regular time outs from activities and relied on the safety of coaches for support rather than mixing with other children. However, by the end, they were a far cry from the nervous, timid child we first encountered.\u00a0They were walking to and from the camps with friends they had made, with transformed confidence and self-esteem. Their journey was heart-warming and gave an enormous sense of pride to all of us who delivered the programme."

            "text": "Other children on the camps became natural mentors, so we created a \u2018buddy\u2019 system, using some of the older children to act as leaders during social times. Time out areas were also introduced, to be accessed when things become overwhelming, or children just needed a break. The activities we delivered allowed for individual, paired and team interactions, and the coaches made sure that groupings were planned with social needs in mind.\u00a0By week three, our young people were delivering activities to the rest of the group with our coaches acting as facilitators. The behavioural change in them was immeasurable."
