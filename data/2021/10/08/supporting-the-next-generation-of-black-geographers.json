            "text": "Originally, I chose geography as a second option. My favourite history teacher left in Year 9 and I wanted to choose history but I knew it would not be the same without him so I chose geography instead. What started as a second option to meet the requirements of the English Baccalaureate grew into a passion, far greater than I had for history, a strong emotion to know more about places and the relationships between people and our environment.\u00a0"

            "text": "I remember writing my personal statement and being asked about my interest in geography and it came so naturally, I was intrigued by the natural features of the earth and the dynamics of our changing world. Not only is geography relevant to current affairs but we are surrounded by characteristics of physical geography in our everyday lives, from the type of soil found in your local park to the drainage of your nearest river. Understanding where things happen and the differences between places is important in many contexts, from agriculture to infrastructure, and housing to the environment."

So, I took advantage of the increased activity on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social platforms to get my message across and to ensure that there would be people listening. Within a matter of weeks, our campaign had reached mainland Europe, countries in Asia, South America, North America and Canada.\u00a0\u00a0"

I am no expert but social media is a very powerful tool and a great way to share your message far and wide. As I discovered with the Black Geographers campaign, you never know where your campaign will end up.\u00a0"

Everything I have been taught thus far in my degree is relevant to current affairs and by the time I finish my degree, I will be equipped with the tools to assist other scientists and researchers working to create a greener planet."
