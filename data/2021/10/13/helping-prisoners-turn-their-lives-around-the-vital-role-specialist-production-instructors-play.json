            "text": "Life inside a prison is about so much more than prisoners moving between their cells and communal areas, and prison officers locking and unlocking doors. There are a whole range of activities underway to help inmates prepare for their release from custody, and many different people in a variety of roles supporting them to do so."

            "text": "Not having a job is one of the key reasons why people reoffend. Having opportunities \u2013\u00a0while in custody \u2013 to access training and learn new skills to increase their employability, can play a powerful part in helping inmates break the cycle. Which is where people like Joanne and Andrew, specialist production instructors (SPI) at HMP Manchester, come in. We sat down with them to find out more about their role."

When I saw the job ad, it sounded very interesting and I thought I\u2019d give it a try. Starting off in the textile workshop, it was an opportunity to use my previous experience in this sector, alongside many years of training skills. After a few years, I moved to the print workshop."

I previously worked in the print industry for 25 years, so have a lot of experience to pass on."

It\u2019s a busy but rewarding job, working with a wide range of people from diverse backgrounds, with varying levels of education, and a range of complex needs. And I enjoy adapting my approach depending on who I\u2019ve got in the workshop each day."

For many, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve had any sort of job, and they enjoy coming to work. Having some structure in their lives and learning a work ethic is a really positive step for them."

Whatever mistakes they have made in life, we are here to help them turn their lives around, and many of them present with complex needs or dependency issues which you need to be aware of. So you need to adapt your approach to working with them accordingly."

I\u2019ve had a few letters from people saying thanks. It\u2019s nice when you get something like that, and shows the positive impact we can have on the people we work with."
