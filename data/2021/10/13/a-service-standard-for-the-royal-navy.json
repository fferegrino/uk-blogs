Royal Navy delivery teams had been working to the Government Service Standard, however some early research suggested that teams would benefit from additional Defence context in the Government Service Standard, which is primarily focused on public-facing services."

We looked to understand what, if any, additional Defence context could be added to support the Government Service Standard and also what materials already exist within the Ministry of Defence, such as standards, policies and best practice that could sit alongside the Service Standard."

Overall, our findings showed a clear need for additional Defence context to be added to the Government Service Standard. These findings can be split into five key themes that teams suggested need to\u00a0be accounted for in the standard from a Defence perspective:"

We chose to add supplementary material as opposed to rewriting parts of the standard and deviating from it. The additional elements are intended to support Defence users in applying the existing standard. Where possible, the content has been kept generic to Defence with any Royal Navy-specific content added where appropriate. This was to ultimately support the development of a cross-cutting Defence Service Standard in the future."
