The discovery phase taught us a lot about the needs of users and it put us in touch with many stakeholders across the industry."

Luckily, through our ability to operate remotely across the UK, the transition was easy and project progress was unaffected. Panel members completed easy, short online surveys on a range of topics including current systems for recording waste, and user roles and permissions."

Response rates for our surveys have been good and the information gathered has been used to define what our users need from a waste tracking service and to understand more about the issues they currently face. This has allowed us to create personas for typical users to help define the functionality of the service."

            "text": "Usability testing of prototypes allows us to gather detailed findings on the usability of the product and use this feedback to improve the design of the service to make it easier and more intuitive for users. A good example of this is when we designed one of our prototypes as a linear journey which required every data field to be completed in turn until users told us that, in the real world, not all of the information is available at the start. Taking on board this feedback we redesigned the journey so that users could complete the fields in any order they wish and use estimated values until the actual values are known."
