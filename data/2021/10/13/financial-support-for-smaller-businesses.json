            "text": "The cut-off point used to differentiate the business size was the number of employees. Smaller businesses, also known as small-medium enterprises (SMEs), had fewer than 250 employees.\u00a0The standout statistic was that of the total number of businesses, SMEs made up 99.9%. Moreover, of the total 27 million in employment, SMEs represented a majority at 61%. The figures also showed SMEs with a borderline majority at 52% of the total \u00a34.4 trillion turnover."

            "text": "Businesses have a number of options when it comes to raising finance. Internally, this may involve using cash reserves and retained earnings or even the sale of assets. In the absence of those options or reluctance to use them, they may then look to external sources."

        {
            "text": "Seeking support outside of a business to raise finance commonly falls into 2 categories, debt finance and equity finance.\u00a0 Through debt finance, the business receives the capital, in exchange for repaying the value borrowed with interest. Whereas for equity finance, the business receives the capital and possibly expertise, in exchange for a portion of their ownership."
        },
        {
            "text": "Sources of debt finance are more commonly used by SMEs as it is relatively difficult to get equity financing at their level. However, for some newer, innovative and fast-growing SMEs, debt finance could be the type that is difficult to access. Seeking sources of equity finance may therefore be a necessary step for such start-up businesses with a higher risk-return profile and less revenue history."
        },
        {
            "text": "There are other sources that do not neatly fall into those 2 categories, such as trade credit and government support. The former is a line of credit, offered from a supplier, allowing the business to generate turnover before making a repayment. The latter may be as direct as a grant or as indirect as the coronavirus loan schemes that were setup to ensure businesses could access the finance they need."

            "text": "Asset finance: leasing and hire purchase are further traditional sources. Usually for financing the acquisition of equipment, rather than receiving money or credit, the SME exchanges regular payments to receive the asset directly."

            "text": "Mezzanine finance: another alternative source of finance. Though found in various forms, the commonality is its unique composition of debt finance and equity finance features. For example, the SME could raise finance through a conditional loan, where if the SME was unable to make the interest repayments, equity in the SME would be exchanged instead."

A takeaway from the latest Small Business Finance Markets Report was the SMEs growing reliance on alternative sources of finance. One example is the increase, over the past decade, in the use of crowdfunding as a source of equity finance for private businesses."

Fuelled by government intervention, markets grew to accommodate this higher demand. Even so, there were almost 400,000 fewer businesses at the start of 2021, compared to the previous year. Not only was this the first material decline in over 20 years, but almost all of the decline came from the smallest of businesses \u2013 sole proprietorships and partnerships."

            "text": "For an investor, committing funding to debt or equity finance presents different risk and reward trade-offs. The availability and attractiveness of the different options will depend on the outlook for those SMEs seeking finance and the level of competition in the market. As the level of government support through the pandemic changes, the favoured source and cost of financing for SMEs is likely to change."
