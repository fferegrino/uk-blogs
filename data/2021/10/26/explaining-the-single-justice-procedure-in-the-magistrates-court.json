It's an accessible, proportionate, effective and more efficient way \u2013 for both the defendant and the courts \u2013 to hear less serious cases that will not involve a prison sentence while maintaining the rigour, fairness and transparency of a standard court hearing."

            "text": "SJP was particularly important during the pandemic, when pressure on the court system increased as social distancing limited the capacity for hearings and some people were shielding. For those who chose to plead guilty, SJP meant that they did not need to attend court and allowed magistrates to deal with their cases from any location. This meant they did not add pressure to magistrates\u2019 courts\u2019 physical capacity and prevented further delay to more serious offences such as assault, sexual offences or burglary."

            "text": "SJP was introduced by the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. It allows prosecutors \u2013 who decide whether a case should be taken through the procedure \u2013 to deal with cases involving adult defendants accused of lesser offences that cannot result in a prison sentence, such as speeding, driving without insurance, TV license evasion and train fare evasion."

            "text": "Defendants receive a notice containing the charge by post, with a statement setting out the facts of the offence and guidance on what steps to take, including their right to a lawyer. They have the option to plead guilty by post or online, or ask for a court hearing.\u00a0 There must be a hearing if they want to plead not guilty, but defendants sometimes ask for a hearing to plead guilty, for example if they want to argue against a driving ban."

            "text": "But predicting defendants\u2019 attendance at court was difficult \u2013 they had no obligation to attend but could do so without notice. This meant magistrate and court time was wasted if the defendant did not show up and the matter was resolved in their absence. Conversely, cases could be delayed if lots of defendants attended on the same day and hearings over-ran."

        {
            "text": "With SJP, a defendant must ask for a court hearing \u2013 court time is not automatically allocated. This gives courts the ability to understand demand and better plan their resources, avoiding wasted time for all involved."

        {
            "text": "It also streamlines activity for other participants in the criminal justice system. Because magistrates read the evidence themselves, prosecutors do not have to attend court to prosecute. Defendants have the same flexibility, either to attend court or plead remotely.\u00a0 Technological improvements mean they can plead online which is simpler and cheaper than by post."

        {
            "text": "There are advantages across the justice system too as we can focus resource on more serious offences. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are only involved in prosecuting cases where a defendant pleads not guilty \u2013 the police prosecute the rest \u2013 so they can focus on more serious and complex cases."
