As we are gradually returning to the office, in a hybrid way, in the Department for International Trade (DIT), we asked teams to share how they have approached this."

Our team has always worked in an agile way so adapted with ease, as daily collaboration and finding new ways to improve is routine. We had daily stand-ups which helped check that everyone was present and coping. Additionally, there were regular retrospectives, health checks, team agreements, a dedicated Microsoft Teams wellbeing channel, and DDaT-wide social presentations."
