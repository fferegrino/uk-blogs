The academic learning has been extremely useful and fits well with a lot of the work I do, but developing new skills and abilities can be used for further knowledge building and development. All aspects of the course build on required skills, the residential schools are extremely good for building close working relationships and trust with others very quickly, working closely together throughout residentials on theories and knowledge, culminating in a group presentation to the school at the end."
