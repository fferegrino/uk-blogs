We have spoken to these customers about how we might improve the service and using their feedback we have added a feature called View My Applications, where users can quickly see all their applications in one place \u2013 with an estimated completion date for each \u2013 and download relevant documents or respond to requisitions directly."

This will enable much more flexibility for team working, which customers have told us is a top priority at the moment."

Information can be inputted and verified by our systems before submission, meaning things such as name or fee errors are identified and corrected before they even reach a caseworker. The guided process also checks that the correct evidence has been supplied. With nearly 20% of all applications requiring a requisition this ability to provide customers with upfront checking will help reduce delays for all parties."

If you haven\u2019t yet tried it then start using the Digital Registration Service\u00a0 today! We will continue to keep customers up to date on new features and new application types and will work with them as we build and test over the coming months."
