            "text": "Answer: Copyright gives you (the copyright owner) the right to exclusively control and exploit your creative works. Copyright exists automatically \u2013 there is no formal registration. You can mark your work with the copyright symbol (\u00a9), your name and the year of creation. Whether you mark the work or not doesn\u2019t affect the level of protection you have. If you create digital images, you should also think about completing the metadata in the file."

            "text": "Photographs will generally be protected by copyright as artistic works. This means that a user will usually need your permission if they want to perform certain acts, such as copying your image or sharing it on the internet. In the UK, copyright in photographs/images lasts for the life of the creator plus 70 years from the end of the calendar year of their death."

        },
        {
            "text": "Answer: No. However, when you join a social media website you should check that website\u2019s terms and conditions to ensure that they are not allowing the website operator to do something with your photographs that you do not want. Their terms and conditions may allow them to use your images for commercial purposes or make your images available for others to use, without your prior permission or notice. This is usually a license to use your works than a transfer of copyright, but it\u2019s a good idea to check."

        {
            "text": "Answer: Copyright does not protect ideas or concepts, but only the expression of those ideas. If you put your project tender in writing or produce visuals to illustrate it, they may qualify for protection by copyright."
        },
        {
            "text": "The distinction between ideas and expression is not always clear-cut. Although taking general or commonplace ideas is unlikely to qualify as an infringement of copyright, taking ideas which are sufficiently well-developed/detailed may infringe. This is because these elements would usually form an integral part of the author\u2019s creative expression. If you believe your rights have been infringed, you could raise this with the company."

        },
        {
            "text": "Answer: If an artistic work like an old postcard or photograph is out of copyright, if that work is digitally repaired or digitised, it is unlikely that it would attract a new copyright. This is because copyright in artistic works including digitised works must be original and reflect the author\u2019s \u2018own intellectual creation\u2019. If you had a dispute with someone about whether a work was protected by copyright, only a court would have the authority to determine this."

        {
            "text": "Even if you could not license or sell copies of digitised or digitally repaired works using a copyright licence, this would not prevent commercial use. For example, providing a high resolution version of the image could have a fee attached, just not make copyright restrictions."

            "text": "There are some exceptions to copyright \u2013 circumstances in which use of a copyright-protected work does not require permission. For example, you can take a photograph of a building or sculpture, provided it is permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public. However, this particular exception does not apply to two-dimensional works like graffiti. More information about exceptions is here."

            "text": "As a result of a number of international agreements, including the Berne Convention, the UK generally provides reciprocal protection to works created in most other countries. The Berne Convention provides that works will receive automatic protection without formality. You may still choose to mark your work with the copyright symbol (\u00a9), your name and the year of creation. More information is available here."
