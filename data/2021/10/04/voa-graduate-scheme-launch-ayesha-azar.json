This was the first time I had heard about the VT and wanted to know more. After speaking to senior colleagues, I found out about the VT process and what it meant to be a Chartered Surveyor. I felt both fascinated and inspired."

Initially, I was unsure if I would be able to cope with the additional studies while working and balancing my family life at the same time. But I made the decision to apply, which was one of the best decisions in my life by far."

During these years I was blessed with my son, now 12 years old and my daughter who turned nine earlier this year. I also suffered a further bereavement, losing my only, and close, sibling. During this incredibly difficult time, the support and encouragement of my wonderful husband and supportive colleagues in the VOA was so important for me \u2013 I\u2019m grateful to them for helping me through a hard period while ensuring that I could pick up where I left off when I was ready."

I completed my BSc in Estate Management in 2015 but did not attain the 2:1 grade, which was an essential requirement for RICS APC (assessment of professional competence) - another reason for me to stop dreaming about being a Chartered Surveyor. However, this was when I needed to gather all the confidence within me and seek help to find a way forward."
