He will tell us his story of how he went from training for one of the world\u2019s toughest ultra-marathons to terminally ill in just 36 hours and the impact that his diagnosis had on his and his family\u2019s lives! Tony will also tell us everything that we need to know to help men be proactive about their prostate health and get diagnosed early when prostate cancer can still be cured and there are much better outcomes."
