As an apprenticeship is specifically designed to allow\u202fan employer to take on an individual\u202fthat shows enthusiasm and aptitude rather than pre-existing\u202fskills, apprenticeships have allowed us to bring people from all backgrounds into our workplaces. It is also bringing women into traditionally male areas, such as metal work, carpentry and technical\u202ftheatre, and men into areas\u202fusually dominated by women, such as costume and scenic art.\u00a0\u00a0"

These occupations will provide the foundation for high quality technical education across apprenticeships, T Levels and higher technical qualifications.\u00a0\u00a0We have\u00a0also\u00a0analysed whether the standards include the right balance of knowledge,\u00a0skills and behaviours to allow an individual to become fully\u00a0competent in the occupations. As part of this review, we have recommended changes to 15 standards and agreed a set of principles which should be considered for\u00a0the development of\u00a0future standards. These principles include\u00a0ensuring that the content\u00a0within the\u00a0standards is transferable across the full range of employers\u00a0who\u00a0employ individuals in an occupation, that the language is\u00a0accessible to\u00a0all and that\u00a0the\u00a0standards\u00a0reflect the latest technological developments\u00a0in the sector.\u00a0This will ensure that\u00a0the technical education offer is of the highest quality for learners and provides organisations\u00a0with\u00a0employees who have the right\u00a0skills for their business.\u00a0"

This model makes it\u00a0very difficult\u00a0for companies\u00a0to take on a full-time apprentice. This has led to some great work between industry and government to unblock the barriers employers are facing. ScreenSkills are currently running a\u00a0flexible apprenticeship\u00a0pilot\u00a0in order to enable apprentices\u00a0to have\u00a0several work placements\u00a0during their training, including working on Netflix and WarnerMedia productions.\u00a0The pilot has received funding from Department for Culture Media and Sports with Government announcing a new \u00a37 million flexible apprenticeship fund to support the creation of more flexible apprenticeships.\u00a0\u00a0"
