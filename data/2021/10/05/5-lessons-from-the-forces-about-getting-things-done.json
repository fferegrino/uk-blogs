Negotiators sought a peaceful release until, on the sixth day, a hostage was executed. Almost immediately, two small SAS teams stormed the building and, in a 17-minute raid, rescued the remaining hostages, killing five of the gunmen and capturing the sixth."

How is it that 30 people can do what 30,000 can\u2019t? And how can we apply some of the Armed Forces\u2019 \u201cget it done\u201d ethos into our everyday work?\u00a0 So when Brigadier Marcus Reedman and some 50 members of the Forces joined the Cabinet Office COVID-19 Task Force, I jumped at the opportunity to work shoulder to shoulder with them.\u00a0 "

Unlike the public sector where the end-point typically follows the completion of certain necessary steps, the military approach is, \u201cI need to achieve x and I only have y amount of time and resource. How do I do that?\u201d\u00a0 Time matters hugely, and it\u2019s important to use what you\u2019ve got, not what you wish you had. \n\nOrders set direction but aren't set in stone\nContrary to popular belief, orders aren\u2019t followed slavishly. They\u2019re designed to allow autonomy and the application of judgement, within boundaries. With a strong emphasis on the \u2018why\u2019 - the purpose - they set out the \u2018who\u2019, \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019.\u00a0 But the \u2018how\u2019 is left to the person on the frontline - because they\u2019re best placed to judge how to achieve The Effect with the resources they\u2019ve got.
