            "text": "Data licensing is a difficult subject to get excited about. It is quite often seen as something that has been put in place to block access or prevent users from doing what they want to do with the data. It can involve lengthy and sometimes impenetrable legal terms. And yet these are terms that we are legally bound to stick to. It is no wonder that data licensing has such a difficult reputation."

            "text": "So, let us start with some basics. Data licensing is a legal process that enables holders of data to share their data with others, as long as they comply with certain terms and conditions. Even open data is delivered under a licence."
        },
        {
            "text": "There are a number of reasons why we might want to set terms and conditions on a licence. Maybe there is some third-party content to protect. Maybe there are security concerns so the use of the data needs to be restricted, or caveats around the provenance of the data, or its capabilities that need to be drawn to the attention of end-users. Or maybe there is some personal data included and the data owner needs to make sure that whoever uses it has the right to access it, and complies with data protection legislation. A licence in these circumstances enables publishers to protect and share their data responsibly, rather than lock it away and refuse access."

        {
            "text": "Maybe we need to change the term from something that sounds officious to something helpful like \u2018data sharing\u2019. Because that is what we want a licence to be. Something that helps us share data, that maximises use. Not something that blocks access.\u00a0"

Through that of the person trying to access the data."

This allows anyone to freely access data for research, development and innovation purposes."

            "text": "The benefits of the licence were seen by the National Archives who built on the work of the DEL and went on to adapt it to replace their current developer licence. Developer Licence 2.0 supports the mission of the UK Geospatial Strategy to make data more accessible and to encourage re-use, under the UK Government Licensing Framework (UKGLF) and offers the potential to unlock the significant economic opportunities offered by geospatial data."

            "text": "We are on a journey, and admittedly we are not there yet. Changing something as long-standing and legally complicated as licensing takes time, but everything we have worked on so far has laid the foundations for us to continue to push at the barriers, and make accessing our data simpler and quicker. Over the next year, we hope to roll out more harmonised licences, to keep working together and to keep striving to make things better."
