This follows-on from an important earlier announcement - in April of the same year - that it was creating two Areas to be Avoided (ATBA) around the islands in the archipelago."

            "text": "The ATBAs are voluntary and request that all vessels above 400 tonnes adhere to a 25 nautical mile exclusion zone around Tristan. This action, by the Tristan Government, was a direct response to the danger of shipwrecks such the MS Oliva in 2011, which caused significant damage to Tristan's marine environment and lobster fishery. Quite naturally, this event led to a wider concern that Tristan could be exposed to further pollution incidents for which it would be unable to provide an effective and adequate response. Therefore, the Tristan Government decided that the best approach would be the creation of two ATBAs, which would minimise the risk to the island from maritime accidents."

Well, that's where the Blue Belt Programme lends a hand- by assisting Tristan with surveillance and improving compliance with the ATBAs."

            "text": "The monitoring of vessel automatic identification systems (AIS), is key to the Blue Belt Programme's surveillance of Tristan's ATBAs. AIS is primarily used by vessels to avoid collisions in the water; a transceiver on the vessel sends a signal to satellites, or land-based receivers, which identifies their location, speed and course, and allows other vessels to 'see' them.\u00a0 This information is increasingly being used to monitor vessel movement and can be integrated into online tracking systems. The Blue Belt Programme has access to two different and complementary AIS tracking systems to monitor Tristan ATBAs."

            "text": "Between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021, AIS surveillance identified 109 vessels which had transited through the ATBAs. Of those 109, seven vessels were within ten nautical miles (nm) of an island - and therefore considered high risk. For example, this year a fishing vessel entered the Tristan Group ATBA, heading straight for Nightingale Island. Fortunately, nine miles from the Island, it changed course avoiding a serious collision. AIS is mandatory in the Tristan EEZ for all cargo vessels over 300 tonnes and all passenger vessels."

Therefore, the Blue Belt Programme is currently trialling a new system called NovaSAR as it is particularly beneficial in the surveillance of dark vessels."

SAR is a form of radar used to create two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes. It uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region to provide a clearer image, than that received by AIS."

If the trial is successful, the combined use of NovaSAR and AIS (any detections through NovaSAR are manually correlated with AIS) will significantly help in the monitoring and identification of dark vessels."

There have been three 21st century shipwrecks around the islands which are shown and described briefly below. Of the three, the 2011 MS Oliva wreck, referred to in the article, could have been avoided if the vessel had adhered to the ABTA rules, but it carried no proper chart and its crew were negligent in other respects. Even under the modern ABTA surveillance system errant vessels are very unlikely to be contacted during their voyages to be warned. Certainly no such communication would have helped stop the oil rig being wrecked in 2006, as no-one was aboard, or the MFV Geo Searcher which was a bona fide Ovenstone fishing vessel operating off Gough Island."

It was released by the tug in early March, was lost but found by islanders in June marooned off Tristan's Trypot Beach. It was later towed to sea and sank 10km off the island at a depth of 3500m. Environmental damage was probably limited to a small oil slick and the arrival of invasive Brazilian porgy fish."
