With a background of typically having just 1 central CRM application and a telephony solution to navigate, getting my head around what each of these resources did and how to navigate them felt like a mountain to climb."

Not only did this create a perfect environment to learn and grow, it also provided me networking opportunities and to meet other people that can give me a better understanding of how the role of ADM fits in and supports the wider needs of the MoJ/OPG."

Just as everyone else had been up to this point, this team were all extremely welcoming, supportive and talented in their fields. Everyone was willing to give me their time so that I could pick their brains and, importantly, find out what they expected from me so I could support each individual as well as the team collectively, in the best possible way. So off I went, that support always in place if and when I needed it, I was now a working ADM supporting and hopefully adding value to vital MoJ services.\u00a0"

However I have never before experienced such a welcoming and comfortable environment to excel in this new career, and that's a testament to extraordinary people within the MoJ. "
