People with autism have great skillsets to offer an organisation and yet, according to the latest ONS report, only 22% of autistic adults are in some form of employment. As such, we wanted to support NAS\u2019s Autism at Work programme to develop an autism- friendly recruitment process that helps more people with autism secure work at DE&S and join a diverse and inclusive workplace where they can really make a difference."

We tailored our job advert to ensure it was autism friendly, created information packs, and a video tour to give candidates an accurate representation of what it is like to work on site. We also amended our interview process to include a practical assessment that was tailored to the vacancy,\u00a0 which candidates could complete prior to the interview. Once the campaign closed, NAS conducted the CV sift and passed us the CVs of the candidates who met the essential criteria requirements, who have now been invited to interview and we are excited to see the results. The successful candidate will be hired on a Fixed Term Appointment (FTA) contract for 23 months, will receive full pay and have access to DE&S benefits. Once the FTA comes to an end, the candidate will have the opportunity to apply for a permanent position"

The recruitment process can present major barriers to autistic candidates due to features of autistic communication and thinking style. Autistic communication style can be literal and direct while thinking style can be logical and concrete. This, along with sensory differences and differences in body language, means that autistic candidates may have the skills and abilities to succeed in a role, but may not be able to demonstrate this in the typical assessment process.\u00a0 In order to break down these barriers, we worked with the team at DE&S to develop an autism friendly recruitment process. The enthusiasm and strong commitment from the team at DE&S and their openness to suggestions for alterations to the recruitment process have made this a very positive partnership'."

We use our wide experience of living with autism and working with autistic people to inform our work with employers. Despite an increasing awareness, stereotypical ideas about autism still exist and our most important message to employers is that autistic people are infinitely varied. They may share a diagnosis, meaning they have differences in communication style, thinking style and the way they perceive the world in a sensory way.\u00a0 However, they all have their own very individual autism profile, including strengths, skills, abilities and ambitions. In my role, I am often asked what kind of roles autistic people can do, and the answer to that is that there is no limit, it is entirely dependent on the individual. In the right role, an autistic employee is often able to outperform a non-autistic colleague due to a laser like focus and expert knowledge'."

To solve complex problems, a variety of thinking styles is required so that issues are considered from different perspectives. In addition to attracting talent, a diverse and inclusive workforce brings further advantages the whole organisation. For example, all employees feel more motivated when they feel that their individual needs will be understood and that they are able to be\u00a0their true selves at work'."
