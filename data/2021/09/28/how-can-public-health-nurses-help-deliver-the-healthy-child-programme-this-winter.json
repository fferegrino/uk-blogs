            "text": "Winter is a time when we traditionally see many coughs and colds in children. This year some winter illnesses are peaking earlier as there has been limited mixing due to lockdown restrictions, which means children haven\u2019t had the exposure to many of the viruses they normally would have. Health visiting teams and school nurses will play a vital role in ensuring parents are aware of these illnesses and will be well placed to promote and signpost parents to information to support their child\u2019s health and wellbeing and how to protect others."

            "text": "As winter approaches, health visiting and school nursing services can use their clinical and public health expertise as well as their trusted relationships with children, families and communities to raise awareness of winter health issues and how to treat or prevent them. They can offer health promotion and prevention strategies including immunisations, such as the seasonal flu vaccine which comes in a painless nasal spray for school children. "

            "text": "One winter illness peaking early which health visitors and school nurses will be aware of is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Cases of RSV are higher than we would expect to see at this time of year as a result of fewer infections last winter due to the various COVID-19 restrictions in place. While still at low numbers, respiratory infections in young children are expected to rise as we go into the winter months."

        {
            "text": "Most cases of RSV are mild and clear up within 2 to 3 weeks without the need for treatment, although some children have severe symptoms and may need to go to hospital. The early symptoms are similar to those of the\u00a0common cold, such as a runny nose, a cough and a high temperature."

This programme provides vital protection to children and young people and results in indirect protection to those around them, including infants, older people, and those in clinical risk groups."

Using their leadership, public health expertise and contacts with children and families, they can offer advice, guidance and reassurance whilst also support parents in ensuring children are healthy."
