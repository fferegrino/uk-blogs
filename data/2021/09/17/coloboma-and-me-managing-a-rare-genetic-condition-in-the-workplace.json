            "text": "I was born with a coloboma in my left eye. This is caused by a rare genetic condition and means that my eye didn\u2019t form properly in the womb. It is sometimes referred to as a cat\u2019s eye as the pupil is misshapen, often towards the bottom of the eye. It means that I am almost blind in that eye and I had my first pair of glasses at nine months old (I still have them!). The gene abnormality has also caused severe hearing loss in my right ear and I wear a hearing aid, but this link wasn\u2019t made until later in life."

            "text": "When I was a child, my parents were told I would have to attend a special school for the blind and partially sighted but my father, who had experienced attending a school for people with health needs, fought against this and I attended mainstream school without any problems. I was lucky that my parents bought me up to be quite resilient and I rarely struggled with being \u2018different\u2019."

I have a specialist chair and ergonomic mouse with the short keyboard and our Digital, Data and Technology department were great at helping me set up my font size on screen so I can read things with ease."
