It is one of the most significant animal health challenges that England faces today, costing taxpayers more than \u00a3100 million each year. In 2020 alone, more than 27,000 cattle had to be slaughtered to curb its spread."

Where necessary, APHA may carry out further testing through laboratory culture of tissue samples collected at PME or PMMI to identify the causative bacterium."

The pathologist will look for visible signs (lesions) characteristic of bTB which may be present in certain organs and lymph nodes of the carcase if the disease is sufficiently advanced in the animal. Animals which have tested positive for the disease are considered infected and represent a risk to other animals and are therefore removed straight away from the affected farm without re-testing."

Furthermore, although visible lesions of bTB are usually found in the respiratory tract and associated lymph nodes, their location can vary depending on the route of infection into the animal. The size and number of visible lesions (if present) can also vary and is not always correlated with the length of time an animal might have been infected."
