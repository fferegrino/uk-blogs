Over the next four years they will each receive a share of \u00a316 million from the Nature for Climate Fund, to restore peatland. This is Natural England\u2019s first round of NCPGS Restoration Grants, with more rounds planned for the next two years."

They cover 10.9% of England\u2019s land area. Unfortunately,\u00a087% of\u00a0our peatlands are\u00a0degraded. In this state, they do not capture and store carbon but emit an estimated 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year."
