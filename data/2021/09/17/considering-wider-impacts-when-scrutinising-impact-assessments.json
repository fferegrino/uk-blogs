We assess whether the evidence and analysis in the IA is fit for purpose or not. This scrutiny process helps to improve IAs and therefore supports better policy decisions by Ministers."

Instead we comment on whether they provide sufficient support for decision-making on these aspects of the assessment and then use a quality indicator of \u2018good\u2019, \u2018satisfactory\u2019, \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019. Our best practice guidance states that wider societal impacts should be considered in every IA and included in the net present value estimate of the true cost of the regulation."

'Brexit' provides opportunities to ensure that the regulatory system is as effective as possible in encouraging trade and innovation. Hence, it is \u00a0increasingly important that the wider impacts of regulation are considered in IAs so that these factors can be balanced alongside the more direct impacts on business. Similarly, the commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050 means that it is important to understand how a proposed regulation will impact on greenhouse gas emissions and help (or hinder) the UK to achieve its commitment."

It would do more to ensure that an evidence-based approach is taken to assessing the potential impacts of new regulations on innovation, trade and the environment. The aim would be to improve the analysis of these wider impacts in the same way as the current analysis does for direct impacts on business."

An important question is therefore which of these wider impacts are the most important to analyse in order to ensure that a balance is struck between proper consideration of these issues while ensuring that the regulatory process does not become too superficial, onerous or time-consuming."

The RPC is working closely with the Department for International Trade to support its work on ensuring that trade agreements are targeted where they can most benefit the UK economy. There is therefore a case for increasing the focus on trade impacts in IAs for regulatory proposals."

An increased focus on this in IAs might help decision makers in making difficult choices on measures that improve the environment but have a cost to businesses, or that improve consumer welfare but have an unintended adverse impact on greenhouse gas emissions."

However it \u00a0is important that any new system is proportionate and that the IA focuses on the areas that are most relevant to the proposed legislation."
