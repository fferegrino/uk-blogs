When we make them available on GOV.UK as PDFs, they are\u200b\u200b harder to use, less accessible, and take more time than a digital form to complete and process. As a department, we continue to rely on these types of forms for a lot of our business.\u00a0"

However, we didn\u2019t have a clear understanding of the problem - how many paper forms are there across MoJ and what kind of support might their form owners require?\n\nA team was established in April to run a discovery to investigate the types and levels of support needed and to understand the size of the problem.\u00a0"

This wasn\u2019t a straightforward question to answer and required a lot of chasing and spreadsheet crunching. \n\nDuring the discovery we defined and tested three support models:"

HMCTS are establishing their own team of user-centred design professionals to tackle their forms but are keen to continue to use MoJ Forms.\n\nIn addition to these existing paper forms, there is a growing number of teams looking to create new forms but who lack digital specialists. \n\nThe discovery also validated some of the work we were planning to do in the team already, including:"
