            "text": "Instead, last winter was dominated by the impact of COVID-19, which posed serious health risks to care staff and people receiving care, with knock on effects on care home staffing levels, facilities and equipment. This winter will be highly unpredictable, and the big concern is the extent to which we may see flu and other respiratory viral infections re-emerge as major health threats, alongside coronavirus."

            "text": "Implications for social care staff, vulnerable people receiving care, and their families, friends and loved ones are serious. An Academy of Medical Sciences report warns very low levels of influenza activity over winter 2020/21 and the mild influenza season in 2019/20 make it likely our overall immunity to influenza will have diminished. This makes the urgency of taking up the flu vaccine this winter more important than ever."

            "text": "We have seen a phenomenal response to the COVID-19 vaccine offer, with the vast majority of social care staff now fully vaccinated and better protected, which is a fantastic achievement. I ask all care colleagues to do everything they can to make sure we see higher than ever levels of flu jab take up this year. These jabs save lives \u2013 and isn\u2019t that why we all do the work we do? Please get both and get double the peace of mind."
