            "text": "Over the last couple of years, a group of farmers, supported by vets, specialists and Defra colleagues have worked together to design a way to help fellow farmers bolster the health and welfare of their stock, whilst at the same time improving their bottom line. We\u2019re calling it the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway."

            "text": "Right at the outset, it was evident that the farmers\u2019 own vet needed to be at the heart of delivery and veterinary input has been immense in guiding us up the first steps of the Pathway."

            "text": "The programme is set to start in Spring 2022 with a vet visit. This will be paid for by the government. They will undertake a health and welfare review of the farm, including diagnostic testing, to set the foundations for the journey along the Pathway. The initial focus will be on improving disease prevention and controlling or eradicating an industry agreed list of diseases in each species."

            "text": "The ambition is that over time everyone, including your neighbours and small scale producers, will be engaged, thereby reducing the risk of re-infection to those who have forged ahead with the programme. We\u2019ll have to remain flexible as we progress to long term delivery, as lessons are learned and implemented."

We know they would like to do something about it, but don\u2019t or can\u2019t because of the risk of reinfection of disease. The difference with this programme is that everyone will be working together towards the same goal."

            "text": "There are big wins here for the public purse, too. A higher health national flock or herd will have a reduced need for veterinary medicines, reduce the effect on the environment and underpin our international reputation for good health and welfare, bolstering our export opportunities."
