You don\u2019t have to know about its inner workings. Someone else has taken care of the hard work - leaving you to focus on delivering what\u2019s distinct and valuable about your product or service."

            "text": "Platforms expose functionality and data, through open and standardised APIs, which teams can use to deliver their services quickly and easily. Some of those services may in turn be platforms themselves, with others building on top of them, or reusing them; for example, our payments platform uses our notifications platform, which in turn runs on our cloud hosting platform. Platforms emerge to encapsulate and solve common problems, and can provide a growing ecosystem of applications and features which are built on top of them."

It is \u201cstructured information\u201d breaking down into reusable \u201cchunks\u201d of content, reusable and applied based on context."

A fundamental rethink and redesign of the architecture and infrastructure of the GOV.UK publishing and presentation applications, as well as a change in how the teams sustaining all of this are organised and work. Our cross-government publishing users will see improvements through a more cohesive and intuitive set of publishing tools, and public users will have a more personalised and relevant experience."
