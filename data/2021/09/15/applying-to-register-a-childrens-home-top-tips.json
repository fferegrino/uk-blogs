We need a separate application from the provider and from the manager, and we treat each application separately.

This seriously delays an application because we must wait until the new person fills out the application form, and we start again to get all the checks back that we need. We cannot go forwards with the rest of an application if one part of it changes. We must wait until that part has caught up to where everything else is."

Although you can apply before your premises are ready to be used, your home must be ready for children to live in (with no outstanding planning permission applications or ongoing building work) before we can grant your registration. This is entirely your responsibility. It often causes delay in registration because we cannot move out of stage 2 while this information is missing. That is why it is better for you to have everything ready before you apply, rather than applying and hoping that you can \u2018get things fixed\u2019 as the application progresses. There is more information on planning permission in the next section of this blog post."

For example, you do not need to provide a specific telephone room for children, but you would need to think about how children can have private conversations with their family, friends or any professional who is supporting them."

            "text": "Another cause for delay is not sending in the right paperwork. Although our online system tells you what to provide, it does not check the content.

Regularly check in with your individuals about how their application is progressing. We do not let you know if there are delays with their applications. Encourage all the individuals named on your SC1 form to fully complete their SC2 form and check that they have given us everything we ask for. Common reasons for their delay include:"
