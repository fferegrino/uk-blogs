If I'm working on something new, I'll organise a kick-off to double-check I have all the information I need and then I will code either in a pair or on my own. I would normally work on things like building a new feature for our web app, a maintenance task for our infrastructure, or sometimes fixing a bug. Around once a week I'm on the support rota, which means answering technical queries from our users and keeping an eye on our logs and metrics to make sure everything is running smoothly."
