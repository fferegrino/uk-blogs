However, very little is known about what happens at an investiture. So, let me fill you in on what happened when I received my OBE for services to the community."

I had a spring in my step for months while I had to stay quiet. When I finally broke the news to my family, they were over the moon - as were many people I\u2019d worked with over the years, who saw it as recognition for their own efforts.\u00a0"

Oh no, only you, as the recipient, are offered a glass of sparkling water or juice. Meanwhile your guests - you\u2019re allowed up to three - are escorted to a grand room and directed to their seats.\u00a0"

Then came the moment when his fixed expression changed \u2013 his mouth contorted and he looked down at his legs, trying hard to stop them from shaking. Looking at the line, we could only assume his son had stepped forward."
