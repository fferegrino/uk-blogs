            "text": "Last month, the first ever CHART (CatcH And Release Tagging) pilot programme went live in England, with the start of the 13 week-long Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ABT) \u00a0fishing season. From 16th August, flying their specially designed CHART flags and with the benefit of favourable weather conditions, the first week of the CHART programme saw 12 of the 15 permitted vessels and 53 anglers embark from ports in South West and South England, on their first legally permitted trips in search of these incredible ocean giants."

            "text": "This milestone day represented the culmination of months of effort.\u00a0 Scientists, policy makers, recreational anglers, skippers and conservationists had been working together since September 2020 to develop a trial programme. Earlier in the year,15 experienced skippers were carefully selected by Cefas, following a rigorous application and evaluation process, to join this unique collaboration, with a mission of working directly with Cefas fisheries observers, scientists, as well as other organisations, such as the Marine Management Organisation, Natural England and various stakeholder groups including Bluefin Tuna UK.\u00a0 Their mutual objective was to collect data to improve the scientific understanding and management of bluefin tuna."

            "text": "In addition to providing important scientific data, CHART aims to bring economic benefits to coastal communities, by enabling paying recreational anglers to encounter these amazing apex predators up close. In recent years, the number of reported sightings of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna has been increasing in UK waters. They have been observed more frequently in our coastal waters, particularly during the late summer, autumn and winter as they feed on energy rich pelagic fish, such as sprats and herring, in waters around the UK. There are multiple and complex reasons why their numbers may have increased, such as conservation measures\u00a0and\u00a0climate change\u00a0impacts, including\u00a0abundance of prey\u00a0and changes to the marine environment."

But we still don\u2019t understand enough about these incredible predators; CHART offers the potential to fill gaps in our knowledge of their distribution, movements, behaviour, numbers and demographics. Training the skippers to carefully tag the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna, as well as how to collect data on their size, fishing effort and sightings will enable us to develop a clearer picture of ABT in English waters.\u201d"

Combining the scientific expertise of Cefas, with the great experience of seasoned UK Charter skippers and anglers with notable experience of large pelagic species, we have a programme which will deliver important scientific data, real economic benefits to coastal communities, and an opportunity for anglers to engage with this iconic sportfish in a professional, managed environment.\""

These impressive statistics represent the combined effort of the many individuals who have joined forces to ensure CHART meets its aims.\u00a0 Just some of them are featured here, but all deserve thanks for their commitment and achievements."
