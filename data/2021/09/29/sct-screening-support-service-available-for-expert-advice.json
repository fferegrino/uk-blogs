            "text": "There were noticeably fewer enquiries from clinicians during the first period of \u2018lockdown\u2019 restrictions, compared to the previous 6 months. We thought this was probably related to a reduction in face-to-face appointments and prioritisation of more urgent medical referrals at the time."

        {
            "text": "During the first lockdown period, we noticed an increase in enquiries about incidental laboratory findings from patients which were neither antenatal nor newborn screening related. This may have represented a slowdown in work in some laboratories and possibly more time to investigate unusual results. This apparent increase appeared to be short-lived as it did not continue into the second lockdown period and beyond."

            "text": "Some clinicians sought to reduce hospital / GP appointments, especially when there are vulnerable family members who needed to shield. There were a few requests for guidance about the re-issue of maternal/paternal results from previous pregnancies."

            "text": "The numbers of Hb Variant queries reduced during the first few months of the pandemic but have since returned to pre-pandemic levels. These queries were mostly in the antenatal category. We also noticed an initial drop in beta thalassaemia related queries, but they have increased more recently and are mostly related to concerns over borderline Hb A2 levels and Hb A2 levels that differ between pregnancies."
