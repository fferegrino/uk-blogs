If a child cannot see the board properly or read their book it can affect their progress at school. Reading is key to unlocking the rest of the curriculum for children and we know those who struggle to read will struggle in all subjects not just English. Even more significantly, research shows that children from disadvantaged backgrounds who read habitually for pleasure can overcome their circumstances and even outperform more affluent pupils."
