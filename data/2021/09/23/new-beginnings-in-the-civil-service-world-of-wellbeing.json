This is in addition to my role as Disability Champion, which has been very fulfilling over the last year, but on which there remains much more to do. I\u2019ve learned so much from meeting disabled colleagues, champions, and networks, and am looking forward to doing the same on health and wellbeing.\u00a0"

I maintain my enthusiasm by trying new sports - my latest is hot yoga. I am truly terrible at yoga, but that\u2019s no reason not to do it! Exercise makes me feel happier, makes me feel like I can accomplish hard things and makes me resilient.\u00a0"
