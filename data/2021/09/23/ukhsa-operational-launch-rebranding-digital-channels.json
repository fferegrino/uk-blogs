At this point, PHE will transfer its health protection functions into the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and health improvement / healthcare public health functions into the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I) and NHS Digital. NHS Test and Trace functions will become part of the UKHSA."
