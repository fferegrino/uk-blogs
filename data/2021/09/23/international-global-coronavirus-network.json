In the last two decades we have seen three coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2) emerge from animal reservoirs with devastating effects on human health and society. Of course, the most recent, SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, has resulted in a global pandemic that has killed over 2 million people so far, destroyed livelihoods and caused a degree of upheaval not seen since World War 2. We are all more than familiar with this pandemic and its global effects unfortunately!"
