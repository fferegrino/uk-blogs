Before qualifying as a social worker, she gained experience at after-school clubs, summer camps abroad, mother and baby units in hospitals, and as an advocate for tackling substance misuse. Now, as a co-founder of the non-for-profit, PinPoint Incorporated, Patriche along with her fellow directors focus on developing positive change for underprivileged children and young people within inner city communities."

            "text": "Growing up I didn\u2019t know anything about social work. When I went to school in East London, I started to witness and experience racism and inequality. It really stuck with me that young people were going through terrible things without any support around them. As a young adult I was lucky enough to have access to personal development courses which helped develop my self-esteem and confidence. I used the skills I learnt to help my friends when they were struggling and started to see that supporting people was something that I was passionate about. This led me to think that maybe I could offer young people something that was clearly missing throughout my teenage years."

After I\u2019d reported the incident to an LA, I tried to follow up with them, but understandably, they wouldn\u2019t tell me what had happened. The experience left me feeling powerless. Wanting to make a difference in situations like this led me to study a degree in social work at Goldsmiths College, University of London."

I believe social work should be authentically community-led and I find all the different parts of the role encompass different aspects of myself. \u00a0The profession should have the space to focus on what we are here for; supporting families and helping children to feel happy, fulfilled and live life in a beautiful way. I\u2019ve seen children as young as 2 years old lose their spark and innocence. I want them to hold on to that for as long as possible. All of my senses and my interests are engaged when working with the community and I know I\u2019m in a privileged position to have the confidence to assert myself to help others."

As a Black female social worker spending time within the community, for example in a hair salon, barber shop or market during non-working days, I might see things going on around children that make me pause, but I\u2019d never say I was a child and family social worker in that space. Many Black social workers feel the need to protect their identity within and outside of the community because of the weight \u2018social graces\u2019 may hold. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there; I hold on to an element of hope that some Black and Ethnic Minority children will see my journey and know there is more than one path open to them."

            "text": "We are seeing a disproportionate amount of Black and Ethnic Minority social workers failing to complete the Assessed and Supported Year in Employment\u00a0(ASYE), spending long stretches in junior roles and even being investigated. Black staff are often more readily blamed when what they need is support. Personally, I know it can feel like a lot of pressure being a Black, female social worker. I have often felt more responsibility to progress further, faced higher expectations from white professionals and held a different relationship and level of responsibility when supporting Black and Ethnic Minority families. Too often, Black practitioners are undervalued in comparison to their white counterparts who are delivering the same quality of work. Black professionals are often expected to achieve more in order to be acknowledged or progress in their career."

One space is for Black and Ethnic Minority professionals within Camden\u2019s Children\u2019s Services to think about our workforce and what action is needed to encourage an anti-racist workplace. The second space is for all practitioners within Camden\u2019s Children\u2019s Services to come together to focus on how we can continue to develop anti-oppressive and anti-discriminatory practice holistically. We discuss our experiences and concerns, but we are also very focused on actions and making a tangible, positive change for our work force and our communities. With support, I have also set up Black safe spaces within the Looked After Children and Care Leaver's Team, and we are in the process of creating Black safe spaces within the Child in Need and Child Protection service."

            "text": "These are small, intimate spaces but more widely, Camden Children\u2019s Services has an anti-racist work plan which all teams feed in to. We consider how we can ensure we practice in anti-racist way. I am also part of a catalyst group where myself and others, including managers from different services, share their voices and advocate the needs of front line to create authentic change. The group acts as an advisory function to the service, ensuring our anti-racist work plan is systemic and not just a \u2018tick box\u2019 exercise."

I also attend BASW\u2019s Annual General Meeting and have been named equality and diversity lead for BASW\u2019s steering group for the Independent Review of Children\u2019s Social Care.

She uses this platform to share honest advice to social workers at all levels about connection, reflection and growth."
