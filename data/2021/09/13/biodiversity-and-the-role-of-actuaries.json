It\u2019s something that I have been increasingly worried about as I\u2019m very passionate about conservation of natural habitats and animal welfare."

            "text": "Zoonotic diseases are diseases that have been transmitted from an animal source to a human. An animal can carry an infectious pathogen that is passed on to a human, through close contact, and then, in some cases, once the species barrier is crossed, the disease can develop and spread among humans."

            "text": "Once a new zoonotic disease emerges, the impact can be devastating \u2013 as we have seen with COVID-19. There can be increased mortality, but there are also wider effects on society, including disruption to the economy and health services."

            "text": "Indeed, almost half of the zoonotic diseases that have emerged since 1940 have resulted from changes in land use, farming and food production practices, and wildlife hunting."

        {
            "text": "In theory, a greater amount of biodiversity could potentially reduce the transmission of zoonotic diseases as there would be several species the disease has to pass through to reach humans. This highlights the delicate balance of the natural world and the huge impact human activity is having."

This could be for example, through mortality impacts of a constrained food supply, insurance losses due to supply chain disruption from crop failures. Or it could be through investment risks from reduced asset values due to a transition to a more environmentally conscious financial market."
