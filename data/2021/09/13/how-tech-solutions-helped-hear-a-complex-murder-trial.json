            "text": "COVID-19 meant that our operational staff across sites in England and Wales had to adapt to find creative and innovative ways to list cases with multiple defendants. Alongside HM Prisons & Probation Service (HMPPS), HMCTS has developed and implemented new technology to make it possible to hear more cases through audio or video links. All these factors came together recently, when my team worked with others across the criminal justice system to successfully run a murder trial involving multiple defendants (often known as \u2018multi-handers\u2019) at Preston Crown Court. But it was far from straight-forward."

But since COVID-19 has accelerated digital reform at HMCTS and HMPPS, audio and video are more accessible, reliable and effective. Our staff have become more familiar with these systems, with the skills and confidence to use them as solutions to operational challenges."

We identified use of video as one of the most effective ways to get around the issue of space availability. We consolidated these findings into a multi-hander \u2018toolkit\u2019. Using this toolkit, the Preston team \u2013 led by delivery manager Julie Hitchen \u2013 set about exploring the video solutions that were available, achievable, appropriate and legal. We then began an intensive planning period during the run up to the trial date itself."

They listened to their concerns, and developed a proposal that would not only help overcome the operational issues faced, but instil confidence in the ability of the court to make the trial happen."

The video link connection to the courtroom was through a newly installed Cloud Video Platform (CVP) room at the prison. CVP \u2013 an internet-based video meeting service that works a bit like Zoom \u2013 is one of several technological solutions that HMCTS and HMPPS have accelerated over the past 18 months and has been a real success story of court-working during the pandemic."

Police officers, journalists and relatives of those involved were all able to join the trial from their respective offices or appropriate locations. This helped to further minimise footfall and freed up space in the courtroom and building, including court cell space so that other hearings and trials involving a defendant in custody could also continue."

I am also entirely satisfied that the vital requirement of access to justice was preserved throughout. I have nothing but praise for all those involved in bringing this ship home to port.\u201d"

By deploying video to hear this trial, which successfully concluded last month, we saved the department significant costs in prison transport and resource. And by confining a case that could have sprawled across the entire court, to just 2 linked courtrooms, we estimate that over the 10 weeks we saved capacity at Preston for up to an extra 50 trials, 250 sentencing hearings, and 20 appeals \u2013 not to mention around 500 pre-trial preparation, case management, pre-trial review, and mentions hearings."
