We received around 20,170 valid CS claims, which is an increase of more than 25% compared to last year. Our teams are busy working hard to prepare to make payments to customers from 1 December and we\u2019ve already completed all of the necessary checks on over 3,700 CS Revenue claims."

The final deadline for receipt of applications was 30 July 2021 and by this point, we received nearly 10,400 Mid-Tier and Higher-Tier applications, an increase of over 2,000 compared to last year.\u00a0 These are now being processed and we will start to send out agreements in the near future."

We know that farmers play such an important role, and these applications will help to look after and improve the environment in many ways. This includes conserving and restoring wildlife habitats, preserving historical features in the landscape, flood risk management and encouraging educational access. We are grateful we are able to work together with our customers to deliver the CS scheme. 2023 will be the last year for applying for agreements (to start in 2024), and by then we will have the new environmental land management schemes in place as an alternative."
