First and foremost, it is a form of science. So, initially data is extracted from digital devices and then rendered into a useable form. This data is then processed and interpreted to be used as intelligence for investigations and as evidence in criminal proceedings."

            "text": "There are many tools at our disposal to extract and interpret this data and as a Forensic Practitioner, it is important to understand what the data is showing us, as well as where the evidence comes from. With technology always evolving, we are constantly adapting our processes to understand the data better. It may sound a little intimidating, but the work is both exhilarating and rewarding as we encounter new challenges each day."

            "text": "So, what is a typical day like? Well, as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, no two days will ever be same. The core responsibilities of course start with forensic examinations of digital devices that range from laptops, desktop PCs, USBs and even CCTV units. We then capture a forensically sound image using software only available to law enforcement for further analysis. While many of these devices are commonplace, you can never let your guard down. You may encounter unexpected obstacles, such as high-level encryption, which are becoming increasingly common to even the simplest of consumer devices and require more unique methods of extraction."

There is certainly a wide variety of things to get stuck into and many opportunities to develop and specialise in skills and areas that interest you."
