As an organisation, we were well placed to react when the pandemic struck, and online tools and platforms have enabled us to collaborate and work effectively during this period. These have also allowed us to continue growing our team and we\u2019ve worked hard to help new starters to integrate \u2013 be that by delivering office equipment to their doors, or simply cultivating an open and friendly digital workspace."

Everything was completed online. Normally, attending an interview in person requires travel and other arrangements, which I personally think adds to the pressure. I found being interviewed remotely more like a switch on, switch off task. From the interview, and through the whole HR procedure, everything was completed online."

I now realise it\u2019s one of the benefits of being a civil servant, especially here in Defra. It\u2019s surprising just how much of my work can be done online, sitting anywhere in the country, especially working in a technology role such as mine. That flexibility offers big work / life balance benefits."

However, finding the right job, one that suits my skills and interests and with a future career pathway, was equally important. That\u2019s when I came across this Data Analyst role in Defra. Coming from a family with a background in farming and living most of my life in a rural area, I always considered myself a supporter of the environment. Alongside my passion for technology, my relevant degree, and my keen interest to work within a government sector, I couldn\u2019t have found a role or an organisation that were better suited for me."
