            "text": "As Niamh described a few weeks ago, the idea of using multidisciplinary teams to support policymaking is nothing new. It\u2019s a term that\u2019s been around for a decade or so and an idea that was driven by the push to make things more open, the need for greater collaboration and the emphasis on understanding the often complex lived experience of people impacted by public policy."
        },
        {
            "text": "All that now matters more than ever before. Policymakers increasingly work in environments that are messy, ambiguous and uncertain; designing, developing and testing policy at speed and at scale. It can be genuinely difficult to comprehend some of this if you\u2019re outside of government. And it\u2019s hard."
        },
        {
            "text": "Making a success of multidisciplinary team working is also hard. Sure, there are examples of doing it well \u2013 both of us have spent time in highly effective teams that can readily claim to have been multidisciplinary \u2013 but it\u2019s never been easy."
        },
        {
            "text": "That\u2019s because expertise and skills are constantly evolving \u2013 in a good way: think about the recent and rapid growth of data science and behavioural economics for example \u2013 funding arrangements might need to change so you can sustain digital delivery and governance might just need to be done very differently."
        },
        {
            "text": "All of this is invasive to existing norms, pushing at the boundaries of how teams and organisations work but none of it can be made to work without having the right people, the right conditions and a right way for the team to communicate."
        },
        {
            "text": "That\u2019s the challenge \u2013 the idea of building a different, better, environment for multidisciplinary teams to work in \u2013 that we\u2019ve been looking at here in DWP."

            "text": "We\u2019ve started by taking a critical look at the people we could and should be involving. That might seem obvious but it\u2019s easy to get stuck in doing the same things. And if we\u2019re honest about it, a lot of talk about being multidisciplinary actually revolves around digital teams, so we see and hear about roles involving products, engineering, security and so on. They\u2019re really important \u2013 essential if you\u2019re developing digital services \u2013 but they\u2019re not normally enough, which is why we\u2019re very deliberately looking to involve more policy people."

            "text": "Whether it\u2019s helping someone get back into work, start a new business or access healthcare advice, policy outcomes are largely delivered through services. Policy and services are then pretty inseparable: for most of the public, the policy is the service and, in turn, this is their experience of how government works."

            "text": "They make a huge difference to the ability to experiment, test ideas and learn about what might work before making big investments. We just need to make it easier to get people from divergent backgrounds to work together \u2013 Andrew calls this the \u2018conductor\u2019 role \u2013 and do more to create a common language."

            "text": "Some of this is basic stuff. To pick an example, we\u2019ve got a big commitment to making kit work well for everyone so that software tools, data and prototype ideas can be shared and collaborated on, regardless of where you sit in an organisation or what kind of device you\u2019re using. That\u2019s fundamental to how we work but it\u2019s not always been a walk in the park and we could and should be better."
