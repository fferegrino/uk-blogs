This is the question the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) posed as part of a Defra-funded test and trial."

They provide us with data to identify how we can improve the way the schemes work. But these studies are usually conducted by field researchers and ecologists. The RSPB-led test and trial sought to understand whether farmers could help through the self-assessment of their own agri-environment agreements."

            "text": "This helped us to expand what we learned \u2013 allowing us to determine whether photographs could provide a cheaper alternative to adviser visits to help verify results. By winter our advisers were able to get back out on farms \u2013 so we could test both approaches side by side."

They show that there was very little difference between the farmers\u2019 own assessment and that of the adviser.\u00a0 This test has shown that for the habitats assessed, self-assessment does appear effective at validating the delivery of wildlife public goods."

            "text": "We were able to explore the farmers views on the current approach to inspections and evidence keeping. Overall, the perception was very negative. The farmers felt that the current system is too focussed on quantity rather than quality of delivery; a perception that inspectors were there to find fault; and a feeling that current penalties are disproportionate and punitive."
