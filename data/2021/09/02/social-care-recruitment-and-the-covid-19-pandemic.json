From the pressures of minimising the spread of the virus among vulnerable people in care homes, to increased work pressures on staff, and difficulties in maintaining effective support for home carers, the sector has really struggled to navigate its way through the pandemic."

On 11 November, it will become mandatory in England for anyone working in adult care homes to demonstrate they\u2019ve had both doses of the vaccine, unless they have a medical exemption. This has been put in place to maximise protection for colleagues and vulnerable residents and \u2013 by extension \u2013 the wider community around our care homes."
