The US/UK scientific and research community played a critical role in the early days of the pandemic, leading to the extraordinary discoveries of new life-saving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. However, there is still uncertainty about what lies ahead in this pandemic, and what may come next. This event offers a chance to hear from leading figures in government, science, and business. They will discuss the critical role of US/UK research at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing efforts to distribute vaccines globally. They will share their perspectives on how the UK/US Joint Statement on Pandemic Preparedness and G7 commitments to future pandemic preparedness might be achieved through the 100 Days Mission."
