Policymakers say they are driven by a sense of public duty and do their job because they want to help others. So they need little convincing on the importance of delivering public services that provide citizens with high value. But in practice the path to delivering services that are inclusive can be fraught with challenges."

            "text": "Policymakers value good evidence and use it to underpin the delivery of public services that are meaningful to citizens. They regularly work with experts like analysts, economists, statisticians. But even though policymakers and ministers alike think a holistic evidence base - that includes citizen insight - is a persuasive way to inform ministerial decisions, they rarely include it."

            "text": "This is problematic because if we want a public service or policy to be inclusive, we must fairly understand the needs of people that will use it and how they will respond to the intervention. If policymakers don\u2019t do this, then some groups of citizens might be treated differently from the original policy intent, which ultimately delivers less public value - and just isn\u2019t fair."

The problem with this approach is that it requires policymakers to fill in the blanks using assumptions based on their own frame of reference. This risks unconsciously excluding those whose background and experiences differ from their own."
