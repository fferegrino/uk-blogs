Recommendations are based on clear scientific evidence and weighing up the pros and cons to ensure that screening is beneficial for large populations but also that the potential to harm an individual person is minimised."

            "text": "The UK NSC is very interested in AI, which shows promise for improving a number of screening programmes and is developing rapidly. The UK NSC has an AI task group including experts in AI, clinicians and public and patient members. They have a vital role in horizon-scanning and look at evidence for AI, concentrating on those areas where it shows most promise for early use in screening."

            "text": "There are several studies looking at commercially available or experimental AI systems with test cases. In these evaluations no AI systems were as good as the system of 2 expert human readers we have currently, though a few achieved similar accuracy to one reader under study conditions. There were no studies at all which showed the impact of AI in practice, and this evidence is critical for the UK NSC recommendations."

This is a rapidly advancing area and the UK NSC and the AI task group will continue to review and focus on the developing evidence. The committee will look for studies that show benefit from the use of AI in the screening pathway."

            "text": "This could be that it replaces scarce human experts, is more cost effective, or that it picks up more early stage cancers and reduces harm from cancer without leading to unnecessary extra investigations for women being screened. If or when AI is demonstrated to improve screening the UK NSC may recommend its adoption into the UK breast screening programme as a major modification."
