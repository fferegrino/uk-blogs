            "text": "By moving to a new technology platform we\u2019ve been able to reduce the complexity of the technology that sits underneath our digital services. This makes the existing services easier to monitor, maintain and develop \u2013 improving stability for our customers and colleagues \u2013 and provides a flexible foundation for new services in the future."
        },
        {
            "text": "We\u2019ve done this by using containerisation technology and container management platforms. The simplest way to describe this new technology is that the platform works like a flat Lego board that you build your applications, or containers, on \u2013 each of which can be moved around separately while retaining the same foundation. A container packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one environment to another. By using this approach, development and implementation is simpler, so making new applications or services available is less time consuming and easy to distribute."
