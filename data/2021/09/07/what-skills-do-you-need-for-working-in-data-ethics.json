Similarly, the consultation response to the strategy stressed that data ethics should be at the heart of government data operations, and indicated the need for improving ethical norms and standards to guide data sharing across government.\u00a0"

In order to develop the Data Ethicist role, we surveyed 50 data and AI ethics professionals from all sectors on what skills are necessary in their job. We then ran a workshop with 25 data ethics practitioners to get a deep dive on what the Data Ethicist role should entail."
