            "text": "The Better Regulation Framework (BRF) covers both businesses and civil society organisations (CSOs); however, the current focus has very much been on regulations as they apply to businesses. Indeed, the recent government consultation on the BRF does not even mention CSOs."

            "text": "Like businesses, new regulations can have significant impacts on CSOs. But CSOs often experience impacts that differ in nature or scale from those experienced by businesses. Developing a more targeted and nuanced approach to identifying the costs and benefits of new regulations to CSOs could help ensure that they don\u2019t face disproportionate burdens from new regulations, and thereby better support them to grow and thrive."

They are formed to serve many different purposes, but generally their purposes are non-profit making and often, but not always, they focus on achieving charitable aims or societal goods."

CSOs play a significant role in our economy - the UK has over 166,000 voluntary organisations and the sector employs approximately 910,000 people, although many more work on a voluntary basis with over 2 billion hours spent volunteering each year \u2013 equivalent to the combined employment of the manufacturing, construction and real estate sectors. The voluntary sector contributed \u00a318.2 billion to the economy in 2017/18, representing about 0.9% of total GDP, but this ignores the social value created \u2013 the value placed on charity by its direct recipients and also the indirect value to others in the community."

During the pandemic, the need for some CSOs\u2019 services, such as charities providing foodbanks and shelter have skyrocketed. However, the difficult economic environment and Covid regulations hit some CSOs very hard, resulting in decreasing donations, loss of employees and volunteers, and severely restricted activities."

In our experience, this often results in under-identification and incomplete analysis of the impact new regulations may have on CSOs."

            "text": "CSOs vary more widely in their structures than businesses, so it isn\u2019t a straightforward process to determine to what extent they are impacted by new regulation. The current BRF doesn\u2019t differentiate between businesses and CSOs \u2013 the implied assumption is that CSOs are expected to experience the same impacts from new regulation as businesses. Unfortunately, the lack of data and appropriate guidance about CSOs means there is a lack of focus on how CSOs may be differently impacted by regulatory proposals. The current BRF doesn\u2019t give policymakers the right tools to analyse CSO impacts and can result in this sector being overlooked or impacts on CSOs being underestimated."

            "text": "If the impacts on CSOs aren\u2019t identified and quantified, there is a risk that CSOs could face disproportionate and unintended impacts from regulation. One option would be to enhance the current BRF, by expressly identifying areas where CSOs may experience impacts differently from businesses in the impact assessment (IA) template. \u00a0Another more radical possibility would be to require a Civil Society Organisation Assessment (CSOA), along the lines of the Small and Micro Business Assessment (SaMBA), which brought a much greater focus on ensuring new regulation worked for SMBs."

            "text": "Providing more guidance for policy makers about how to analyse impacts on CSOs, including appropriate use of methodologies and metrics would also help. And improving collection of and access to underlying data about the number, size, and activities of CSOs would better enable departments and regulators to produce better IAs. This would aid ministers and parliamentarians in deciding the types and levels of regulation appropriate for CSOs and avoid CSOs facing unintended consequences from more general regulations."

We encourage you to share your views on these important issues. The deadline for responses is 1 October 2021."
