Even if you don\u2019t currently work with Parliament, it still affects your work regardless of your role, and attending the workshops will help you contribute to the Civil Service behaviours of \u2018seeing the big picture\u2019 and \u2018developing self and others.\u2019\u00a0 Most attendees so far have been from the London area and we'd really like to attract some interest from colleagues across the UK at all grades."
