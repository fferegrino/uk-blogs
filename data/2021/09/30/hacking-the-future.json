It\u2019s an event where participants come together to explore solutions to a knotty problem and team up to produce a working prototype. This can then be built on with more traditional project management. Our Champions applied this idea to the Civil Service."

The most effective responses involved these sectors working together, collaboratively tackling challenges using their different approaches, resources and experiences. In short: action beyond simply pondering policy from your desk in Whitehall."

We invited participants from a range of private, public, higher education and charity organisations, and let them talk to civil servants from across our Champions network. We then set the group the challenge of what it would take to improve collaboration across boundaries - one of the objectives of the Declaration on Government Reform."

We heard that changing culture and behaviours, building trust, and making it easier to find each other were the greatest blockers to collaboration. Some were practical issues around how we are organised, while others were more ethereal, such as challenges around the cultural divides that needed to be resolved."

            "text": "In our second task, we asked the groups which areas of work benefitted most from collaboration. \u2018Wicked\u2019, complex problems that transcend organisational boundaries popped up. Issues like tackling childhood obesity, net zero or rehabilitating offenders required multiple organisations with different perspectives and capabilities to come together - highlighting the huge potential to do good if we got this right."

            "text": "Secondly, a focus on the macro. There was a worry that collaboration couldn\u2019t happen organically.
