It comprises of over 170 lakes, and is an incredibly important place for biodiversity, recreation, continued mineral operations and education. The mixture of all these activities side by side really does make Cotswold Water Park a very special and unique place.\u00a0"

            "text": "\u00a0Just 10 out of more than 150 lakes were designated as a Site of Scientific Special Interest (SSSI) back in 1984, but since then, and with more lakes being created, the bird and aquatic plant populations have continued to grow. It now holds over 35,000 wintering waterbirds and significant numbers of breeding birds including little ringed plover, little egret and nightingale. The scrub and reedbed are full of breeding warblers including reed, sedge and Cetti\u2019s warblers, blackcaps and willow warblers. The Park is also nationally important for four species of stonewort including the lovely pointed stonewort. This makes it nationally significant and therefore Natural England have expanded the designation to include 177 lakes. \u00a0"

            "text": "The Cotswold Water Park is a very dynamic place, with ongoing mineral and significant recreation activities. The wildlife has thrived alongside these activities, and in many cases, it is these activities that have supported the wildlife by creating the different mosaics of habitats required by different species. Examples of this include sailing clubs regularly pollarding trees and angling clubs maintaining scrub around their angling lakes. Many owners actively manage the lakes and surrounding habitat for the benefit of wildlife, and some lakes are specifically kept for conservation. All of this has contributed to the wildlife we see today, with birds being able to move to different lakes at different times, and therefore are able to thrive alongside recreation.\u00a0"

In addition\u00a0without a\u00a0wider designation future development\u00a0proposal\u00a0on the existing lakes\u00a0could really begin to have an impact on bird and plant communities. Rather than the increases we had been seeing over the last 10 years, the scenario that we would begin to see declines was\u00a0a very real threat.\u00a0"
