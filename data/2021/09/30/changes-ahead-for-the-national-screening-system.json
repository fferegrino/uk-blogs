I'm sure this could be applied to all our lives in all sorts of different ways but at the moment the big change for many of us is that after 8 years, Public Health England (PHE) will cease to exist from midnight tonight. Whilst that signals a period of change for many of us in public health, it also opens up a number of opportunities for screening."
