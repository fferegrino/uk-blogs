In a nutshell, the Defra library team provides essential services and resources to enable colleagues to access the information they need for their work. It\u2019s that simple. Well, almost\u2026\u2026"

Although we sit within DDTS, we provide a range of information resources and specialist library services to colleagues across many areas of the department including some of our Arm\u2019s Length Bodies such as the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Natural England (NE)."

Libraries Week is an annual showcase and celebration of the best that libraries have to offer, with a focus in 2021 on celebrating the role of libraries in supporting active and engaged communities. Although the event is largely focused on the ever-important public libraries, libraries are everywhere, including workplaces, universities, and government departments such as Defra!\n"

A couple of years ago we had a colleague that really needed to know what was discussed every morning on Farming Today on BBC4 but didn't want to get up at 5.30 to listen. They contacted us to see if we could help. We managed to get hold of the PDFs of the transcripts and added these to the catalogue. They became really popular; as it turned out, there were quite a few people in Defra that had an interest but usually missed the early morning radio programme."

We do have a collection based at the APHA site in Weybridge, for those colleagues who prefer to look through the physical resources themselves. The Weybridge library collection has recently been expanded to include books from Natural England's collection, formerly based at Peterborough and now accessible to staff across Defra."
