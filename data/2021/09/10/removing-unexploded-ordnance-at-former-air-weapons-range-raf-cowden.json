To do this, we\u2019ve worked closely with local authorities and organisations including the Ramblers to ensure that the public are aware of the clearance activities taking place at RAF Cowden. We\u2019re also working hard to reduce the risk to the public and reduce the burden on emergency services."

It\u2019s normally focused on supporting international partners, but the CEDE Office was asked by the organisation to take on the challenge of a contract at RAF Cowden in 2020 and has recently deployed a contractor to provide urgent operational cover at two other air weapons ranges."

We also measured the noise levels and described time restrictions to demonstrate the care we take to manage any impact on the local environment."

            "text": "The MOD team answered many questions throughout the day, including about communications with local council members, managing access to the beach and safe removal of all waste materials. Finally, we visited Mappleton beach to see examples of UXO contamination, the effect of coastal erosion and observe a live explosive ordnance disposal. The effects of the tides were also evident as we drove off the beach and all the visitors reflected on the challenges of the project."

            "text": "Overall the visitors\u2019 day went extremely well and everyone went away with a greater understanding of the unique issues at this site and our equally unique solutions to ensure the area remains safe. The MOD, commercial and local stakeholders witnessed the success of the CEDE Office's government assured, contractor delivered model, engaged with each other and provided valuable feedback to enable us to continuously improve providing these services."
