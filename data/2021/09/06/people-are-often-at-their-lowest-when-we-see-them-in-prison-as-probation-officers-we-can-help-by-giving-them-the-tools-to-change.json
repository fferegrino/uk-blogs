It can be busy working full-time as well as studying, and it\u2019s a steep learning curve at times. But there\u2019s support available from your practice tutor, line manager and university staff. And, when it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in, it makes it much easier."

I did a placement in a category A and a category B prison while studying for my PQiP. One of these was at HMP Lincoln. So, when I\u2019d finished my training and was asked to submit an expression of interest for a probation officer vacancy, I opted for one there \u2013 and got it."

These provide recommendations on whether I think an individual should be released or not, based on my assessment of their risk of harm and reoffending.

Individuals are often at their lowest point when we see them in prison, and they have to want to make changes to turn their lives around. As probation officers, we can help by giving them the tools to do so. One of my proudest moments was working with a man who was on a life sentence after being been recalled to prison for reoffending. After completing some motivational and other offending behaviour work with me, he regained contact with his family and child, and was accepted for parole."

If you want to do a job that makes a real difference both for offenders and victims of crime, I\u2019d recommend studying for the PQiP."
