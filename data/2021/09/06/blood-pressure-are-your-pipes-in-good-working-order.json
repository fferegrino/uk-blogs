            "text": "High blood pressure (or hypertension) is often known as a \u2018silent killer\u2019 because most people show no symptoms. If left untreated it can increase the risk of heart attack, heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. Recent evidence shows that it has been linked to more than 8.5 million deaths world-wide and that rates have doubled to 1.2 billion globally over the past 30 years."

            "text": "More than 4.3 million people in England with high blood pressure go undiagnosed and untreated. Of those who are diagnosed, about half are optimally treated in line with NICE guidance. This places a considerable burden on the NHS, costing an estimated \u00a32 billion every year."

            "text": "High blood pressure is also associated with 2.6 times higher odds of severe COVID-19 and 2.5 times higher odds of mortality from COVID-19. High blood pressure is preventable, and for those with high blood pressure a reduction of just 10mmHg can significantly reduce their risk of a heart attack or stroke. This means identifying, diagnosing and managing hypertension is more vital now than ever."

Doing so offers the potential to prevent 150,000 heart attack and strokes over the next 10 years."

NHS England and Improvement\u2019s BP@Home initiative, the recently announced free blood pressure tests in pharmacies, and the focus on blood pressure assessments in the Primary Care Network (PCN) planning guidance, are helping to move us a step closer to improved rates of detection and management that other countries such as Canada have shown are achievable."
