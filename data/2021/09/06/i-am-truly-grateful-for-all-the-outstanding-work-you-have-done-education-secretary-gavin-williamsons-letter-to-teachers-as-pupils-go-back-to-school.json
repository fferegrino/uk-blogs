Evidence continues to suggest\u00a0that cases in education and childcare settings reflect community transmission, including social contact between children and families, and that overall children and young people are much less susceptible to\u00a0severe clinical disease. We also know that missed education has significant impacts for children, young\u00a0people\u00a0and adults."

All other 16- and 17-year-olds are also eligible for a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It has also been recently announced that people over 12 who were severely immunosuppressed at the time of their first or second dose should be offered a third dose."
