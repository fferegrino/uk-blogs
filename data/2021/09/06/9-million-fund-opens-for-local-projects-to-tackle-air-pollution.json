At least \u00a31 million of the \u00a39 million available this year will be dedicated to projects to improve public awareness in local communities about the risks of air pollution following a recommendation in the Coroner\u2019s Prevention of Future Deaths report after the tragic death of Ella Kissi-Debrah in 2013. Local authorities can also bid for a portion of the fund for a wide range of other projects to create cleaner and healthier environments."
