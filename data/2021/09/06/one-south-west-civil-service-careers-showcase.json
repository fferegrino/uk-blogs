The event will include an introduction from senior leaders in the Met Office, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Valuation Office Agency and Department for Work and Pensions. Following that, there will be the opportunity to be involved in discussions with members of staff from those departments, to find out what it is like working there."

The team are called G.R.O.W Your Career and they identified a lack of awareness around the variety of Civil Service opportunities across the South West. This is the first in a series of virtual events to highlight the range of departments and career paths available. It will provide a chance to find out more about people's roles in other departments and create connections."
