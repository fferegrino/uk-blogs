Set up to support a growing community of organisations working together, the Declaration outlines our shared vision to deliver more user-centred, cost effective, local public services through open, collaborative and reusable work."

We've also helped to develop Open Referral UK, the national data standard for human services, which makes it easier for residents and council staff to find the right support in their communities - 10 organisations are already compliant with the standard."

In 2020, we launched the C-19 Challenge, which focused on combating some of the challenges local authorities faced as a direct result of COVID-19. More recently, we launched the Continuous Funding Model (CFM) to offer a more flexible way for our funded projects to apply for additional funding at the end of each phase."
