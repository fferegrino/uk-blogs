The findings supported DAC\u2019s assessment that overall, conditional reveals are fine \u2014 as long as they\u2019re kept simple. This was also supported by our conversation with the ARIA Working Group, when they said they did not see the notification as a WCAG 2.1 requirement. In fact, they wanted to see evidence that it\u2019d be useful to users."

If it decides not to approve our proposal, we\u2019ll remove it from the Design System. Until then we think it\u2019s useful for screen reader users so we\u2019ve left it in."
