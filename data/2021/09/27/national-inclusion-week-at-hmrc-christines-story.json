We celebrate National Inclusion week to recognise the support we offer to colleagues to make sure no one is left out. This year at HMRC, we\u2019re celebrating with a three-part series of stories from colleagues across the department."

This has meant further considering how we can all help each other to be more inclusive, whether that\u2019s through flexible working or extra support from one of our Employee Networks."

        {
            "text": "My role on the team is mainly fact finding. I get information from the corporations and interview employees, carry out investigative work and then educate corporations on better practices when needed. It\u2019s important to get the right results because it levels the playing field and it helps the country fund schools and hospitals. It feels good to be on the right side."

            "text": "I needed specific qualifications to get on my team, but they were all paid for by HMRC as part of Tax Specialist Programme. They\u2019re also underwritten by Manchester Metropolitan University so it\u2019s an actual degree - it\u2019s just one of many avenues for people to try and progress at HMRC."

            "text": "It\u2019s a report that helps your manager understand what can be done day-to-day to reduce stress and if you move roles or departments, it goes with you, so you don\u2019t have to go through the same discussions with a new manager. It was an absolute life saver because it meant other people understood what stresses and strains you were under."

            "text": "With my Carer\u2019s Passport, I was able to work 5 days over 4 days which allowed me to attend medical appointments and look after my mum. I also had some reasonable adjustments for exams due to menopause symptoms. The support was excellent and far beyond what I had expected."

It gives you some coping mechanisms as well. Some people may not realise the effect being a Carer has on your mental health, so it\u2019s great this is recognised and there\u2019s extra support available. Mental health is very much a changing picture within HMRC and it\u2019s great they're constantly working hard to make sure that people are listened to and supported."
