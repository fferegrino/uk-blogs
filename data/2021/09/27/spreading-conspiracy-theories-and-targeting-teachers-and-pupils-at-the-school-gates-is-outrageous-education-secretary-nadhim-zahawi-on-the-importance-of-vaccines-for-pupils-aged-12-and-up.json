That is why we are giving teenagers the chance to be vaccinated, so we can get more children back into face-to-face education."

That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested billions of pounds in tutoring programmes, extracurricular activities, and further teacher training. We need to use all the tools we have to ensure that every child is in school and fulfilling their potential. Vaccination is key to achieving this."

But let\u2019s be clear: being vaccinated is a good thing, for you and for those around you. It makes you less likely to catch the virus, less likely to pass it on, and far less likely to get seriously ill."
