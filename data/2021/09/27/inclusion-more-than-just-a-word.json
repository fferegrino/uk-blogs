Being on the autistic spectrum means I have a lifelong condition that affects how I make sense of the world, how I process information and how I relate to other people. It is often described as a spectrum because it affects people in many ways, to varying degrees."

Some may be over or under sensitive to any of the senses. All of which can sometimes make it hard for me, and others like me, to feel included."

The Civil Service is proud to say it focuses on the ability rather than the disability of a person."

I even got to stay in Defra for an extra month thanks to my line manager being so supportive and helpful in arranging an extension for me!"

The placement has taught me workplace skills and helped me understand more about what I want and what I don\u2019t particularly want from my future career."
