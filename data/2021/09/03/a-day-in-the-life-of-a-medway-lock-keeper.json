The Environment Agency is the Navigation Authority for 19 miles of inland navigation between Allington Lock and Tonbridge. We have asked him some questions about life as a lock keeper based at Allington Lock."

            "text": "After joining the navigation team as an officer 20 years ago, I fancied a change. I didn\u2019t want to move onwards or upwards and I liked the idea of working on one site permanently so I applied for the lock keeper job. It\u2019s a really nice job and I get on very well with the other lock keeper, Steve. I like being outdoors as I am a practical, outdoors person, so I thought this job would be a good fit. I do my fair share of paperwork, looking at boat registrations, for example."

These can vary day-to-day from routine maintenance around the site, such as mowing, to assisting customers with opening and closing of the lock and answering public queries. We try to keep a tidy and attractive site at all times."

            "text": "We have a high tide twice a day, and the lock operates two hours either side of the tide during the day. We have to keep an eye out for boats which may want to come through the lock at any time. I mentioned that I also complete paperwork - this includes checking and selling boat registrations, which all boats must have. Steve and I are usually the first port of call for a lot of people as one of us is on site 24/7. We work in a shift pattern for two days on and two days off, and during those days we do not leave Allington. Even when we may be called out to a boat rescue someone will need to stay on site at all times, whether it\u2019s myself or another member of the team, because someone needs to be there to manage the locks."

            "text": "During the summer months we are very busy as Allington is a public site with the pub and cafe attracting a lot of customers and we usually get a lot of questions from the public. We also have a slipway which can be very busy with paddle boarders, canoeists and boaters, especially with the influx since lockdown lifted. The site has permanent moorings and a campsite and we have to be available if anyone has any questions. We\u2019ve recently been undergoing capital works to the lock, and we\u2019ve had lots of contractors on site and queries from the public about the works."

The queries range from general ones regarding the lock and questions from river users, to queries from concerned boaters during a strong stream event in the winter. We offer advice and explain what is going on, and we will try to assist as much as we can over the phone."

I like to be busy, so it is nice that I can sort of be my own boss a lot of the time. During lockdown we have been able to build a nice community with the general public and the people who are permanently moored at the lock. We try to help out where we can. Having the added bonus of the coffee shop means the area is busy with people creating a really nice atmosphere. We are also finding that there has been an increase of visitors to the river since lockdown restrictions lifted, as it\u2019s a real boost for their mental health and wellbeing."

There has been an increase in anti-social behaviour along the river, but due to Allington Lock being manned all the time we are able to move people on in most instances. At some of our popular sites, such as Teston and East Farleigh, the litter and anti-social behaviour has been very hard to manage. With people not having places to go when restrictions were in place, the river has been a popular destination to head for and we\u2019ve had thousands of visitors over the past 18 months."
