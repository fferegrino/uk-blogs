These include petro-chemical plants, refineries, large distribution warehouses, satellite communication sites, heritage attractions, quarries, airports and port sites to name a few \u2013 some of which have already been covered in previous blogs."

            "text": "Despite some disastrous early results using hydrogen in airships, it is still a popular choice for the fuel industry and its popularity is on the increase. Hydrogen is an emerging fuel technology with potential to replace battery powered electric cars, plus it\u2019s an abundant element and it\u2019s free. In fact, there are estimates that the running costs of hydrogen and electric will be equal within the next few years."

            "text": "As a whole, the fuel industry is evolving rapidly to tackle resourcing issues and climate change. This has led to significant funding and investment in increased hydrogen use and development of hydrogen production and research facilities. The government has also provided funding for projects looking at using hydrogen and wind as green sources of electricity."

            "text": "Unlike a tank at a petrol filling station, this site actual produces the hydrogen on demand for sale as vehicles fill up. However, the amount being held on site must be limited as it\u2019s an explosive compound, dangerous in higher volumes. Some sites use solar power to supply green energy to the site, creating another element to consider when inspecting."

            "text": "Inspecting a property like this involves following the production process around the site, noting characteristics such as where the supply of electricity comes from (solar, mains or generator) to the type of walls used. This is important as proximity to buildings may mean the walling is actually a blast wall, with extensive protective foundations, and therefore a greater design and building cost must be taken into account for the valuation."

This keeps us on our toes and makes sure our work is always interesting as we manoeuvre our way through a growing modern world. Thankfully we tend to enjoy not knowing what\u2019s coming our way on the horizon!"
