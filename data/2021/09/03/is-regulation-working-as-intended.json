This requires an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan which sets out the evidence to be gathered to support the PIR. IAs should already contain plans for M&E, but at present over 1 in 5 IAs that we have reviewed have \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019 M&E plans. We are currently unable to \u2018red rate\u2019 IAs on inadequate M&E plans (but do provide comments on them in our opinion). One way to improve the quality of evidence underpinning PIRs would be to allow opinions explicity to \u2018red rate\u2019 the IA\u2019s M&E plans."
