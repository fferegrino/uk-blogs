This guide is for river and coastal managers worldwide \u2013 to inspire them, showcasing nature-based approaches to flood and coastal management."

Working closely with our peers at USACE and Rijkswaterstaat we have co-authored chapters on rivers, coasts and community engagement \u2013 sharing our science, knowledge and case studies from across the UK. Here we reflect on some of the innovative solutions being taken forward and the benefits of working with our international partners."

They are an important tool which helps reduce flooding and coastal erosions risks whilst providing a wide range of co-benefits for people and wildlife. The right solution in the right place can improve water quality, stop soil erosion, increase biodiversity and improve habitats."

The Eddleston Water (Scotland) project showcases a wide range of NFM measures in a rural setting. Flood modelling shows that different NFM measures will reduce peak flows and delay flood peaks - providing \u00a32.85 million of avoided flood damages."
