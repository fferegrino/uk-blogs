The culture process takes some time as the bTB bacterium grows slowly. It requires special expertise and safety facilities, which means that culture can only be carried out in specialist laboratories, and it is not always successful even in lab conditions. \u00a0\u00a0It is only after growth in the laboratory that the species of Mycobacterium isolated can be identified."
