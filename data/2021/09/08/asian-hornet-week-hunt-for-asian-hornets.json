Last year Asian Hornet Week coincided with a finding of Asian hornets, which you can read about here: The Threat of Asian Hornet."

Thankfully, Meg and the team were all reasonably fit."

            "text": "Given the terrain and the number of potential points of entry, establishing the location of sightings and setting up traps to be monitored was the first priority for the team. Ultimately the team found and destroyed two nests in Fowey\u2013 a primary and secondary nest, both linked by genetic analysis to the same queen."

Our approach to the Asian hornet is to find and destroy nests before they release potentially hundreds of queens at the end of the summer, each of which has the potential to start a new nest the following year after a period of hibernation."

They are also not averse to hitching a lift on a boat, in a caravan or ferry. Therefore, if you are travelling from mainland Europe, remember to keep a look out in your vehicle or luggage for an unwelcome stowaway! Find out how to report Asian hornet sightings later in this blog."
