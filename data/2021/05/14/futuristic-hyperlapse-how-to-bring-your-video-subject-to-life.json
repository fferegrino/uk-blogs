        {
            "text": "As well as being the ideal medium for showing off the scale of the murals, the hyperlapse uses movement over much longer distances, meaning I could also show the viewer the context and setting in which they\u2019re based."

            "text": "To film a hyperlapse you need a location which has plenty of space, as you will need to move around to capture the motion and transitions. Before shooting, I always walk or make the move I\u2019m planning on capturing so I can get a sense of how far to move between each photo."
        },
        {
            "text": "When it comes to movement, hyperlapses are very versatile. It\u2019s important to choose a motion before beginning to film. Moving towards the subject, moving away and moving around are the most common motions."
        },
        {
            "text": "Before I start to take photos, I look at my subject and find a focal point. When shooting the Brixton murals, I mainly focused on the eyes, but if you are focusing on a building, the edge might be best or anything else that stands out."
        },
        {
            "text": "Since this technique involves moving a lot, the focal point is really important in making the images look stable and consistent. Whatever you do, you need to make sure your focal point is always held in one position, no matter where you move!"

            "text": "I take another step, align the mural on my grid display, and take another photo. The amount of photos I need to take depends on the distance I need to cover, and it varies from shoot to shoot. If my subject is far away, I could take one photo every few steps. If it\u2019s nearby, I could take a photo every time I take a step. For this project, I took between 60 and 90 shots per mural, which added up to around 1,000 pictures!"
