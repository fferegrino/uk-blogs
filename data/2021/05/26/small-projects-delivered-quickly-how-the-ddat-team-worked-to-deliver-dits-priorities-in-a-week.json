This is like a \u2018hackathon\u2019, or what some companies call 10 or 20% Time."

Working remotely has taken away some of the spontaneity of this, but teams are formed over Microsoft Teams, chatting in message threads, and sharing ideas in a dedicated channel."

            "text": "We feel firebreaks help to promote learning new skills and seeing new ways of working. The week does this by encouraging colleagues to work on different workstreams and providing an opportunity to work outside of their usual teams. This deepens the capability we have in our DDaT function, whilst also allowing individuals to try new topics and tools. We found that this was a big hit with all our colleagues who had joined the team working remotely. Andrei Pirogov, User Interface Designer, shares:"

A particularly impactful (and popular) project involved creating a proof of concept for a system to manage HR and recruitment approvals. By using open source tools, and reusable components, including the GOV.UK design system and prototype kit, small teams were able to quickly show what such a product might look like."

For example, we improved the speed and coverage of our automated testing, allowing us to quickly deploy new releases with less manual effort. Other ideas have proven to be useful and will warrant further exploration. Finally, some areas have been explored, and we can safely say \u201cnow isn\u2019t the time\u201d."

This will allow us to expand to include more teams, incorporate more diverse skills and ultimately deliver projects with greater value to our users."
