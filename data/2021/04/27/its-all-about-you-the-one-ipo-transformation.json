            "text": "Intellectual Property (IP) is essential to making the UK the most innovative and creative country in the world. It is fuel to unleash innovation and creativity; to help British businesses build back better and build back greener following the pandemic. The UK already has a world leading IP environment, but a service for innovators must itself innovate."

        },
        {
            "text": "IP matters. It\u2019s increasingly relevant in a world where content, ideas and brands are king. Industries with an above average use of IP account for over 40% of UK GDP, 15.5% (4.5 million) of total UK employment and 52.1% (\u00a3159.7 billion) of goods exported. Needless to say, that\u2019s a lot of money and a lot of jobs!"
        },
        {
            "text": "Aside from the hard numbers, we see the value that businesses and investors place in IP all around us. Why did Disney acquire Fox? It wasn\u2019t for their brick-and-mortar assets; it was for their IP. Closer to home, what is one of the first questions that investors ask on Dragon\u2019s Den? \"Do you have a patent for that?\". Today, the real bulk of a business\u2019s value is in its IP."
        },
        {
            "text": "So, IP being important for businesses, means it is important for the UK economy. In a post-Brexit world, the UK has to carve out new opportunities to have a competitive edge in the face of fierce global competition. Having a truly world-leading IP environment can help set the UK apart and attract investors. If the UK provides unique support to businesses to not only register and protect their IP, but to use, monetise and innovate through IP, the UK will gain a competitive edge. That\u2019s where the IPO comes in."

            "text": "When we first started thinking about how the IPO should transform, and how we would take it forward, we were clear that the expectations of our customers had changed. It\u2019s not enough just to say we\u2019ll \u2018digitise\u2019 what we\u2019re already doing. When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, they weren\u2019t trying to make a better iPod, they were trying to make a new type of device that made the most out of mobile internet services. Similarly, we want to make the most of modern technology to redefine what our services can be in the future."

            "text": "Over the next 5 years, we don\u2019t want to just modernise and recreate our current processes, systems and services. We want to\u202fcompletely transform what we do, the way we do it and the value we contribute to\u00a0the UK\u00a0economy."
        },
        {
            "text": "In the short to medium term, that means creating a one stop shop for IP. Right now, if somebody wants to get a patent they have to use a completely different system from the one they would for, say, a trade mark. This makes simple tasks unnecessarily difficult for our customers. For example, at the moment if somebody wants to change their business address, they have to tell us that information for each separate patent, trade mark or design they have registered. In future they will be able to change this information themselves, one time in one place. We want to bring all our core services under one roof, and that includes empowering researchers to make better use of our IP data."
