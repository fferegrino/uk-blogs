Specifically this is about acknowledging the wider context of how people interact with the Service Manual and Service Standard. Understanding how these artefacts make a difference to users (on a day-to-day basis) means that we can ensure guidance stays relevant and useful."

How did the manual (and adhering to the standard) support them with everyday practice in the context of their role and remit?"

            "text": "The crux of the approach is about comparing teams who use the Service Manual and consult the Standard against those who do not. Over a set length of time, you could measure the time taken between a service assessment and the service going live, the productivity of new starters, comparing between services who failed on user needs related points in spend controls and service assessments and then revisited their approach.\u00a0"
