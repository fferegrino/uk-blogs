My answer has always been \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need the flu vaccine, I\u2019m not a sickly person, I never get ill. I have a good immune system.\u201d I then decided to read up on flu and why I should have the vaccine."

            "text": "I may not get poorly very often, but the environment in which I work means there are many people who could get very ill or die if they caught the flu. I suddenly felt very selfish and very shocked at the potential dangers I could be putting another person in."
