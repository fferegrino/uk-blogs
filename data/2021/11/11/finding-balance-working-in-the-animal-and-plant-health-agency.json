            "text": "You\u2019ll find it on most job adverts these days: work-life balance, it is so important and yet, for many it would seem, it can be difficult to achieve. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in my veterinary career to date, I\u2019ve had variety upon variety, and I continue to enjoy my work and the balance it affords me."

            "text": "Many years ago, I would have been the one questioning working as a vet in government. What would I be doing? Would I get the stimulus I\u2019d had in practice? Yet here I am, years later with skills and experiences that I could only have gained from working first in the State Veterinary Service and now the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)."

        {
            "text": "That balance I mentioned, well that has meant I have not only continued to work in practice part-time (companion animals), I have also agreed working hours that fits around my needs and, more importantly, the ferrying needs of my two sons."

        {
            "text": "I enjoy, although I am less inclined to think at the time, taking part in races and events that aren\u2019t always what most would consider normal. Less park runs and more sleeping in a tent out in the middle of nowhere midway through a cycle race. With the temperature being a chilly -5c outside."

            "text": "Not that long ago I took part in the highest mountain bike race in the world. Eight days of cycling in the Himalayas with almost unimaginable scenery and at literally breathtaking altitude. There was of course a lot of cycling, plenty of lentil curry and hours spent trying to describe to everyone and anyone where Wales is."

Working in APHA, with the approach to flexible working and leave, meant that I could not only train in preparation for the event, but also take over two weeks off to visit one of the most magical and inspiring sites in the world."

            "text": "In May of this year APHA launched the vet recruitment microsite. The new advert is a great addition in publishing the range of roles as well as capturing the benefits of working as a vet for APHA. There are details on the site about our recruitment process, a list of current vacancies and even an opportunity to register your interest. There is also an intention to add some short videos soon, providing even more insight into how life working in APHA may look for you."

From safeguarding animal welfare, controlling borders to surveillance and responding to notifiable diseases, to name only a few areas."
