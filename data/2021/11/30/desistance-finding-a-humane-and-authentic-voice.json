Clarity and simplicity are essential in overcoming this, but so are openness and humanity."

Desistance is how to understand people\u2019s thinking and behaviour and help them move themselves towards a happier and more productive life."

Olivia is also the subject matter expert for the Assess Risks and Needs team. It was a fascinating talk and Olivia went a step further with a short role-play where a member of the content team volunteered to be interviewed.\u00a0"

The fundamental shift in emphasis was striking. It brought home to us that everyone thinks and feels and deserves to be treated with empathy."

            "text": "We know, for example, that excessively formal language is depersonalised and often uses the passive voice, which positions the individual as a subject to whom things happen. An active voice is clearer and easier to understand. It speaks directly to the listener and implies agency and equality.\u00a0"

            "text": "In desistance theory and practice these things are important. \u2018Offenders\u2019 are understood as individuals who want pretty much what everyone wants, but have counter-productive methods for achieving their goals. Shouting at them through physical and emotional barriers and telling them they are wrong is not going to help. If we want people to act and think the way we do, we have to include them in our community of thought. Desistance is therefore about building genuine relationships. Its language demonstrates care about the supervisee, and avoids terms that imply control, monitoring and surveillance."

It\u2019s now \u2018person on probation\u2019. In our digital services, we are going further and using the names of people wherever possible."

A person \u2018stays in their room\u2019 or \u2018avoids others\u2019 rather than being called a \u2018self-isolator\u2019. Individuals are not let out for \u2018association\u2019 but to have \u2018social time\u2019. Unhelpful labels are starting to be replaced."
