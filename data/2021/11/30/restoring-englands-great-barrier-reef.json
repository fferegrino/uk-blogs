            "text": "On 15 October 2021, the Chalk Streams Restoration Group marked a major milestone on the journey to restore England\u2019s chalk streams. The group was formed in 2020 to bring together many partners responsible for or interested in the future of these precious habitats. The resulting Chalk Stream Restoration Strategy, which we launched on 15 October, sets us on course to breathe life back into a part of our environment that so desperately needs it."

            "text": "Why do we need to restore chalk streams - what makes them so special? Chalk streams are an exceptional type of spring-fed river distinct to England and parts of France and Denmark. Although chalk exists in other parts of the world, nowhere else do we find these clear-watered rivers. In England, they are distributed across an arc of chalk that runs from Dorset to Yorkshire. Chalk streams \u2013 in their natural condition \u2013 are home to a profusion of life. When rain falls on chalk hills most of it soaks down into the body of the rock and there undergoes a kind of alchemy, emerging from springs as cool, alkaline, mineral-rich water, providing the perfect properties to create a richly diverse eco-system.\u00a0 Botanically, chalk streams are the most biodiverse of all English rivers. For invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals, they offer a vast range of habitat niches. They are our equivalent of the Great Barrier Reef, or the Okavango Delta: a truly special natural heritage and a responsibility."

            "text": "But chalk streams are under immense pressure. They flow through one of the most urbanised, industrialised and populated parts of the UK. Three chalk streams flow through London, and there are many more in the chalk hills that surround the capital. Further afield, though many flow through more open countryside, that countryside is busily farmed, while villages or towns are sited somewhere along most chalk rivers. All these streams are impacted in one way or another by the activities of people."

            "text": "We depend on chalk streams for public water supply, and have leant heavily \u2013 in some places, very heavily \u2013 on the resources of the underground body of water that feeds these streams. And yet every litre of water we take out of the aquifers \u2013 and we take billions and billions of litres to irrigate our crops, or run our taps \u2013 is water lost to the natural environment. At least until we put it back."
