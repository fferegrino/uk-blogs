We are glad to be seeing what\u2019s happening for children, having conversations with teachers, and building on what we learned through our visits last year. We recognise the huge efforts being made to give pupils and learners the education and support they need through the pandemic."

            "text": "And, as I\u2019ve said before, we do recognise that this isn\u2019t business as usual. The impact of the pandemic will vary depending on the circumstances of each school. So, we\u2019ve made some further changes to our deferral policy to reflect how deferral requests are being dealt with in practice. As you would expect, we are considering decisions carefully on a case-by-case basis, based on the particular issues that individual schools are facing. We fully appreciate the challenges, and most deferrals are being granted. We\u2019ll be publishing our revised policy soon."

Understandably, schools want to know how they\u2019ll be affected, so this post sets out what the change means in practice."

            "text": "Before the pandemic, most good schools were usually inspected once every 4 years. Because of lockdowns and restrictions, routine inspections were put on hold for 18 months and we said it would take us until summer 2026 to get round all schools (including previously exempt outstanding schools) once we restarted. This meant that a typical good-rated school was likely to be inspected 5 or 6 terms later than it would have been."
        },
        {
            "text": "The new funding means that we can bring this forward slightly. Including last term\u2019s inspections, we\u2019re now aiming to get to every school once by the summer of 2025. This isn\u2019t a radical change, but it will provide more timely assurance that they are on the right track. We\u2019ll start gradually increasing the number of inspections we carry out from next September \u2013 so we will get to more schools as the inspection period progresses. This means that a typical good-rated school inspected just before the pandemic is likely to be inspected 1 year later than it might normally expect, rather than 2."

In time, this will mean that schools can expect an inspection only 3-4 terms later (so around 5 years after their last inspection)."

Now, these schools can expect an inspection approximately 5 to 6 terms later than they would have done. Because the inspection intervals are shorter for requires improvement and inadequate schools, we were already on track to reinspect these schools much sooner (and have already inspected many of them) \u2013 so the changes are unlikely to affect many of these schools."

Everyone working in education needs to play their part in giving this cohort of children the best education possible. Inspecting schools more quickly means we can provide those insights about recovery sooner, rather than later. That\u2019s good for schools \u2013 who want to know their plans are on track. But most importantly, it\u2019s the right thing for children."
