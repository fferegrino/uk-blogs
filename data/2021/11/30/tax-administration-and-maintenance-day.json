The government has decided not to introduce the professional indemnity insurance requirement at this time, but to consult in 2022 on options to improve\u202fthe wider regulatory framework around standards in tax advice. The government will also be consulting on proposals to tackle the high cost to taxpayers of using tax agents to claim tax repayments. Linked to this we have also published the findings of an externally commissioned research study into characteristics of unaffiliated tax agents. This study aimed to provide HMRC with in-depth insight into the behaviours and attitudes of agents who were not members of a professional body."

The call for evidence also seeks views on HMRC\u2019s approach to the small minority of business taxpayers who do not engage with HMRC and hold off paying their tax for as long as they can, forcing HMRC to resort to costly and time-consuming enforcement action. The proposals will not affect taxpayers who are in temporary financial difficulty and need support from HMRC to get back onto a sustainable financial footing \u2013 including those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic."
