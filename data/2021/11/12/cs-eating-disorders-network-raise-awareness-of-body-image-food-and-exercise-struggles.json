But for others, our relationship to our bodies, food and exercise can be complex or unhappy experiences.\u00a0In a 2019 report, one in five people had felt shame\u00a0and over one in three had felt \u2018down or low\u2019 due to their body image in that year."

However, we don\u2019t often speak about these thoughts and feelings with each other, and for some, this silence can conceal fear, shame and stigma. For those who suffer from eating disorders and related issues, these thoughts and feelings can take over your life and are complex mental illnesses which can be difficult to manage."

Eating disorders are severe mental illnesses and can have a significant impact not only on the sufferer, but those who care for them including parents, siblings, friends, and colleagues."

As well as providing direct support, we produce toolkits for departments which provide guidance and signpost resources, as well as running civil service-wide events to break the stigma around these issues and encourage a more inclusive workplace."

            "text": "FACT: Eating disorders are complex mental illnesses \u2013 there is no single cause. Instead they are thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Eating disorders are extremely distressing for both the individual and their loved ones, and often are accompanied by feelings of shame. They require specialist treatment, but people can and do get better. Eating disorders are mental health disorders and are never a personal choice, they take many different forms and can affect anyone regardless of age, socio-economic background, ethnicity, gender or sexuality."
