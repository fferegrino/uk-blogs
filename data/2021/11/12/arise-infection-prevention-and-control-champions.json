More than that, they have motivated and inspired others to do the same, making a huge difference in the lives of those they care for. That\u2019s why I am delighted to launch the IPC Champions Network, to maximise, celebrate and share best practice across care settings throughout the sector."

Through an initially online platform, they will share best practice, using a series of virtual meetings, newsletters and a discussion forum, all hosted by the Queen\u2019s Nursing Institute. This will be shared to make sure a sustained focus on IPC continues beyond the pandemic."

We need to support these colleagues to share their work and come together to inspire others across the country. The network will be an important element in how we deal with the challenges of the winter months, including seasonal infections, whilst maintaining the continued pandemic response."
