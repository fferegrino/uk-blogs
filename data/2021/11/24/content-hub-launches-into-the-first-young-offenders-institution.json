Distraction ('pull') content draws residents in (music, workouts, books, chess) while 'push' content (lived experience stories, 24/7 mental health support, videos and podcasts, mindfulness, yoga, education and rehabilitation content) helps to create new pathways in the brain which can support real change."

We needed to push rehabilitative information across while alleviating boredom and raising mood. It's a delicate balance. If the Content Hub was a simple government information tool, or too authoritarian, it might well get discarded. But if it's more like a mobile phone, with things to read, do, apps to help with banking and canteen, photos of family, it becomes more personal and precious to the boys, therefore not something they would want to break in a fit of anger or rage."

When they leave daily comments telling us what they need, we're reminded every day who our users are, and can respond. Not only does this make the Hub better, content-wise, again it gives the boys a sense of agency and that their views matter. That they matter."
