Many people deal with their own case without legal support, which can add to the stress of the situation. There\u2019s a human story behind every hearing."

We\u2019ve already made some changes and have more improvements planned. In October 2021, Engine, the supplier we worked with to create our online immigration and asylum appeal service, won an industry award from The Service Design Network. The award recognises the detailed work and innovative approach involved in transforming the service."

There are many different types \u2013 for instance, they may deal with workplace disputes between employers and employees, or rule on appeals against decisions made by Government departments (including on social security benefits, immigration and asylum, and tax credits)."

In some cases, a tribunal decision can provide resolution when all other attempts to reach agreement have proved impossible. So it\u2019s important that the processes and systems we are responsible for are easy for people to access and use."

Even before COVID-19, our tribunals services were evolving from paper-based, complicated systems that were not designed around the people using them. Many tribunal areas now operate using accessible digital services that are easy to use and save time and resources. The end result is a better service for all involved."

Maintaining the safety of our tribunal users has been their priority. Everyone has worked so hard, adapting processes and keeping the system operating throughout this worrying time. I am grateful for everyone\u2019s contribution."

The changes will increase the number of times a patient can apply to the tribunal during the first six months of being detained under the Act. The changes also introduce an increase in the number of automatic referrals that are made to the tribunal for patients who do not make their own applications. This will help ensure that no one is left in long-term care without an independent review of the need to detain them."
