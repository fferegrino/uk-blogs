Environmental impacts, of one description or another, often appear prominently in our work. The Planning Inspectorate has an important role in ensuring impacts are fully considered in the planning of new places. The recent enactment of the\u00a0Environment Act brings the power to set new legally binding standards on air quality and restoring natural habitats among other important changes. Much of the detail will appear in secondary legislation, so we will be keeping our Inspectors and environmental professionals up to date to ensure they can continue to be well-placed to deliver our services effectively according to relevant policy and legislation.\u00a0"
