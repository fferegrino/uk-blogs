            "text": "I have been involved in launching networks in the North East before, but this would be the first national network for us. By applying a model that has proved to be successful over 12 local authority areas this new challenge would see it being tested nationally. The core principles, however, would remain the same: a grassroots, peer-led network for members to connect, upskill and influence through sharing experiences and best practices, while working to drive and deliver change for the benefit of the sector."

            "text": "The scoping work done by the Department for Education prior to launch had shown there was a need and desire for school business professionals (SBPs) working in the special and alternative provision sector to have their own voice and have their unique challenges recognised.\u00a0 Jo Marchant was one of the SBPs who lobbied the DfE to set up the network playing a key part in the first 12 months and now feels part of a community that didn\u2019t exist before."

The support from the DfE was fantastic but when we heard that Boris Johnson was making a special announcement on 23rd March, we knew it was not going to be the launch of The National Network of Special Schools for School Business Professionals (NNoSS). Instead, the country was plunged into lockdown."

            "text": "The need for school business professional peer support is well known and this only grew during the pandemic. Suddenly schools became the \u2018fourth emergency service\u2019 not only ensuring their provision continued but supporting families and communities more than ever.\u00a0 Much of this fell on SBPs working on the front line and I was, more than once, moved to tears seeing the commitment and dedication they demonstrated to protect colleagues, families and students alike."

These were always going to play a part in the development of NNoSS, and fortunately, we were in a position to quickly revisit plans to push ahead, ensuring that the required support was there in the virtual world."
