            "text": "In June 2020 I received an email from my APHA colleagues in the Surveillance and Laboratory Services Department (SLSD) about a positive Brucella canis blood test result, the scale of which I had never seen before. I checked the submission form and saw that it described an imported dog that had recently aborted. There have previously been less than a handful of confirmed cases of B. canis in GB, but this looked like the real deal and rang alarm bells."

        {
            "text": "B. canis is a zoonotic bacterium (meaning that it can cause disease in humans) and is listed with other Brucella species as a biohazard category 3 human pathogen. Abortion material from infected animals contains very high numbers of infectious B. canis cells and contact with this is one of the main ways in which both dogs and humans can acquire infection. So, there was ample scope for concern."
        },
        {
            "text": "The preferred host of B. canis is dogs and it causes the disease canine brucellosis. Other species of Brucella also have preferred hosts, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, seals and whales, although most can also infect people. The Brucella species we have historically been most concerned about are those infecting livestock due to the production losses that result and the threat to public health."

            "text": "Globally it is estimated that between three million and 12.5 million people a year contract brucellosis from animals, almost exclusively livestock. GB is free from brucellosis in livestock and wildlife and, until recently, it was also not found in dogs."
        },
        {
            "text": "As with other animals (but not humans) the disease in dogs causes abortions although some pregnancies can be successful. Infected dogs also frequently acquire other clinical signs - most often chronic and debilitating back and rear limb pain. However, some may appear visibly well yet can still be infectious and may go on to develop disease. Unfortunately, unlike in humans, the disease is not considered curable in dogs."

They engage in cases with potential zoonotic ramifications and regularly interact with a network of contacts working in public health. They, without delay, informed the Zoonoses team at Public Health England (PHE), now the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), as the case occurred in England. PHE engaged their colleagues from the local Health Protection Team (HPT) and clinicians with specialist knowledge of human brucellosis from the Brucella Reference Unit based at Liverpool University Hospitals."

            "text": "As human-to-human infection is thought to be extremely unlikely, understanding dog-to-dog transmission pathways, including the role of environmental contamination, was critical to not only safeguarding animal health, but also human health. These judgements could only be made with the pooled knowledge of the assembled multi-agency team of veterinarians, clinicians, epidemiologists, bacteriologists and disease specialists."

This includes better tools for detection, a better understanding of disease transmission and the virulence of B. canis for humans."
