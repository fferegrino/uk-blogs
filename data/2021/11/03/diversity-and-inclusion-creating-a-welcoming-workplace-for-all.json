I\u2019ll just be glad when it\u2019s over!\u201d\u00a0 Predictably though, she was right.\u00a0 The interest, attendance, amazing guest speakers and positive feedback we received from delegates blew us away.\u00a0 But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 see for yourselves with some feedback from our senior Civil Servant day \u2026\u2026.."
