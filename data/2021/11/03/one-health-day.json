Without a full understanding of our changing interactions with animals and our environment, we will increase the risk of threats to human, animal, plant and environmental health."

            "text": "This is why I firmly believe it is critical to embed and sustain a One Health approach, which understands and incorporates this interconnectedness, throughout government, the public, the scientific community and with international partners. This is imperative if we are to avoid further public health crises from infectious diseases that originate in animals, so-called zoonoses, to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), prevent food insecurity and mitigate impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss."

            "text": "COP26 presents another global opportunity to reflect on our relationship with nature, a critical facet to protecting our health resilience. Here again, the One Health approach offers great insights, and a robust framework to defend against the increasing threats from climate change and environmental degradation, such as the geographical spread of important biological vectors of diseases, such as mosquitoes, ticks, midges and sandflies, due to expansion of their geographic ranges. Biodiversity loss, land use (including agriculture) and pollution also play critical roles and we must be aware of their impact on zoonotic risk and the ecosystems we are so dependent on for our health."

            "text": "Our UK G7 Presidency contributed significantly to global One Health developments, setting up three new initiatives. The One Health Intelligence Scoping Study led by the Tripartite and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has now launched, aiming to improve global health resilience and early warning through building and integration of our health intelligence systems that are so fundamental to threat mitigation."

Developing science capability, The UK Animal Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre was established to accelerate vaccine delivery for livestock diseases."

This builds on existing cross-Whitehall engagement, such as the COVID-19 response where experts from the animal sector provided expert laboratory and scientific modelling capability."

            "text": "The Human Animal Infections & Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group, also remains an exemplar of One Health in action. We should strive to pursue domain-less approaches to avoid narrow problem-solving and build stronger, more holistic policy for all our global life support systems (e.g., water, energy, food and shelter)."
        },
        {
            "text": "Having a cross- Whitehall agreed One Health definition, as well as a clear animal, plant and environmental focus in the Government\u2019s Integrated Review and related cross-disciplinary groups, helps to formalise this collaboration. These provide strong platforms for a truly embedded One Health approach. We want to drive further step changes in the way we work, with fully equitable engagement across the spectrum of human, animal, plant and environmental sectors, to provide us with greater health resilience and more holistic, sustainable policies and practices."

We are of course not alone here, and I have been pleased to see UNEP join forces with the Tripartite to consolidate the groups environmental offering, as well as the establishment of the One Health High Level Expert Panel that will provide greater guidance and cooperation on One Health issues. I look forward to working with global partners to build on this, so we are better prepared for future threats."
