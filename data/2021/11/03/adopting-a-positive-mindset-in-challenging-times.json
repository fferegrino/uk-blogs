            "text": "I was inspired to write this blog post when I took some time to think about how the lockdown\u2019s impacted my wellbeing, what I learned and ways I managed to keep positive. I\u2019m also part of the internal Digital Voices programme, which supports women to build their confidence and skills. So I felt sharing my experience on stress \u2013 which can be a taboo subject \u2013 would be a positive thing to do. I\u2019ve experienced a number of depression/anxiety episodes over the years and have learned to look out for the signs which tend to be triggered by major events that feel out of my control. The first was in 2000 when I broke my spine. The second was in 2005 when we had a house fire, my boys were both under two at the time, and we had to move into rented accommodation. The third was when I returned to work in 2011 after having my youngest and the last was in 2015 when I was on the road delivering training. If you ignore the fact that they seem to happen every five years, they all happened when an event occurred that I had no control over."

When you stay in one environment you start to see more of the bad than the good and I\u2019ll confess I had a few wobbles along the way, but found strategies that have made me feel better."

Even though we sort of knew that it was coming, it\u2019s only when you see the restrictions in black and white that things become very real.

Deciding not to let that stop us, I came up with an idea for an online party. I created party packs for each of her friends from boxes filled with party food, games, prizes and treats that were all individually wrapped and I invited all the children onto a Zoom call so they could open everything together. Who says work skills aren\u2019t transferable to home life?"

            "text": "Although it wasn\u2019t the same as being together in person, we still made fabulous memories that would never have happened without the pandemic. The party was so successful that I ran a Friday night online bingo session, in the run up to Christmas, for her classmates. I\u2019m so proud that my daughter is now an expert at organising online calls, which I think is a great skill to learn in this digital age."

I was not taking the risk of celebrating at a venue. Therefore, to keep an element of control, I planned it at home. I spent months looking for deals on gazebos, fairy lights and decorations. I kept a close eye on the numbers to be invited just in case restrictions were not lifted, which they weren\u2019t. I thought I had planned for everything until I got a call five days before the party saying the caterer had COVID-19. Instead of panicking I recruited my mum and best friend to help me recreate the menu, after all we were now restricted to a maximum of 30 guests. In the end everything went well and my son ended up with two parties, the first with family and a small number of mates and a second with just friends. Though I drew the line at catering for two parties, so the second just had drinks and nibbles."
