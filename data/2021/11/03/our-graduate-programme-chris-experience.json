I didn\u2019t really know a huge amount about tax or HMRC when I applied or when I started, so definitely don\u2019t let that put you off if you\u2019re thinking of applying!"

            "text": "I thought HMRC would be a good match given I studied Maths at university but in hindsight that didn\u2019t really matter and my colleagues on the course were from a range of backgrounds. The course provided a good mixture of academic and practical learning, and you are given the chance to apply the learning in your work. Overall, the programme is quite flexible, and you are trusted to manage your own learning. The classes were also a great chance to get to know your colleagues better and to meet people from a variety of different teams. It was a great transition from university to work life."

            "text": "I started my HMRC career in the Large Business team and really enjoyed doing compliance work with a range of HMRC\u2019s customers. The main focus of our compliance teams is to make sure businesses are fully tax compliant. I could lead my own enquiries into small businesses \u2013 corresponding with customers directly and leading my own cases. This allowed me to get to grips with the basics of tax."

        {
            "text": "I was also included as part of wider teams working with more experienced colleagues on some of the most complex customers within the financial sector. I can remember one day that really stood out for me where I spent the morning at a sole trader\u2019s house, sitting on their sofa going through records with them with their dog sat on my lap, followed by a slightly more glamorous afternoon in the 40th floor of a skyscraper in Canary Wharf. I think the TSP is one of the few graduate schemes that would offer that range of experiences!"

            "text": "I always felt comfortable in my work due to the support network you start with on the programme. Trainees in their second and third years and more senior, experienced colleagues have all been really supportive. I also found that most doors in the organisation were always open for me as a TSP trainee and whenever I asked to get involved with something interesting the answer was usually yes."

The experience and contacts I gained on the TSP have been essential to allow me to continue to progress at HMRC.\u201d"
