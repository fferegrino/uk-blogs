            "text": "To support government to collectively work towards that vision, our team initially compared some of the different forms technologies currently in use. While not a fix-all for every form or every team, online HTML forms emerged as more accessible, easier to use and quicker to process, compared to document-based forms. We hope more government teams using online HTML forms will make it easier for people to use niche, but important government services."

On GOV.UK, most services use document-based forms, such as PDFs, Word documents or OpenDocuments. Higher volume services also use online HTML forms."

            "text": "We did not evaluate forms sent in by post. The volumes of posted forms equate roughly with the 10% of the UK adult population who don\u2019t use the internet. This suggests there is a need to support posted forms rather than replace them entirely, so we didn\u2019t think it was fair to compare posted forms with internet-based technologies, as this group would be unlikely to use them."

        {
            "text": "Document-based forms can currently only meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard, not WCAG 2.1 AA. For example, documents designed to be edited don\u2019t reflow when zoomed in, instead users have to scroll horizontally and vertically which makes things much harder for some users."

            "text": "Even creating document-based forms that meet the lower WCAG 2.0 AA standard requires specialist accessibility skills. While we haven\u2019t conducted a comprehensive audit, we have found very few examples of document-based forms on GOV.UK that meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard."

            "text": "Online HTML forms can meet the higher WCAG 2.1 AA standard, but creating them usually requires a digital team with specialist digital skills. There are many examples of these types of forms on GOV.UK. While there are platforms that use templates to make it easier to create online HTML forms that meet the standard without specialist skills, they are relatively expensive, require a lot of training or lack necessary features."

        {
            "text": "Document-based forms have a few benefits that online HTML forms don\u2019t always have. For example, they can be filled out in whatever order the user prefers and are easily filled out by more than one person. However, they can be difficult to use on all device types, particularly on mobile devices, which make up the majority of users on GOV.UK. We heard from many services that people struggle to fill them in using specialist PDF editors or word processors. Many users resort to printing forms out, filling them in with pen, then scanning or taking photos to attach to an email. For people that don\u2019t have access to a printer, this isn\u2019t an option. Some users just give up."

In addition, online HTML forms are much easier to use on all device types, particularly on mobile devices. Being able to fill in a form in a web browser without downloading and editing a form means people can more easily access government services on their phone on the bus home."

We estimated timings based on the steps involved in processing information collected using forms and used them to help our team prioritise areas to explore. Actual processing times will vary from team to team, and we did not ask other government service teams to verify our estimates at this stage."

Most of the potential time savings come from using validation to check all of the form information is there before someone submits it. Form validation could significantly reduce the amount of time civil servants spend contacting people who didn\u2019t submit the right information."

        {
            "text": "The rest of the potential savings come from collecting the information in ways that are easier to process, such as faster copying and pasting. In the long term, we hope to be able to make this even more efficient by feeding information directly into case management systems."

However, we\u2019re also considering some other factors, not least matters of digital inclusion for example, ensuring document-based forms remain available for people that don\u2019t use the internet."
        },
        {
            "text": "In addition, we estimate that between 20 and 35% of document-based forms on GOV.UK have complex and less common question or answer formats. These formats probably wouldn\u2019t be available in a typical form-building platform, and there might be some that are too complex to use without a digital team. Others might be so specific to one particular service that it would not make sense to have in a common platform."

            "text": "Teams could recreate these features in online HTML forms using a developer to write some bespoke code. However, if they\u2019re a lower volume service and don\u2019t have a developer, they might not be able to use online HTML forms. As a result, we think for some lower volume services, the best way to improve forms may still be to get help from specialists to make document-based forms more accessible."
