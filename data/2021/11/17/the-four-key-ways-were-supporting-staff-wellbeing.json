We\u2019ve found that the charter complements the existing work on wellbeing that we\u2019ve been doing during the pandemic. I\u2019ve worked closely with headteacher, Chris Deller, and the leadership team to ensure staff wellbeing is considered in everything the academy does. This drills down to four main pillars of work:"

They can also join our wellbeing committee, formed of staff from all departments. The committee aims to promote the wellbeing of all employees and meets termly to coordinate wellbeing weeks and inform staff of new initiatives via the monthly wellbeing newsletter. They also evaluate the impact of any interventions we have introduced to improve wellbeing \u2013 such as reducing emails after 6pm or at the weekend \u2013 to ensure they\u2019re effective."

            "text": "We have established a workload group, which is made up of different members of staff each term. The group includes those with a range of experiences, for example staff who have taught in at least one other school; staff who have previously worked outside of teaching and support staff. They identify priorities to support staff in managing workload by using the DFE\u2019s School workload reduction toolkit. The group uses surveys to identify pinch points where workload interventions are needed and to remove any unnecessary burdens. For example, we\u2019ve reduced the stress of lesson observations by using an effective feedback model. This has given way for a new approach, where feedback is practiced away from the lesson before being implemented in teaching practice."

As well as an \u2018expert teacher directory\u2019 to signpost staff to best practice. The academy has also launched a shadowing programme, giving staff the opportunity to broaden their experience and get to know more about their colleagues and the roles they perform. We\u2019ve found this can boost wellbeing and help staff work towards their career goals."
