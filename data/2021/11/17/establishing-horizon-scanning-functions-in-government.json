This workshop was attended by over 100 futures practitioners across central government departments, public bodies and the wider public sector. These participants ranged in experience from experts to newcomers in horizon scanning. Participants were split up into smaller groups to discuss their experiences and the main questions they asked themselves while setting up a function."
