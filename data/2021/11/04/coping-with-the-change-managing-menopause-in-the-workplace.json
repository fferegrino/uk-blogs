This will enable us to make the project delivery community a more inclusive workplace for individuals going through menopause, in turn helping us to build a more supportive and resilient community all round."

It was disconcerting at best and often quite distressing \u2013 particularly as I wasn\u2019t sure what was triggering my moods. After a few weeks where I did a lot of crying in the evenings, I went to the GP to seek help and after some tests it was revealed that I was having an early menopause and I was ultimately prescribed HRT [Hormone Replacement Therapy]. I didn\u2019t intend to have children, but I know this is something that really impacts many women who have an early change."

I started reading up about it as I was approaching that age and then realised that I had been having symptoms for years! I couldn\u2019t sleep, had night sweats, anxiety and brain fog since my mid-40s, which I hadn\u2019t connected to the menopause. I never had hot flushes so I assumed that I was ok. A doctor recently described it to me \u2013 it\u2019s a process, not an event, so the symptoms evolve over time as your hormones change."

I noticed I was waking up feeling sick each morning, a little like morning sickness. I had suffered periods of anxiety \u2013 overthinking things, worrying and feeling emotional over petty things \u2013 and only recognised it when one of my friends asked if I was ok. My initial reaction was, \u201cYes, I am fine,\u201d but it made me realise I wasn\u2019t - I had just internalised it. I have had the occasional hot flush during waking hours and have noticed that sugar and alcohol are usually contributory."

They\u2019re often worse when I am concentrating or when I am feeling stressed. It can happen in big meetings or recently, when I was in a job interview. It was really unpleasant and I felt that people could interpret it as severe nerves and be put off by it."

The bleeding can get heavier and more frequent towards the end. I ended up being severely anaemic and have had to change my diet to manage that.

I ended up working longer hours, as I needed to make notes in advance of every meeting and at the end of the day, as I couldn\u2019t trust myself to remember what I had read, discussed and agreed. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough talking to anyone about it, but my team sometimes had to gently remind me of previous decisions. It also drove my daughters mad, as I would ask them the same questions again and again. I seriously thought I had early onset dementia. I\u2019ve been on HRT for a few months now, and it\u2019s helping."

I felt a huge and quick change in my mental wellbeing and if I feel that I need it in the future, I will weigh up the risks against quality of life. I felt so desperate at the time that I didn\u2019t have much hesitation about taking it to be honest. The issue of menopause is beginning to be well known (I feel anyway) so more and more research about HRT will be available. It\u2019s a very personal choice but I would absolutely take advice from a GP to help with decision making."
