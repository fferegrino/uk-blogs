The CILab will be hosted by Policy Lab and sit alongside our other innovative approaches to policy, expanding the tools available to policymakers to tackle complex challenges and deliver real impact. We have been developing the CILab over the last year alongside working on COVID priorities, creating a vision for the Oxford-Cambridge Arc, improving UN guidance on peacekeeping, and reforming the environmental impact of the 'last mile' of delivery logistics to reduce emissions."

            "text": "Since launching in 2014, Policy Lab has been at the forefront of trialing the use of design thinking, ethnography, digital and data in policymaking. The new CILab builds on the insights from such work, with the emphasis on co-creating policy ideas from large, diverse groups of people, online. It will explore whether collective intelligence tools can help policymakers to co-design better policies with citizens, experts and institutions beyond government that secure high quality outcomes for the UK."

            "text": "Collective intelligence is the shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and collective efforts of many diverse individuals. We know that when diverse groups get involved in policymaking, we are able to identify a greater range of viable solutions. The vTaiwan online discussion platform is a good example of how a government has used collective intelligence tools to resolve emerging policy issues relating, for example, to online alcohol sales, drones and e-bike regulation."

These experiments tested the value of a digital collective intelligence network - where people and computers can be connected so that collectively they act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer can in isolation.\u00a0"
