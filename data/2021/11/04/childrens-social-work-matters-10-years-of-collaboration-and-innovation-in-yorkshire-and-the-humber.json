CSWM is a collaboration of all local authority (LA) children\u2019s services in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Together, their focus is to raise the image of child and family social work, drive recruitment and support the ongoing collaboration and development of practitioners."

It was there I got involved in a PR and marketing workstream to improve the image of child and family social work. It was my role to pull a long-term campaign together to attract more people with the right skills and expertise into the profession. The recruitment landscape was particularly difficult at that point, with a huge reliance on agencies. It felt like there were lots of things stacking up against the profession and preventing it from moving forward."

            "text": "In the early stages of CSWM, it was a challenge bringing professionals together so that we weren\u2019t all grappling with issues in isolation. Due to the level of competition between LAs, many didn\u2019t want to open up about the real challenges they were facing. It took a bit of time to build relationships and really get people behind the campaign to realise the benefits of true collaboration."

            "text": "Today, collaboration can still be hard work because I\u2019m essentially asking people to go above and beyond their day job, and they don\u2019t always get to see the benefits immediately. I\u2019ve had to prove my worth, as well as the campaign\u2019s worth, but over time LAs have started to see first-hand that by working together, we really do achieve more. In 10 years, there have been many milestones and the partnership has evolved and grown. We are always thinking about what we can do to support the profession more.\u00a0 My role is very much about enabling and facilitating."

This brought about spin-offs in support of the programme\u2019s wider \u2018Attract and Support\u2019 recruitment and retention priorities. Today the CSWM brand is recognised nationally by the sector, as an example of what can be achieved through successful collaboration and innovation."

CSWM does this by championing the\u00a0voices of social workers through videos to give real insight into social work across the region, and by providing a learning platform on their website for social workers to access CPD. The approach is based on shared learning that allows LAs to share new initiatives and projects in their area.\u201d"

She was great at galvanizing wider sector support, achieving early buy in from our region\u2019s\u00a0Association of Directors of Childrens Service (ADCS) group and getting senior leadership support. This was instrumental in driving change and improvement. Alison felt quite strongly about taking control of the profession\u2019s narrative. She didn\u2019t want to just allow the media to tell the story from their perspective."

It continues today with Mel John-Ross who is Executive Director of Children\u2019s Services in Barnsley and lead DCS for CSWM. I\u2019d say one of the critical success factors from the beginning is that CSWM has the full support of senior leaders in our region. They are always accessible and keen to help drive new initiatives as needed."

If somebody is shortlisted in our region, we\u2019ll run a feature in our newsletter and website. It really helps to boost workforce morale and strikes up a bit of healthy competition between LAs. This year we are proud sponsors of the \u2018Children\u2019s Social Worker of the Year\u2019 category."

In June 2022, we will be hosting the fifth Festival of Social Work Conference, so child and family social workers will be able to benefit from a range of new resources and access great keynote speakers, including industry experts and care leavers."
