Over two short days, we enjoyed a diverse mix of sessions presented by our colleagues, our senior leaders and our wonderful guest speakers. Every presentation and panel discussion gave us plenty to think about for the future and some useful insights that we can learn from to help inform our everyday work and how we approach the bigger issues like our strategy and the continuous development of our people."

This involved being part of a live question and answer session, which also included our inspiring guest speaker, Bernadette Thompson OBE,\u00a0the Deputy Director for Inclusion, Wellbeing and Employee Engagement at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).\u00a0I was\u00a0honoured, and a little nervous at first, to be asked\u00a0to take part. \u00a0I was invited onto the panel in my role as\u00a0the chair of our new\u00a0GIAA Green Network.\u00a0I was worried\u00a0about being able to articulate myself confidently in such an important live audience\u00a0discussion, but I am very glad that I took up that challenge and stepped out of my comfort zone. Bernadette was such an amazing\u00a0speaker;\u00a0I am so grateful that I got to be part of such a meaningful discussion."

It was a fine example of how the Agency empowers success, especially as it was created and edited entirely by Elisha Smith, a Government Communication Service (GCS) apprentice who is working in our GIAA Communication team."

This was a valuable task that enabled me to meet with more members of the wider GIAA trainee and apprentice community. And provided me with the chance to celebrate and showcase their talent as well as the support, that we receive in GIAA. It also let me consolidate and demonstrate how much I\u2019ve learnt in my role to date."

I was fortunate enough to be shortlisted for the Agency\u2019s \u2018Respectful\u2019 value award. The recognition and positive comments from colleagues across the Agency went a really long way in not only boosting my confidence but reminding me of the valuable contributions that we make to the Agency every day."
