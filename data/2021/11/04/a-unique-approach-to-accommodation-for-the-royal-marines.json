[Crown Copyright / MOD 2021]I was proud to lead a recent DIO project to construct a new state-of-the-art bespoke accommodation block for injured Royal Marine recruits. The new block at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM) Lympstone in Devon was completed ahead of schedule and on budget."

In order to have sufficient space for the new building, we had to alter the course of an adjacent road, requiring some extensive retaining walls to be constructed."

            "text": "Thanks to those conversations, the new block is adaptable in how it can be used. It provides complete flexibility in how rooms and floors can be allocated. There are 21 eight-bed rooms and one ten-bed, as well as three single Duty of Care rooms for supporting staff. All rooms have been designed so that they can be allocated to either male or female occupants. This was achieved in part by incorporating en-suite ablutions to each room which allows each adjacent bedroom to be occupied by either male or female occupants. The mixture of male and females occupying the building is then not limited to either floors or proportionate size of communal ablutions."

The multifunction communal and recreation space has televisions and a projector and screen for both entertainment and education, a kitchenette for drinks and IT provision. It can be used as a classroom when required or for individual learning and has all amenities required to provide this alternative function.
