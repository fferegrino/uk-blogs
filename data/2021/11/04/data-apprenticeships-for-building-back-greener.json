Does our workforce have the skills, knowledge or capability to deliver sustainability through innovation? And if so, to what extent can data apprenticeships bridge the gap?"

            "text": "The demand for people with data science skills is growing and it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to find and keep people with this knowledge and experience. So, companies are taking a different approach. Businesses are retraining existing employees and technical teams. Data apprenticeships enable data science to be deployed by different teams across the organisation, providing new skills to workforces on the frontline of climate change."

            "text": "Whether a company is working on low-carbon projects, creating efficiencies in logistics or manufacturing, it\u2019s data that keeps them laser-focused on their challenges and will drive clear decision making. Regardless of your sustainability vision or ideas for a solution, large volumes of information relating to \u2018how things are done now\u2019 must be gathered and analysed for inefficiencies to be identified; for example relating to manufacturing waste, plastic usage or retail transport standards."

            "text": "To increase the sustainability impact our apprentices can make, Cambridge Spark is developing a \u2018data science for sustainability' curriculum. Using Cambridge Spark\u2019s data science learning platform, EDUKATE.AI, apprentices will work on assignments that simulate real-world sustainability challenges and use data science to tackle them. This will accelerate their sustainability journey and deepen the impact of it for themselves and their employers."
