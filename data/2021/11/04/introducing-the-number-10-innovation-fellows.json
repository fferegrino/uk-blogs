It is thanks to vaccine research that we all have an immediate future that is happier and full of more opportunity. We\u2019re putting the UK at the forefront of attracting, developing and retaining world-class talent, making it easier for top scientists and technologists to move to the UK and creating programmes to develop the brightest at home. And we want this world-class talent in government as well as in our industries and our universities. That is why we have launched the No.10 Innovation Fellowships to bring brilliant minds from the digital and tech sector into government, to help tackle some of the most pressing public policy challenges of our time.\u00a0 I very much enjoyed meeting the first cohort on the programme, and look forward to seeing their progress over the next 12 months\u201d"

In the next year, my main goal is to learn as much as I can and positively impact as much as I can over the duration of my Fellowship! I hope to highlight that innovation is not only about technology, but a way of thinking and working - and to embed that within the teams I will work with."
