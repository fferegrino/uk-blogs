        },
        {
            "text": "This means that giving good feedback is essential \u2013 both to making sure the design is as good as it can be, and to ensuring that the amends process runs smoothly. We asked our design team what good, helpful feedback looks like."

            "text": "Sharing examples of campaigns or designs you think are attractive or successful is useful as it can help us to understand the tone you\u2019re looking for and how simple or complex the ask is."
        },
        {
            "text": "Keep it simple. Sharing 6 very different videos can be more confusing than helpful, but if there\u2019s a particular illustration style or colour scheme that you\u2019ve seen, don\u2019t be afraid to share it. If you\u2019re new to the process, our website is a good place to find examples."

            "text": "It helps to be specific, so try to avoid phrases like \u2018make it punchy\u2019 or \u2018give it some pop\u2019. Instead you could say, \u2018we\u2019d like the photos to show people looking into the camera\u2019, or, \u2018brighter colours would work better for this audience\u2019. Being specific can be especially important if we\u2019re following strict brand guidelines."

        },
        {
            "text": "Constructive feedback helps us to develop designs, but if it\u2019s overly prescriptive it can limit us. Describe the problem \u2013 for example, \u2018the text boxes look too cramped\u2019 \u2013 and trust the designer to solve it. Balancing specific requests with some level of creative freedom is the best way to get the most from your designer."

            "text": "The project manager should have a discussion with you about how you will supply your feedback. Once a process is agreed, stick to it as much as possible \u2013 for example, marking up amends on a PDF using the correct tools."
        },
        {
            "text": "It\u2019s more time-consuming if feedback is supplied in different formats, such as some via email and some via PDF. This also creates more chances for errors to creep in \u2013 for example, increasing the potential for feedback to get missed."

            "text": "Our designers work hard to meet your needs, so it\u2019s important that feedback is clear and constructive. When possible, face-to-face feedback is useful as it gives you the chance to engage directly with designers and discuss any changes or complex questions. It\u2019s also an efficient way of getting all the appropriate stakeholders in one place."

            "text": "The people who get the best from their designers show trust and respect, communicate clearly and politely, and establish expectations upfront. It\u2019s natural to want to offer your own solutions, but designers are experts and are best-placed to translate your needs into effective and engaging design solutions. Explore and compare the work together, and you\u2019ll reap the rewards."
