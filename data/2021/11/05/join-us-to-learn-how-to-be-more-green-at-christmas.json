Our current group was formed in December 2020 with a group of 5 people who wanted to see what we could do to help educate other people and ourselves about climate change and live our lives a bit greener. From our small start we now have over 100 members. We run monthly \u2018lunch and learn\u2019 sessions with a variety of subjects from \u2018honey bees\u2019 to \u2018saving our oceans\u2019 but again with a focus on \u2018what you can do\u2019."
