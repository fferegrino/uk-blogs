They have been carrying out a \u2018Year of Waste Challenge\u2019 where they are set monthly challenges by the Trust Leader/CEO. So far, they have focused on waste crime, clothes production and reducing the schools carbon footprint. The children have also carried out their own investigations into food waste, travel to school, electricity use, and have presented further improvement ideas and held the school to account."
