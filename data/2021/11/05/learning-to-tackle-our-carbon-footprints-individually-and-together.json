We all want to do something, anything that will help us out of our climate crisis, right? This is our biggest, global environmental challenge. We have been talking about it for decades; climate change, the climate crisis, the biodiversity emergency. It\u2019s not new."

We\u2019ll cut our emissions by at least 45% and offset the rest through projects that bring added benefits for people and nature, such as reduced flood risk and more, better habitats."

The training will help us all understand our impacts on the environment, our individual and collective carbon footprints, and the actions we can take to reduce these at work and at home. It will help educate, inform and inspire us to make better decisions and change our behaviours \u2013 and to influence others to do the same."

The training included a climate-science module and a group discussion where we talked about our ability and motivation to reduce emissions, on an individual, community and organisational basis. If we want to be role models, to actively do something, then this training is a good nudge, a great start, and it seems it\u2019s gathering momentum."

To develop and create a small mixed woodland / orchard habitat, bringing benefits in terms of climate change, biodiversity and the opportunity to increase both habitat, wildlife and the future amenity value for all those that use it. I have secured funding for the trees, engaged our local councillors, have volunteers young and old for the tree planting, and bird and bat boxes will be put up too. A series of story boards will also be created to explain why the \u2018Trees for the Future\u2019 project matters."

Putting learning into action, using your voice and turning it into a wider conversation. It is about listening, talking, thinking and working together. We did something."
