To illustrate looking for fluctuations of 1 ppm (parts per million) on the current average global CO2 concentration of 414 ppm, sensors are launched by international and national space agencies and the private sector. The measurement uncertainties need to be tied to physical constants of nature through primary standards of the International System of Units (SI) provided by NMIs such as NPL."

Providing a fully automated state-of-the-art solution to instrument calibration and characterisation in a single facility, ensures the needed performance is achieved while also minimising the time and effort involved in the pre-launch vacuum test environment. In essence, the facility combines together in a single transportable package, the contents of NPL radiometric calibration capabilities which normally occupy three laboratories at the Teddington site."

            "text": "STAR-cc-OGSE incorporates both white light and a monochromatic source (i.e. using one colour) built from a unique laser which can dial up any wavelength from the ultraviolet to the shortwave infrared. The white light source mimics the Sun and tests the sensor in a mode similar to how it views the Earth, while the monochromatic source is better at understanding the instrument performance in a more diagnostic way. The radiometric output of the STAR-cc-OGSE is fully traceable to the NPL cryogenic radiometer (compares the heating effect of optical radiation to that of electrical power) and can provide unprecedented uncertainties well below 0.5 % - making it reliable. By providing innovative high SI-traceable accuracy to the pre-flight calibration of satellite instruments, the facility will aid UK and global Earth Observation missions."

However, until recent innovations by M-squared lasers, it has not been possible to create a transportable turn-key facility such as STAR than can deliver SI-traceability at accuracy levels needed for measuring climate change."

Whilst it is widely acknowledged that human-activity driven climate change is happening, there are still uncertainties around how the natural world is reacting to changes in the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Currently approximately 50% of our emissions are taken up by natural sinks on land and in oceans, but how this changes with time remains a big unknown."
