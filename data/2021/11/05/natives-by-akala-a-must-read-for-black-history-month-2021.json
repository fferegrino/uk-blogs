            "text": "Akala is a well-known figure in the UK, as hip-pop artist, social entrepreneur and public speaker. He is an outspoken critic on (the growing) inequality in the UK, focusing on class and race. In this book he shows what it was like to grow up in Camden as a poor, mixed raced kid in the 1980s. He shows how being in the wrong place at the wrong time is the most important factor determining the outcome for black Britons."
        },
        {
            "text": "In this well-researched book, Akala explores how the exceptional achievements of black people do not provide evidence that the perceived obstacles of poverty and race can be overcome by all. Additionally, he goes further and shines a light on narratives ranging from disturbing truths about history and contemporary politics, accompanied by auto-biographical passages."
        },
        {
            "text": "However, it was Akala\u2019s lived experience told clearly and graphically that kept me reeling as I read. I was shocked by the how the school system treated Akala, putting him in a lower class with the assumption that black people are less intelligent. They even disputed that he had read certain books and he would be constantly overlooked when trying to answer questions in class."
        },
        {
            "text": "On aspects of history, Akala challenges some of the notions that underpin British history. For example, Akala argues against \u201dWilliam Wilberforce as the \u2018white saviour\u2019 who freed his black ancestors from slavery\u201d, and \u201cBritain being the first country to abolish slavery\u201d. This book is not just about race. Akala also writes \u201cclass affects everything, even racism\u201d. The main message of the book is how race and class are constructed categories benefiting the ruling elite, and that this is something that needs attention not only in Great Britain, but in other European countries as well."
