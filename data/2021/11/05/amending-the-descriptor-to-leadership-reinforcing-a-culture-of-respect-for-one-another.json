Selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership continue to reflect the standards the public expect of those who serve them."

Often referred to as the \u2018tone from the top\u2019, it was clear that having good role models endorsing and promoting high ethical standards matters throughout organisations, but for those in senior positions it was considered essential."

Our latest review highlighted that a lack of respect for different opinions and points of view continues to hamper progress in developing a public culture which values high ethical standards and embraces the Seven Principles of Public Life. Our intention in amending the leadership principle is to challenge and foster a more constructive approach."

However, against a backdrop of increasing intimidation and abuse, along with the greater awareness of issues of harassment and bullying, the Committee has come to the view that this should be made explicit in the descriptor. So too should it be explicit that all public office holders have a direct responsibility to challenge poor conduct."

            "text": "To be clear, the principle of leadership doesn\u2019t only apply to Ministers, CEOs or line managers, or only relate to actions taken at board level.

This is a good thing, and no one would want to return to an age of deference. But listening to the views of others and treating people with respect is critical to open, robust decision making in the wider public interest."
