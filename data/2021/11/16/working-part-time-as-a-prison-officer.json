It\u2019s great, because it means I get to spend more time with my family, including sharing the school runs with my wife. And, because I work a maximum of four days back-to-back, I\u2019ve got plenty of time to rest on my days off \u2013 and more energy to entertain the kids when they\u2019re not at school!\u201d"

So, if one of us is working a day shift, the other will cover the night shift. And we\u2019ll swap for our next shift pattern. Also, rather than doing seven nights \u2018on\u2019 \u2013 like we would if we were full-time \u2013 one of us will work four nights, and the other three.\u201d"

Plus I work one weekend a month, and I tend to do a bit of over-time once or twice a month, working around my wife\u2019s work, to make a bit of extra money.\u201d"

This really helps my wife and I plan ahead so we know which of us is available to take our children to dentist or doctors\u2019 appointments, and the like."
