            "text": "Whilst RWE and OECD work has transferred seamlessly online, some of the ad hoc engagement that often arises spontaneously from encounters in person has been more difficult to sustain virtually. Existing conferences and arrangements have been suspended, and in many countries regulatory scrutiny practices have been temporarily suspended or streamlined in response to the pandemic. During this period, we have maintained our networks and considered the regulatory approaches taken by different countries."

We will continue to develop our relationship with this crucial trading partner and we plan to undertake a programme of regulatory support, with colleagues from across the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy."

The Chancellor remarked that \u201cTo live together, we need a certain amount of rules. On the other hand, the acceptance of [these rules] should not suffer. Therefore, you have to weigh carefully.\u201d"
