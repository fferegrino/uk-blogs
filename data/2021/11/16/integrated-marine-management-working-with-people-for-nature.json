Marianne is an interdisciplinary scientist and marine manager, who joined us from Fauna & Flora International in Cambodia, where she managed and developed marine conservation projects and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with fishing communities, NGOs and the government agencies.\u00a0 She led the development of a programme of work supporting a network of MPAs, with integrated projects to protect vulnerable habitats, tackle marine litter, reduce endangered species by-catch and trade, address financing gaps, and support the development of sustainable coastal enterprises."

We asked Marianne how she came to work in this sector and what \u2018integrated marine management\u2019 means to her. Here is her story:"

            "text": "\u201cDuring and after my academic studies, I worked with environmental and research groups in London, Indonesia and Malta, learning a breadth of approaches from marine algae genetics to coral reef surveys. Becoming motivated by how science and local knowledge is used in practice to solve coastal challenges, I began engaging with community-based conservation and small-scale fisheries initiatives.\u00a0 I supported Blue Ventures\u2019 work in Madagascar, looking at how the carbon value of mangroves could benefit coastal livelihoods and conservation initiatives, before moving to an island in Cambodia to work with a local community-based non-profit organisation.\u00a0 There, I supported the management and monitoring of what became the country\u2019s first multiple-use MPA, designed to support sustainable fishing livelihoods and protect biodiversity. This led to my work with the non-profit Fauna & Flora International, leading a coastal-wide marine programme with a collective of partners."

It\u2019s an inclusive approach to planning and management that balances marine conservation and sustainable resource use, considering social, cultural and economic impacts, as well as ecological. Each MPA and community I\u2019ve worked with is totally unique, which makes the job diverse, fun and challenging!"
