            "text": "On the BBC radio programme, \u2018The Life Scientific\u2019 in early October, Sir Patrick Vallance argued for the application of the scientific method to policymaking. This wasn\u2019t just about employing more STEM grads. It was an argument for a broader shift in the way that governments solve problems. When developing policy, governments at every level - including my own - should rigorously test their assumptions and hypotheses using empirical observation and inductive reasoning wherever possible."

            "text": "Listening to the life scientific made me wonder whether Patrick Vallance would recognise policy design as part of this transition. It also made me wonder how many policy design practitioners would recognise themselves as being part of a movement for greater scientific rigour in policymaking. Our experience in the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham suggests that this is a missed opportunity."

Each of these disciplines has its roots in a different branch of science and \u2013 in its own way \u2013 represents an application of the scientific method to policymaking. To take a few examples:"

            "text": "Embracing these traditions would help the movement for policy design generate both traction and credibility. But it would also challenge the community to practice these disciplines with the same level of precision that you would expect from any scientist. Any policymaker can \u2013 and should \u2013 make use of personas, user journeys, and prototypes, but the best results are achieved when these tools are applied with deep knowledge, expertise, and experience."

IDEO have long pioneered the idea of the T-shaped professional, with deep expertise in one area and the ability to collaborate through engaging seriously with the disciplines of others. In Barking & Dagenham, we are fortunate enough to employ a group of \u2018policy design\u2019 practitioners \u2013 both within the Council\u2019s Insight Hub but also across other corporate services - with deep expertise in one or more of the disciplines already mentioned. Through working together on real world problems, this group are becoming increasingly T-shaped."

And I have watched them work with our behavioural scientists to pilot assertive outreach models that make use of these insights to ensure residents on the edge get the support they need - before debt turns into homelessness or any other form of crisis."

We are now much better at distinguishing between those residents that can afford to pay \u2013 with limited impact on their life and circumstances - and those for whom a repayment would tip them over the edge. We generate more revenue whilst providing the right kind of help to those that need it. But don\u2019t just take it from me\u2026"

            "text": "These results have come from allowing expert service designers, behavioural scientists, and data scientists to practice their craft, working alongside those with deep expertise in policy and/or service delivery. Our next frontier is to make the tools, frameworks, and mindsets that come from these disciplines available to the rest of the organisation \u2013 we have a way to go to develop a deeper culture of policy design. But we will be careful to do so in a way that continues to respect the scientific traditions of the disciplines themselves, and that manages expectations about what can be achieved without mastery."
