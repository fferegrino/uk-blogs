But we have also shown you the work that is being planned and undertaken to monitor impacts and to identify solutions and mitigations."

Driven by UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Programme also underpins the 25 Year Action Plan and the global ambition for 30% of the world\u2019s oceans to be protected by 2030. It is central to the UK Government\u2019s ambition of leading global action against illegal fishing, climate change and species conservation."

By using nature-based solutions in the management of their climate smart MPAs, they are helping to protect against biodiversity loss and increase resilience to the changes in our climate."

            "text": "One way this is happening is in the protection of blue carbon habitats, which help to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide and store it for future use. For example, Tristan da Cunha\u2019s MPZ\u2019s fishing ban, which includes \u2018bottom-trawling\u2019, prevents fishing gear from disturbing habitat sediments and releasing carbon."

And the Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS) project \u2013 which is being rolled out across many of the Blue Belt overseas territories - is informing that knowledge as well as being instrumental in monitoring and protecting coastal habitats to help them capture and store carbon."

St. Helena has recently deployed inshore and seamount acoustic listening stations to monitor fish movements and promote future fish stocks. The data collected is contributing to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) stock assessments. Further monitoring of climate change impacts is planned to better understand and predict change as well as identify potential mitigating actions."

In BAT, where the duration of winter sea ice cover has shortened due to the warming of the oceans, BRUVS will help to better monitor the impact on animals living in the surface waters and those on the seafloor."

Importantly, Blue Belt overseas territories are doing just that. And the work that they are undertaking will not only help to protect their own fantastic biodiversity but will hopefully provide a greater insight into climate change for the wider, global community."
