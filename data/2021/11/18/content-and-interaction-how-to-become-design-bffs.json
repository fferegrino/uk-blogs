Setting up a \u2018ways of working\u2019 session is a great way to decide how you\u2019re going to collaborate as a team and who\u2019s involved at each stage. The key here is to collaborate early and often."

You sketch out ideas and contemplate how you might design a suitable solution \u2013 or stare at a problem statement for an hour or two. Add both design professions into the mixing pot, whether that\u2019s in a collaborative workshop session or in a joint Miro or Figma board, and that\u2019s when you really see designs come to life."

I wouldn\u2019t always expect a content designer to know how to write code, but that should never be an assumption of mine that they don\u2019t. It's important to ensure that you are using the most appropriate application that you and your BFF design fellow can work most efficiently in."

We make prototypes as a team. There will be moments where you\u2019ll need to split off and work independently, but always give a full debrief of what you\u2019ve been working on so there\u2019s complete transparency and understanding of your decisions.\u00a0"

The nature of our work always ensures that we are designing as much as possible with the voice of the user.

It doesn\u2019t mean that they shouldn\u2019t be included. It\u2019s that inclusion that makes us better collaborators.\u00a0"
