            "text": "Although there\u2019s a \u2018set design\u2019 for Companies House online services (created by my super-talented team of user-centred designers based on GOV.UK standards), did you know that as a user, you have a huge degree of control over what a webpage or website looks like for you?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Our users will sometimes ask for changes to our services to meet their individual needs: \u201ccan you make the text larger?\u201d, \u201ccan you change the background colour?\u201d We could, of course, react to all these individual requests, but what happens when another user asks for smaller text, or a different coloured background?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Our services are designed and built to be adaptable. You might notice this if you look at a Companies House webpage on a laptop and then look at the same page on a smartphone \u2013 the layout changes, the text size is different. It\u2019s still the same page, but behind the scenes the webpage detects the device it\u2019s being viewed on and adjusts itself accordingly, as if by magic!"
        },
        {
            "text": "That adaptability extends beyond which device the service is being shown on. As the user, you can adapt how an individual page, or an entire online service, looks and behaves."

            "text": "Going back to the 2 examples above, let\u2019s look at text size first."
        },

            "text": "You can change the text size in our online services to meet your needs in a variety of ways. You can do this temporarily by using some simple keyboard commands, or you could do it permanently by adjusting settings in your web browser (typically something like Google Chrome) or on your device\u2019s operating system (that might be Windows, Android, or Mac OS). You can even change the text style (font) and text colour."
        },
        {
            "text": "How about changing the background colour? This works in the same way. By adjusting settings in your technology, you could make the change permanent or temporary, and a change that affects one webpage, one website, or all the websites you visit."
        },
        {
            "text": "The advantage of letting users completely customise and adapt our online services to suit their needs is that the changes they make could also be applied to other websites (if the user chooses). If a user prefers a yellow background on Companies House services, chances are they prefer yellow backgrounds on all the websites they visit. And of course, user needs may change over time."

            "text": "AbilityNet\u2019s My Computer My Way provides simple step-by-step instructions on how to adapt your phone, computer, or tablet to meet your needs. You can search for a specific need (for example, making text larger) or filter the guides based on your symptoms (for example, hand tremors) or condition (for example, dyslexia)."
