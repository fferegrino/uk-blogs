I decided to complete a PGCE course to share my passion and knowledge of science with young people."

It will also provide me with essential experience of managing competing commitments and priorities across a breadth of areas within schools, so that I am empowered to support pupils. The network of peers, school leaders and subject matter experts who support and deliver the course will also help me develop new skills which are school-focused and relevant to my setting."

Discovering new strategies to combat truancy, low-level disruption, backchatting or even aggressive behaviour are always welcome in the classroom. That these strategies are backed by a broad evidence base will empower me further: I can have confidence in addressing these problem behaviours with the solid foundation my NPQ will have provided."

However, I feel it is important to highlight that the NPQLBC is not just about my career progression. I\u2019m excited to see the immediate benefits in my practice \u2013 this classroom-based experience, rooted in evidence based research, can make an impact straight away, irrespective of my career path."

Many challenges have arisen due to the pandemic which has unsettled the journey our young people take through the years, in addition to the transition between primary and secondary school. We have students who attend our schools from disadvantaged backgrounds, children in care, those with EAL needs as well as SEND students. Quite simply, many of these children need support to get them back on track and to close some of the attainment gaps which developed over the course of the pandemic. To create a culture in which we support all of our pupils to strive to achieve their best, as well as model to them the correct behaviours and link this to the school being a safe environment, is crucial to develop our pastoral performance \u2013 with a view that this will, in turn, promote success inside and outside of the classroom."
