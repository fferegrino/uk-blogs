            "text": "In years to come we might well look back on November 2021 as a turning point in our relationship with Nature. It will be remembered as the month when\u00a0the UK helped to forge commitments at COP26 that we hope, with the goodwill and action of the governments involved, will give us a chance of limiting\u00a0the\u00a0global temperature increase to 1.5C.\u00a0Perhaps even more than that, though,\u00a0COP\u00a0resulted in world leaders seeing Nature in a new light \u2013 as an essential part of the drive to tackle climate change through\u00a0Nature-based solutions such as\u00a0sustainable farming and\u00a0reducing deforestation."

            "text": "In England, November 2021 also saw the very welcome addition to the statute book of a new Environment Act, the most ground-breaking piece of environmental legislation in many years. For the first time this Act will set clear statutory targets for the recovery of the natural world in four priority areas: air quality, biodiversity, water and waste, and includes an important new target to reverse the decline in species abundance by the end of 2030. It sets in law new tools that Natural England and others can use to help meet those targets, which will at last enable us to lift the grim graphs of species decline upward towards a Nature-positive 2030."

            "text": "With such transformational potential, it really does change the context in which we work\u00a0and means the 25 Year Environment Plan can move from ambition to reality\u00a0as the first statutory Environmental Improvement Plan.\u00a0The inclusion of\u00a0five Environmental Principles in the Act (namely integration, prevention, rectification at source, polluter pays and precautionary),\u00a0and the need for all Government Ministers to consider them when making policy,\u00a0will help increase the\u00a0opportunities for\u00a0Nature recovery across Government."

            "text": "There will also be a new Office for Environmental\u00a0Protection.\u00a0Natural England very much welcomes the formation of this new body\u00a0and we\u00a0are\u00a0already developing an open, collaborative working relationship to help further our joint goals of environmental protection and improvement.\u00a0The Act will also enable reform of the Habitats\u00a0Regulations\u00a0following public consultation. We will be closely involved in this process,\u00a0helping to\u00a0ensure that any revised regime is able to go beyond protection and to also support the restoration of Nature."

        {
            "text": "Natural England is proud to have played an important part in shaping the Act\u00a0since its inception. We are continuing to work with Defra\u00a0and other Government Departments on\u00a0developing the targets and\u00a0drafting the statutory guidance that underpins the enhanced NERC (biodiversity reporting) duty on public authorities, Local Nature Recovery Strategies, the power to create protected site and species conservation strategies and the whole\u00a0new\u00a0system for biodiversity net gain. The latter will require developers to ensure an increase in biodiversity through their projects, and Natural England is pleased to see it extended to include Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project developments and the marine environment."

            "text": "These\u00a0measures will give us a great opportunity to develop even closer relationships with our partners as we work together to restore Nature at a landscape and local scale.\u00a0For example, Natural England is\u00a0working with Defra,\u00a0local\u00a0authorities\u00a0and place-based stakeholders\u00a0such as\u00a0the Wildlife Trusts\u00a0to deliver Local Nature Recovery Strategies\u00a0which will help deliver\u00a0Nature\u00a0recovery within a national framework.\u00a0We are helping develop the use of Conservation Covenants and will \u00a0apply to become a responsible body, enabling us to enter into voluntary agreements with landowners to conserve their land\u2019s natural or heritage features for the long-term."

        {
            "text": "With these additional tools and strengthened relationships we\u00a0can do even more to establish\u00a0a Nature Recovery Network that creates new places for Nature, linking\u00a0up our best wildlife sites and bringing\u00a0new ones much closer to places where people live."
        },
        {
            "text": "Alongside a new farming policy and renewed ambition for our protected landscapes, the new\u00a0Act is a powerful piece of legislation containing many of the measures that the environment sector has been seeking for some time. At this turning point for Nature, however, it is important to remember that the law is but one tool that will enable us to achieve Nature recovery, and alongside that will be the essential partnerships that in the end will be vital to the progress that we must make during the years ahead."
