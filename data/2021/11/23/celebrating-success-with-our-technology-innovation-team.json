Our work, delivered through collaboration with key technology partners, has recently been recognised for pushing boundaries and using emerging technologies to bring positive change.We recently received accolades for two of our exploration initiatives. Firstly, our proof-of-concept with Forestry Commission Forest Research colleagues and our technology partner Vodafone, which explored the use of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to remotely monitor how effective trees in forests are at absorbing carbon dioxide. This work, which answered very pressing questions in the world of forestry science regarding climate change, has won the National Technology Award \u2013 \u2018Tech for Good\u2019 2021."

            "text": "It\u2019s important for forest trees, but it\u2019s important for much more - as the IoT technologies can be used to extend Defra group\u2019s monitoring to anything in the environment that has previously been out of reach. This innovative initiative has been widely reported in the press (googling will link to many articles!). A useful overview can also be found here."

            "text": "The potential to make use of this IoT technology is huge, enabling us to increase the scale of our monitoring, including finally being able to get to those locations that have been impossible to get to and providing significantly more data for supporting policymaking and our operations."

The second example is our proof of concept with Environment Agency colleagues, and our technology partner Atos, to practically explore high performance compute (HPC) technology for speeding up flood modelling. This work was shortlisted for the Responsible Business Alliance Compass 2021 Awards - 'Innovation' Category."

            "text": "During a flood incident it\u2019s critical (given the huge risks to life and property) to be able to predict as quickly as possible what might happen, and therefore anything that can speed up the computer modelling is really valuable."

The findings of the proof-of-concept work are feeding into the Environment Agency\u2019s current strategic work on defining its modelling capability."

Our goal, as I said at the start, is to help Defra group make the most of new digital technologies, and it\u2019s probably worth me pointing out the key common aspects essential for doing this successfully:"
