Kirsty is a maths teacher at Goodwin Academy and was awarded Outstanding New Teacher of the Year. Paul is Principal at Weston College and was recognised for Lifetime Achievement. We asked them both what it was like to win an award and to share any advice they have for those in the profession."

The influx of messages, emails and phone calls I received that evening were overwhelming - from old friends, colleagues, family members and even complete strangers. I spent the rest of the evening feeling emotional and full of pride. I had won a national award! An award for simply doing what I love - teaching! It\u2019s a privilege not only to help shape my students\u2019 success but to also mentor student teachers and help them be the best they can be."

To hear it announced on the One Show and to moreover receive it for my leadership in Further Education came as a massive surprise, but I also felt elated for all the talented staff and learners I have had the pleasure to work with over my career. It was a privilege to be among such esteemed company \u2013 the passion, the hunger from my fellow winners to achieve greatness for all their learners, is remarkable. I would really encourage those who know people making a difference to the lives of young people to enter the awards - there are awards for innovation, excellence and being that bit unique and it was a delight to be part of such a special celebration."

I\u2019d also encourage you to talk to colleagues about how you\u2019re feeling or anything you are worried about. They can listen, provide advice and, most importantly, relate. Lastly, prioritisation is key. Consider what tools and techniques you can use to manage your time and reduce workload where possible. Your own wellbeing should be a priority, as well as that of your students."

The one thing I tell all my leadership team is to look beyond expectations, believe in the impossible and that we excel when a learner, who others had given up on, becomes one of our success stories. Contributing to that transformation of a student is really meaningful."

I also work hard to develop their resilience, helping them to recognise that it is ok to make mistakes and often these are opportunities to learn. Also, I remind them to reward themselves for achievements - even if it\u2019s something small - like finishing a piece of work or grasping a new concept."

There are many ways to achieve success but for me, focusing on careers not courses is key. I have established individual Career Excellence Hubs to link learners and their teachers to industries and employers. It\u2019s different, and it stretches all concerned. Suddenly there is a vibrancy, a hunger to succeed and we can help them exceed their own expectations through these joint projects, with innovative and proven support."
