Everyone has bad days amongst the good: it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve got mental health issues. That may be so and maybe there is nothing seriously wrong with me. Or it may be a refusal to face up to the symptoms. Like any health condition, the earlier you get help, the greater the chance of getting better. So often, people turn to support later than they should have, waiting until it has reached crisis point before they do anything."

Why should it be different with mental health issues? (34% of men would be embarrassed or ashamed to take time off work for mental health concerns such as anxiety or depression compared to 13% for a physical injury)"

(38% of men would be concerned that their employer would think badly of them if they took time off work for a mental health concern \u2013 compared to 26% for a physical injury)."

That\u2019s great, but I reckon nearly all of us have a mental state that could, potentially be wobbly. If that better describes you, there are still things that can be done to improve this, enhance your life and maybe protect yourself from slipping into one of those bigger conditions: watch your diet, keep tabs on your alcohol intake, try and get enough sleep, make sure you get exercise and fresh air, endeavour to foster a positive attitude to life, relax properly, draw on spirituality (whatever that may mean to you), think carefully about your life/work balance, accept that an hour could be better spent walking round the park or doing the gardening rather than staring blankly at the screen, identify a trusted friend you can chat with etc \u2013 the list goes on\u2026"

If you are in any doubt at all, doing nothing is not a sensible option. Please don\u2019t be afraid to talk to friends, family or contact your GP: whatever you do, do something. It\u2019s worth putting the effort in, it\u2019s worth taking the risks for."
