As proud parents we were looking forward to refreshing our mantlepiece and having an easy win for Christmas presents for friends and family. That was until we remembered our son\u2019s collection of stains that he keeps on his school jumpers and the sense of obligation to buy a replacement."

Had I not been able to buy an embroidered jumper from any of the three named retailers, I could have bought a plain red jumper from wherever I wanted."

By preventing parents having the freedom to choose between providers schools may be restricting competition and preventing parents and carers from getting a good deal."

Some schools have expressed concerns that allowing greater choice may lead to inconsistent quality and colours, or indeed threats to the availability of uniform items if an existing exclusive arrangement is ended."

The DfE have done this, enabled by Mike Amesbury MP\u2019s Private Members\u2019 Bill. We have worked with the DfE on this guidance, providing advice and sharing our research and expertise on how to help schools ensure they use competition to deliver benefits to their pupils and their families. This guidance strongly endorses schools using more than one supplier."

We have been calling for change in this market for some time. We commissioned our own research on the impact of uniform policy on its price and wrote to 30,000 schools to encourage them to think about the impact of their school uniform policies. The introduction of this new statutory guidance will hopefully signal the end to families paying the price for school policies."
