Due to the small number of large fires that have occurred in the RPA, the results of the model are very sensitive to new data. As such, the model is currently used only as indicative support to our DfE policy colleagues in their strategic decision making."

In this case, despite the data not being optimal from a theoretical point of view, the objective of supporting our DfE policy colleagues\u2019 analysis was achieved."
