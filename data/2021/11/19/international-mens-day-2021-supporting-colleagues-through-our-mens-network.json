In fact, suicide is the biggest cause of death of men under 35. Men are nearly 3 times more likely than women to become alcohol dependant and a 2016 survey found that one in 10 men described themselves as severely or extremely stressed."

I want to champion anything we can do as an organisation that really promotes these honest conversations, so I\u2019m proud to be executive sponsor of our men\u2019s network."

It\u2019s really important that we support each other, and it would be great to see this network grow to its full potential."
