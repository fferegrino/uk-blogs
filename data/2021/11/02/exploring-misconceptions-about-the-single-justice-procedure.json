A reporter can also request both the prosecution statements and the defendant\u2019s representations. Previously they had to attend court in person and write everything down. The public can also ask for the outcome of any case \u2013 including SJP."

After that, if they have not replied, the case will be heard by SJP. If the written evidence proves the charge beyond reasonable doubt, the magistrate convicts, and if it does not, they acquit. The protections outlined above allow for the defendant to declare that they did not receive the summons or appeal against the sentence."

            "text": "In general, courts can compel appearance by issuing a warrant, followed by police arresting the defendant and taking them to court in custody.\u00a0 However, this wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the minor offences that SJP deals with. As a result, magistrates\u2019 courts cannot force defendants to appear for these offences; defendants are free to choose whether to attend or not. Even if a warrant could be issued, it delays the proceedings, and if the police can\u2019t find the defendant, the defendant evades justice."

It saves time, resource and inconvenience for all involved, while also delivering justice."
