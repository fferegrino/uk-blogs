It has set ambitious targets on all levels: central, devolved and local government. On a national level, it has adopted a 2035 deadline for a 78% reduction in emissions and targets net-zero emissions by 2050."

            "text": "Throughout the 2010s, many government organisations established agile, evidence-based and user-centred ways of working, with multi-disciplinary teams working on policies, services and other forms of government action. In these teams, designers work closely with policy advisors, economists, product managers, developers, front-line staff and many other disciplines. Initially, most designers were part of digital service delivery teams. Now, they increasingly work within user-centred policy labs and with operations colleagues too."

            "text": "Unsurprisingly, more designers\u2019 work has intersected with climate, environmental and sustainability-related issues over the past few years. This has been partly driven by department-level commitments and work but also by individual civil servants\u2019 concerns about the climate emergency and a need to respond to it. Designers have proactively undertaken further work, including a monthly cross-government climate work show and tell, climate change-related service design meetups, and contributions to the cross-industry \u2018Design + Climate\u2019 community."

But as service designers are trained to understand contexts, investigate problems, and take a big picture view, applying these approaches to broad, complex and long-term issues is natural to many. Increasingly, they look at system-level change and move work further upstream."

Other people reduced the size of web-based service frontends. They thereby decreased the computational power required on a users\u2019 device. Loading no images, smaller fonts, and less text on a government service minimises the energy used by a citizens\u2019 phone or computer and, therefore, their emissions, too. At the same time, such interventions help make services more accessible and inclusive by reducing the network data required to access the services, which can be taxing for people with budget data plans. Providing hosting services, prototyping tools and design systems for all parts of the UK government from the centre allows such apparently minor improvements to have an impact at a significant scale."

That is why government organisations started intensifying their citizen engagement beyond widely common ethnographic user research practices, working with under-represented groups often far away from decision-making and power. It also reflects the collective recognition of the limits of the user-centred design approach and the potential of design to play a significant role in orchestrating necessary shifts in decision-making.\n\nOn a local level, Camden Council in northwest London has used a public consultation to co-draft its Climate Action Plan, a five-year programme of projects and activities to bring its vision of a zero-carbon borough to life."
