We have, unfortunately, seen the horrifying consequences of extremism time and time again. I was appalled by the murder of Sir David Amess MP. While an investigation is currently underway, it has been publicly reported that this incident was allegedly motivated by Islamist ideology. There is a clear need to address the issue of Islamist extremism."

We must remain vigilant of the impact that threats emanating from Afghanistan will have on our own security. Yet we must also be aware that Afghan refugees in the UK are being intimidated by far-right groups inspired by the white nationalist Great Replacement conspiracy theory."

            "text": "Afghanistan was not the only time events overseas impacted communities here in the UK. I was alarmed by what I saw following heightened military activity in Gaza back in May. As with the murder of Sir David Amess MP, there are legal limits to what can be said about this at present, as incendiary rhetoric alleged to have been voiced in north London since led to charges of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, with intent, likely to stir up racial hatred; and, in a separate case,\u202fsuspected religiously-aggravated assault.\u202fSuffice to say, there can be no place for antisemitism in this country."

I am acutely aware of the need for constant vigilance around this issue. I have also been concerned by what I have heard around intra-faith tension, especially with regards to persecution of the Ahmadiyya community."

            "text": "Over the past six months, I have been engaging widely across government, regulatory bodies, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies. I wanted a clear understanding of the issues they face while addressing extremism - whether that is online, in schools, prisons, charities, or elsewhere \u2013 and to look at the knowledge base on extremism, including with those who have front-line operational roles. I have also met with the Home Secretary and Baroness Williams of Trafford to discuss issues of concern."

The recommendations that I made to the Home Secretary on the future of the CCE have reflected this."

            "text": "Coming from a think-tank background, I recognise the importance of external expertise. I have therefore consulted with trusted external partners while also considering how government can further harness innovative thinking around counter-extremism within the academic and think-tank sector. The CCE\u2019s Academic Practitioner Counter Extremism Network (APCEN), set up last October, connects practitioners with leading academics specialising in the study of extremism. The forum gives them the opportunity to share information as well as identify knowledge gaps and I will be considering how to utilise APCEN further to better understand extremism."
