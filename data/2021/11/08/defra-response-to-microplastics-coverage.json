Our 5p plastic bag charge has reduced sales by 95% in the major supermarkets and we have now increased this to 10p and extended it to all retailers."

We are going further, and have recently announced our intention to consult on banning single-use plastic plates, cutlery and expanded polystyrene drinks containers. As well as this, from April 2022, a tax of \u00a3200 per tonne will apply to plastic packaging that does not contain at least 30% recycled content, which will encourage businesses to seek greener alternatives."

The Bill establishes a duty for the Secretary of State to set a legally binding target for fine particulate matter, the pollutant of most harm to health, alongside at least one further long-term air quality target. As set out in a policy paper published in August 2020, we\u2019re also specifically looking at average population exposure to PM2.5 across England and setting an additional long-term target on this."
