EDRM was critical to our permitting and compliance work, had around 4,000 users and held up to nine million documents covering 300,000 permits. It was expensive to maintain and at significant risk of failure. It was not compatible with Windows 10 and was held on Capgemini Data Centres, two additional drivers for its urgent replacement."

A proof of concept was completed and signed-off by the end of March 2020, along with a migration strategy in two parts. The build of the application and migration mapping activities were largely completed by late autumn 2020. Unfortunately, the building of the application environments in our cloud tenancy proved challenging and time-consuming which delayed work on the remaining functionality. This pushed our go-live date out."

The first migration (80% of the documents) required a production environment with a version of the application in it so permit folders could be created to push the documents into. This meant we had to push \u2018Version 1\u2019 of the application into production, even though we hadn\u2019t completed all of the functionality."

Throttling involves limiting the communication speed of ingoing data into a server or network device. Microsoft does this to protect end users of their services by de-prioritising large data transfers."
