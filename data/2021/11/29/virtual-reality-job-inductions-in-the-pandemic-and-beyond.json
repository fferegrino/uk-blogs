I'm hoping this induction will help me develop a sense of belonging to the Civil Service, and the stories on this page have begun to do that.\u201d"

The bulk of the 1,700 participants in the early pilots joined the Civil Service during the pandemic. Few had met their colleagues face-to-face, or even seen inside their new workplace."

The induction course has benefited from including individual and team stories, generated by the Civil Service Awards and Operational Delivery Profession, and through case studies provided by colleagues from the Department for Work and Pensions. \u2018Learning with a human face\u2019 has gained even greater value during this period of enforced isolation away from colleagues."

It is incredibly useful to point out gaps and inconsistencies in the learning material and to suggest ways of improving the course. The design tries hard to bring \u2018peer learning\u2019 to life. Feedback from participants regarding Futurelearn and its accessibility have been hugely positive."

They might be school leavers who\u2019ve never worked in an office, or they may be experienced professionals from another sector. Either way, we want to provide them with a superb, professional induction which equips them for their job and career, as part of A Modern Civil Service."
