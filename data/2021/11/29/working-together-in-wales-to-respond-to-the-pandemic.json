In Wales, we already have a close network of colleagues across the criminal justice system, but the pandemic tested and strengthened those relationships. We all focused our efforts on keeping the wheels of justice turning for those most in need."

Recognising the impact this would have on those waiting for their day in court, we established a Criminal Justice in Wales (CJiW) Recovery Group. The group \u2013 made up of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), Chief Police Officers, the Crown Prosecution Service, Youth Justice Service and Probation and Prison Service in Wales \u2013 worked together to make necessary changes and ensure we moved forward quickly in response to the pandemic."

This team supported our agile response as we strove to understand the changing external environment, put safety measures in place and keep our courts and tribunals operating safely and effectively."

In fact, in the Magistrates Courts the delays caused by the pandemic have been dealt with and work is listed on receipt.\u00a0 In our Crown Courts, West and North Wales can only be described as a success story, whilst in South Wales, we continue to move at pace and are making steady inroads into the backlog."

From day one, CJiW partners worked together to minimise the impact of the pandemic on victims, witnesses, defendants, professionals and court users involved in active cases. No organisation could have done this without the other. The co-operation and speed of our recovery is a real testament to the CJiW partnership in Wales."
