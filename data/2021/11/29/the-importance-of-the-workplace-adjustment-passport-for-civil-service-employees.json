The key is the term \u201cpassport\u201d \u2013 the document goes wherever I do in my career journey! For me, the passport has also been a useful prompt to re-assess any current adjustments that are in place and assess whether they are still sufficient or whether changes/additions are required."

            "text": "The Workplace Adjustment Passport is such a sensible and simple intervention that makes such a difference to an individual when they join a new team, or their line manager changes. However, its use is, at best, patchy with many staff unaware of its existence and in the case of managers, many lack training on what to do when presented with one. Whilst I am heartened to see recent promotion of this tool in some areas of government, knowledge of such basic support needs to become the norm rather than the exception."
