            "text": "An avian influenza outbreak can occur at any point in the year. However, the UK typically faces a seasonal increase in the risk of an avian influenza associated with the winter migration patterns of wild birds. Infected wild waterfowl can then infect local and sedentary wild bird species, poultry or other captive birds resulting in local transmission either directly between birds or indirectly by birds coming into contact with environmental contamination, including faeces and feathers from infected birds."

Although none of these strains easily infect people and aren't usually spread from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths."

This \u2018Eurasian\u2019 H5N1 strain of avian influenza is highly pathogenic to poultry and other birds, but the risk to human health is considered very low."

Only one case of H5 has been confirmed in a person in the UK, in early 2022. The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time. Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person."

While previous cases were confirmed as the H7 strain, January 2022 was the first time H5 has been detected in a human in the UK. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low.
