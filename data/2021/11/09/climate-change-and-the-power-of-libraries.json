Food waste reduction is just one area where we feel we can have real impact, and this year we have welcomed organisations providing community fridges and pantries into two of our libraries. Not only does this bring in new people who might not have visited before, but we have been able to develop free courses (for example on cooking from scratch or helping people pay less for utilities) to better support these visitors."

When it comes to climate change, it is absolutely clear that there is a real opportunity for libraries across the UK to play a leading role, making sure everyone has equal access to knowledge, information and support. It\u2019s what we do every day, after all."
