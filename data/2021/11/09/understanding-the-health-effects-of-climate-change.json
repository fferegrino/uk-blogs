The emergence of mosquito-borne viruses, such as West Nile Virus, is an increasing risk to UK public health due to a warming climate, and we have already seen evidence of this virus in the Netherlands and Germany, and outbreaks in Italy associated with hot spring weather."

        {
            "text": "Where we see extreme weather events and environmental changes that lead to more flooding (and the creation or expansion of wetlands) this affects both the density and distribution of native mosquitoes by providing new habitats for them. But a warming climate could also lead to non-native mosquitoes (such as the tropical species Aedes albopictus which has colonised Europe in recent decades) establishing and then increasing in numbers here in the UK. This increases the risk of diseases rarely seen in the UK such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika."

            "text": "Ticks are also a public health concern, with Lyme disease already endemic in the UK. Milder winters and springs will lengthen the periods ticks are active and biting (though it is also the case that warmer summers could limit their activity). Non-native ticks, imported on travelling pets and migratory birds, are now also being found in the UK, particularly associated with heatwave events, and their ability to survive and establish will be enhanced by climate change."

We are also engaged in ongoing research to assess the impact of climate change on mosquito and tick distribution and the diseases they can transmit. This helps us raise awareness of strategies for managing the problem, including how the public can reduce their own risks."

            "text": "Air pollution is a significant public health problem. Long term exposure (over years or lifetimes) reduces life expectancy, mainly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and lung cancer, but it is also linked to dementia, cognitive decline and early life effects. Many people will also feel short term effects due to episodes of higher levels of air pollution, with effects on lung function, exacerbation of asthma and we also see increases in respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions."

        {
            "text": "We know that air pollution levels are driven primarily by emissions such as those from vehicles or industry, which contribute to climate change. This is a vicious cycle as many experts note that more frequent and intense heat waves could lead to more episodes of high ozone and particulate matter (such as allergens in the air) which could harm health."

            "text": "UKHSA scientists have a crucial role in studying the evidence to understand the likely impacts of our changing climate on air quality and health. Through our wider work on all aspects of air quality we\u2019ll further develop and share the evidence base on air pollution harm and make the case that measures to improve air quality can also offer wider public health and wellbeing mutual-benefits, including an improvement in overall environmental quality, increased physical activity due to less reliance on vehicles, noise reduction, greater road safety and climate change mitigation."
