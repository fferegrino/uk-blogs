A sample of Shigella flexneri \u2013 the bacteria that causes dysentery \u2013 was taken from Private Cable, and this sample was the first and founding culture of what is now among the oldest \u2018living libraries\u2019 of bacteria in the world \u2013 the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC)."

It has been in operation for 100 years, surviving one world war, six relocations and continuous expansion. The collection has been overseen by many scientists over the last century, and The Princess Royal visited recently as part of its centenary celebrations."

Its first 200 cultures \u2014 including Private Cable\u2019s \u2014 were deposited by Sir Frederick William Andrewes, a pathologist who studied dysentery throughout World War I."

Penicillin was developed as a therapeutic agent at Oxford University\u2019s Sir Willian Dunn School of Pathology in the late 1930s and early 1940s by a team that included Sir Alexander Fleming."

Today NCTC 6571 is still in use as an antibiotic sensitive control, helping to ensure that penicillin can fight the bacteria it targets."

            "text": "When we receive a new strain of bacteria, it is first taken to the NCTC lab and examined to establish the best way to grow it, then they are freeze dried for long-term preservation before undergoing quality checks, which ensures they are pure, viable and retain the original characteristics as described."

Genome sequencing is the process by which the entire DNA sequence of an organism is determined, and all the type strains preserved in the NCTC collection underwent this process."
