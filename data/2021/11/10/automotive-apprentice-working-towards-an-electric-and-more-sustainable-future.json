The work on his\u00a0level 6 apprenticeship at Jaguar Land Rover\u00a0involves moving away from fossil fuels towards electric vehicles. His apprenticeship has given him first-hand experience and a degree in engineering, and using all his new skills, he will help to create a greener future."

Luke\u2019s work as part of the advanced product creation team means he has had direct involvement in developing these technologies with a clear focus on sustainability, not just by electrification but also through the materials they use. A role which helps Luke see how his decisions can affect vehicles launched in the future."
