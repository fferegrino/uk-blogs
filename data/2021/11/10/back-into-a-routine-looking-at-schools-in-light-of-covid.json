While getting children back on track is no easy task, the effort is clearly well underway."

            "text": "To say that it\u2019s been a difficult 18 months for education would be putting it mildly. And the pandemic is still posing many challenges, so I don\u2019t think anyone would say we\u2019re out of the woods just yet. Some schools are still having to deal with COVID-related absences and are working hard to bridge the gap for children at home."

I appreciate this feels like a big step. But it\u2019s the right move \u2013 both for children, who\u2019ve missed out on so much, and for parents, who want some assurance about what\u2019s happening for their children."

We\u2019ve worked hard to adapt the education inspection framework (EIF) and train our inspectors so that we can inspect fairly and reliably this term, taking the full impact of COVID into account."

            "text": "Our expectation is that all inspections are grounded in a thorough understanding of the particular challenges a school has faced, and is still facing. So, we\u2019ll always ask leaders about the impact of COVID. This will help us understand the context for the school \u2013 though we\u2019ll only report on it in detail when we think it will help parents understand how a school is doing. So far this term, we\u2019re seeing many schools doing great work and we haven\u2019t needed to describe the COVID impact in detail."

And, if anything, it couldn\u2019t be more relevant than right now, as schools work so hard to get children back on track."

        {
            "text": "We still want to see schools offering an ambitious curriculum, with a broad range of subjects. But we understand that tough choices have been made during the pandemic about what to keep in and what to leave out. And in many schools, curriculums might not be fully realised, or might still be in transition. Inspectors will want to discuss the reasons why, and to understand what leaders are doing to get their curriculum where they want it to be. We\u2019re confident that our inspector training and ongoing checks will make sure we\u2019re getting underneath these issues."

            "text": "One of the biggest changes to inspection is, of course, the removal of the exemption from inspection for outstanding schools. It\u2019s natural that schools in the top bracket might feel a bit of unease at this change. But it\u2019s so important for children, and for parents, that we get a clear view of education in these schools. Some haven\u2019t been inspected in over a decade. Many children will have gone all the way through these schools without anyone making sure things are still going well."

        {
            "text": "This is a rebalancing exercise. Since 2010, there\u2019s been a one-way valve on the outstanding grade; once achieved, it would almost never be lost. That has meant we\u2019ve accumulated more and more outstanding schools over the years, so the current education picture is, in effect, skewed. When the exemption came in, about 1 in 10 schools were graded outstanding. Now, it\u2019s about 1 in 5. Removing the outstanding exemption will help give us an accurate and up-to-date picture."

            "text": "It\u2019s too early to estimate where we\u2019ll end up, but we\u2019re seeing that rebalancing start this term \u2013 particularly because we\u2019re focusing on the schools that we haven\u2019t inspected for a long time. A large number aren\u2019t retaining their outstanding grade, which is to be expected. But this doesn\u2019t mean that these aren\u2019t good schools \u2013 the vast majority are, and parents should be pleased to send their children to them."
        },
        {
            "text": "It\u2019s also important to stress that this isn\u2019t to do with COVID. We haven\u2019t inspected these schools in so long that it\u2019s impossible to tell when a decline in standards might have happened. Indeed, some schools may have seen a drop in standards several years ago, and are now improving again. So it\u2019s important not to view the loss of an outstanding grade too negatively."
        },
        {
            "text": "As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re committed to taking the pandemic into account properly and sensitively to make sure changes in grade aren\u2019t the result of COVID pressures. Schools are retaining their outstanding grade during the pandemic, which is great to see. Others are being graded outstanding for the first time, and we\u2019re also seeing many requires improvement or inadequate schools achieving higher grades."

        {
            "text": "Ultimately, we recognise the huge efforts that schools are making to give pupils the education and support they need through the pandemic. We know that there are still challenges ahead, but everything I\u2019ve seen tells me that children are in good hands. Children only get one chance at school, and this cohort have already had their education severely disrupted. It\u2019s up to all of us working in the sector, including Ofsted, to make sure that their education is as good as it can be."
