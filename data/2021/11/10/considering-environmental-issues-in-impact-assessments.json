This has highlighted the importance, both domestically and internationally, of climate change and the global action required when it comes to the environment. As part of the international efforts to reduce global warming, the UK has committed to achieving Net Zero by 2050, i.e. by that date, all UK greenhouse gas emissions would be balanced by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."

Therefore, identifying and assessing environmental impacts consistently across all areas of government, including regulatory proposals, will become increasingly important. This blog post looks at the current regulatory system in the UK and how it deals with environmental impacts, and how the Better Regulation Framework (BRF) could help us to understand the environmental impacts of new regulations to assist in achieving Net Zero."

It does not say how the environmental impacts of proposals should be assessed and does not provide for a similar measure of the total environmental cost of the regulations that are introduced each year."

The need to consider wider environmental impacts is underpinned by the HMT Green Book guidance on policy appraisal. All regulatory proposals that are expected to have an environmental impact require a proportionate assessment of these impacts in the IA submission."

However, we comment on wider impacts and whether the evidence provided on these aspects is sufficient to support decision-making. We currently use a single \u201cquality indicator\u201d (\u2018good\u2019, \u2018satisfactory\u2019, \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019) to summarise the quality and robustness of the evidence and analysis on wider impacts collectively."

It is not possible to quantify all of these environmental impacts, let alone to capture them in a single metric although it would be possible to capture a range of measures in a scorecard. We consider regulatory IAs but it is also worth noting that, environmental impact assessments may also be required for development and infrastructure projects."

There are several guidance documents available to policymakers and analysts to support them in assessing and quantifying environmental impacts. They include the HM Treasury\u2019s Green Book supplementary guidance on \u2018climate change and environmental valuation\u2019 and \u2018valuation of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 for appraisal and DEFRA\u2019s guidance on \u2018valuing environmental impacts\u2019 and \u2018enabling a natural capital approach\u2019."

            "text": "COP26 has focused attention on the 2050 Net Zero commitment \u2013 which the UK was the first to enshrine in law - and tackling climate change. This creates a strong case for assessing the impact on CO2 equivalent emissions in IAs. The Government\u2019s recently closed consultation on reforming the BRF sought views on ways to assess the wider impacts of regulation including environmental impacts. This provides an opportunity for the BRF to assist in ensuring that our climate change objectives and commitments are adequately taken into account when considering new regulatory measures."

            "text": "IAs could highlight the choices and trade-offs that are necessary for measures that improve the environment but have a cost to businesses, or that improve consumer welfare but have an unintended adverse impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and so assist and inform government decision making. The framework could also provide transparency over the cumulative impact of new regulations on the environment to support the achievement of Net Zero. We look forward to the Government\u2019s conclusions on the way forward."
