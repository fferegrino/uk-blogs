I have the freedom to carry out this role as part of my full-time job."

            "text": "I\u2019m Italian, so not being a British citizen meant I also had some added hurdles to overcome. I never admitted this openly at work, but not having my family close to me added to an almost unsustainable amount of stress and anxiety. It was a real struggle at that time, but I also knew that everyone was doing all they could to help me. Despite that, I want whoever reads this to know it was all worth it and I would do it again, ten times over if needs be, to get to where I am now. I had everything to gain and nothing to lose by becoming my real self."

She has been an incredible ally, both practically by going through each step of the process with me and emotionally as I went through this remarkable journey. She\u2019ll probably read this and tell you she doesn\u2019t deserve this much recognition, but she does!"

I\u2019ll never forget the day I told her my intention to transition, expecting to have to argue my case to start the procedure at work and \u2018justify myself\u2019, but that never happened. She simply listened to what I had to say and said \u201cOkay, so what do you need us to do now? Let me know if there is anything I can do.\u201d"

When I came back it was an early-August morning I\u2019ll never forget. My inbox was flooded with messages of support. I\u2019ve saved them all in a special folder."

We often ran quizzes at the beginning of online meetings to keep in touch and remain positive, despite all that was happening. I think everyone felt the impact of the restrictions and we were all aware that being kind and showing understanding was the only way to go."

            "text": "Often being trans means you need to become your own GP, therapist, lawyer, and secretary. It\u2019s like having another full-time job, phone calls and emails included. On this note if you need help with understanding how being an immigrant and transitioning fit together, please get in touch with me, I\u2019d love to help and my personal experience may be useful."

There\u2019s guidance, policies and set procedures to help people like us through this incredible, crazy, scary, and rewarding journey. And there are plenty of amazing supportive people here. This has helped me to feel happy, and everyone deserves to feel happy."

I\u2019ve visited the pages and think they\u2019re clear and complete. For more support there are networks such DWP Pride, the DWP LGBT+ staff network, and outside of DWP there\u2019s a:gender that can help with navigating the process, both in practice and emotionally."
