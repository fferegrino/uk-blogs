This includes the conservation of some of the islands\u2019 native ecosystems, which provide habitats for rare and threatened species including sea lions, Magellanic penguins, and the tussac-bird and Cobb\u2019s wren."

            "text": "Middle Island, like its neighbour Green Island, was once covered in the endemic tussac grass. A hardy plant that grows in large clumps, often more than two metres high and almost as wide, it once covered shoreline landscapes across the Falkland Islands."

        {
            "text": "With the introduction of sheep to the islands, the sweet and nutritious tussac grass was ripe for destruction. A combination of over-grazing and damage caused by fires pushed the tussac coverage on Middle Island past a critical point and it began to die back. When tussac cover is removed, it exposes the soil underneath. This is usually peat, which is quickly dried by the incessant winds, turning it to a coarse, barren dust. Picked up by the same winds, this dust then chokes all nearby plant life, further weakening the regional ecosystem."

A \u2018tiller\u2019 is a section of tussac grass that is formed as a whole and can be safely removed from the larger clump without damaging it or the remainder of the plant."

            "text": "This replanting work is of vital importance as currently only 1% of the Falklands\u2019 778 islands are considered intact tussac habitats. Through the collaborative efforts of Falklands Conservation and personnel from the BFSAI Conservation Group and DIO, an area of approximately 200 by 50 metres was planted each day."

            "text": "Previous years have seen a re-growth success rate of well over 80%. If this year\u2019s plants match that survival rate, the vast majority of the eroded northern shore of the island will be protected against further erosion. Continued efforts over the next two years will complete the work to replant the barren areas, helping to re-establish an ecosystem that supports a wide range of wildlife species."
