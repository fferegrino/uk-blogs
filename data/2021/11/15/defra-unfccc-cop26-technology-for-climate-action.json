            "text": "During the event in Glasgow, attended by close to 2000 stakeholders, CEOs and senior leaders from a range of technology companies came together to discuss how they could best help reduce the harmful impact industrialisation is having on the environment. Most of the companies in attendance could agree that the climate challenge could not be solved in isolation. The tech industry decided to collaborate and hold itself to account through transparency and reporting. Many businesses agreed to a 1.5-degree pathway of reducing emissions by 2050 and sooner (e.g. 2040, 2030 and 2025 for many companies there)."
