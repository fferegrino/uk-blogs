She noted there were few incidents of bullying, but there was a mismatch in knowledge and understanding around bullying and the extent to which it can affect people\u2019s lives. Therefore, we knew we needed to find an approach that included everyone, provided clear direction, and upskilled both staff and pupils to address it now and in the future."

Before the launch of Anti-Bullying Week, all staff participated in professional development through inset training and completing the Anti-Bullying Alliance\u2019s online modules. They were trained in facilitating resolution circles, emotion coaching and active listening. We viewed tackling bullying, just like supporting any other subject or area of safeguarding."

            "text": "The policy includes strategies to prevent bullying and typical response strategies. In English lessons, we have used quality texts in each class, to explore different bullying themes and bring the policy to life. A challenge we faced was exploring the difference between retaliation, revenge, and self-defence. To do this, pupils explored the definitions and learned to defend against bullying in an appropriate and safe way. As a result, pupils feel empowered and more confident in preventing and responding to bullying."

The message to pupils and parents is that we take every incident seriously and by keeping a record, planning for intervention, and monitoring, we can prevent similar incidents from happening again."

Pupils now have the knowledge and understanding to know when something is not right and how to resolve situations themselves. Pupils\u2019 behaviour towards each other has become more empathetic and inclusive \u2013 showing an understanding that difference is to be celebrated. Our pupils are happier in school knowing that we fully support any bullying concerns raised."
