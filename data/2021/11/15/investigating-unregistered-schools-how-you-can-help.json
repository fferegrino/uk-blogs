This limits their future choices and, if left unaddressed, will have profound consequences for the thousands of children who attend these institutions."

            "text": "An unregistered school is an educational establishment that meets the legal definition of an independent (private) school, but is not registered with the DfE. It\u2019s against the law to run an independent school unless it\u2019s registered with the DfE, which is the regulating body for this kind of school. In fact, anyone who runs an unregistered school is guilty of a criminal offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both."

            "text": "Unfortunately, legislation has not kept up with the reality on the ground. Institutions have learned how to operate on the cusp of the law by exploiting loopholes, while government\u2019s ability to regulate them effectively continues to lag behind. This means that in some cases, these places operate in plain sight."

But we need the support of the public too. "
