Translated into codes of conduct across the public sector, they also extend to private companies where taxpayers\u2019 money is being spent."

The wider context of social media, globalisation, political polarisation \u2013 even before EU Exit and the pandemic \u2013 bring new and different ethical challenges."

My committee believes it is time to place more of the ethics regulators dealing with ministerial interests, public appointments and business appointments for former office holders onto a statutory footing giving them clearer accountability and greater independence from the executive they regulate \u2013 bringing arrangements in government closer to those found in the best parts of the private sector."
