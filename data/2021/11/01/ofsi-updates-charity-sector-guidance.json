These sanctions come from United Nations (UN) resolutions, and the UK has an obligation to implement and enforce them. A number of individuals and entities, including members of the Taliban are subject to UN sanctions. The UK has not implemented sanctions against the Taliban as an entity and in the absence of an applicable derogation in the relevant UN resolution, the UK is unable to grant a humanitarian licence."

We appreciate at these difficult times there may be barriers to this delivery but recognise that now more than ever efforts are needed in the region to prevent a worsening humanitarian crisis."

OFSI values early reporting and will take this into account when considering any enforcement action. We treat each suspected breach on its own merits. We assess the facts of each case to decide an outcome that is fair and proportionate. We will take mitigating factors into account when deciding how to proceed with a case, which may reduce a penalty we impose or lead us not to take enforcement action."

We will shortly be conducting a webinar with the Charity Commission of England and Wales targeted at charities operating in high-risk jurisdictions, such as Afghanistan, to help provide some clarity on challenging issues. This will include a short Q&A to take questions."
