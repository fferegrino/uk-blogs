But they have one thing in common: they are run by a board of trustees, a group of individuals who take ultimate responsibility for everything that happens in the charity, and who make sure the charity delivers on its purpose and mission."

Trusteeship can open doors for people, and young people, people of colour, women, and those from different educational background or regions of the country should have access to that opportunity."

            "text": "It is also a risk to good governance. Having a diverse group of people on their boards \u2013 in terms of background and experience, but also in outlook and personality \u2013 helps charities make better decisions. Diverse boards are better able to anticipate and manage risks, seize new opportunities, future proof their organisations and tackle difficult but necessary decisions. Conversely, boards that lack the right mix of skills, experience and perspectives, that do not test and challenge decisions or ideas, are more at risk of \u2018groupthink\u2019 and of losing their way."

            "text": "We would like to see charities do more to attract and welcome new types of trustees to their organisations. One simple step is to always advertise and recruit openly when positions become available. At the moment, too many new trustees are recruited informally, through existing networks, which risks perpetuating a trustee \u2018monoculture\u2019."

It\u2019s not easy \u2013 often its hugely challenging \u2013 but it offers an opportunity to make a difference for the cause you care about and it can offer experience of leadership that can be attractive to future employers."

Take the trustee quiz to find out what skills you bring to your board, and encourage your colleagues on your board to do the same, and to discuss the outcomes at your next board meeting. Or use the opportunity to refresh your knowledge on all the trustee essentials in our easy-read 5-minute guides."
