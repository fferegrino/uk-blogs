We have recently launched a consultation on banning a range of single-use plastics, including plastic cutlery, plates, balloon sticks, and expanded and extruded polystyrene food and beverage containers, while our call for evidence is seeking views on tackling a number of commonly littered single-use plastics, including wet wipes, cigarette filters, sachets, and other single-use cups."

We have also launched a consultation on creating consistent recycling collections in England, which will transform the way we deal with rubbish."

The charge was recently increased to 10p and extended to all retailers, a move which is expected to take billions more bags out of circulation."

This will encourage greater use of recycled plastic, leading to increased levels of recycling and plastic waste collection, helping to tackle the problem of plastic waste and protect our environment."
