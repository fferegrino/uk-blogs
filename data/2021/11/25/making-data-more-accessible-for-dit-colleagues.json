            "text": "SQL is extremely powerful. In addition to the filtering example above, SQL queries can sort and aggregate data and join different datasets together."

            "text": "For example, extremely large datasets can be queried with SQL quicker than what is typically possible with a spreadsheet. If you have read-only permissions for the data, which is the case for Data Workspace users, it\u2019s difficult to accidentally make changes."

            "text": "By querying a single remote data source such as Data Workspace, you avoid having multiple copies of the same data. This allows teams members to be sure that they are all looking at the same thing. The data can also be updated separately from the query, so the same analysis can be easily performed on the latest version. The data and query separation means SQL queries are reviewable compared to the difficulty of quality-assuring a chain of formulas in spreadsheet cells."

            "text": "Finally, SQL allows for better governance. You can avoid storing data locally or it being emailed, and permissions can be granted or revoked as needed to individual datasets. This is especially important for datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII)."

            "text": "From the beginning of Data Workspace, almost all of its tools have supported SQL. However, many of these have high barriers to entry. Some require the knowledge of another language such as Python or R, some have inaccessible interfaces, and some are designed more for technical maintenance, rather than analysis."
        },
        {
            "text": "So, in 2020 the Data Infrastructure team at DIT developed Data Explorer for our colleagues to use internally. Data Explorer is a browser-based tool leveraging the GOV.UK Design System, allowing users to quickly and easily query data in Data Workspace using SQL."

            "text": "Data Explorer\u2019s design puts the ability to enter and run queries right up front, a feature that is surprisingly missing from many other tools that support SQL. Example queries are also placed on pages throughout the Data Workspace catalogue, with buttons that pre-fill the query into Data Explorer ready to edit and run."

            "text": "Previous queries are available in Data Explorer for longer-term projects, and through Data Explorer they can be shared with colleagues to help collaboration. It\u2019s more accessible because it\u2019s easier to use."
