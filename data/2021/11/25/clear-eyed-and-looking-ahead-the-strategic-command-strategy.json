            "text": "Quite rightly, Strategic Command was looked to as the organisation which would be the driving force for that integration. Our experience of collaborating with partners across government in areas such as cyber and space; working with international allies and partners on operations; and the critical cross-Defence enabling functions we perform such as intelligence, medical, logistics, and digital technology; placed us in the vanguard to lead that change. \u00a0"

To communicate what we needed to do, and how we were to do it, we needed a clear strategy. However, despite being an organisation with a strategic focus, developing that strategy was no easy feat. \u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our unique structure and broad remit created many challenges in developing a strategy. We needed to ensure we stayed true to the direction given in the IR, but we also needed to face the realities of our existing organisation. Most critically, we needed to ensure we had a clear vision. To do this we looked to who we are as an organisation, and to what had been asked of us. \u00a0"

            "text": "Next, we considered what outcomes we must achieve in order to reach that vision. In determining what these should be, we began by considering the objectives of our Multi-Domain Integration Change Programme (MDICP). We started here because we knew that it was critical that our strategy objectives aligned with the objectives of the MDICP. \u00a0"

            "text": "With that in mind, we developed five strategic outcomes that we had to achieve. They are: integrated capabilities, orchestrated activity and effects, improved understanding, enhanced global reach, and disruptive capabilities. By achieving these outcomes, we\u2019ll help contribute towards integrated Armed Forces that can act in ways that our adversaries cannot match.\u00a0"

We quickly realised that, in order to achieve our objectives, we were going to have to make some changes to key capabilities within the Command. These key capabilities were the things we determined must be transformed across the Command in order to create a more agile, capable and integrated Defence. They are; people, data, technology, and authority.\u00a0"

We are now armed with a strategy which sets out what Strategic Command must do in order to lead this crucial period of change in UK defence. But a strategy is only as good as those who can implement it.\u00a0 \u00a0"
