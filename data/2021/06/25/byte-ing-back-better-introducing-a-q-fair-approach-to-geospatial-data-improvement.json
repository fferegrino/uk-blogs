Building on the work of the geospatial Data Improvement Programme, the Commission is now launching its Q-FAIR benchmarking process that will drive and track progress across the public sector to make better location data available to more people. This blog is the first in a series that sets out the successes and lessons of the Data Improvement Programme, which the Commission has run in conjunction with its six Partner Bodies, and its Q-FAIR ambitions for the future.\u00a0 \u00a0"

Using this approach also emphasised the importance of, before you do anything else, ensuring the data is of appropriate Quality and is fit for purpose.
