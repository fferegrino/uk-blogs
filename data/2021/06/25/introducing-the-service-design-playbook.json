It's the collective knowledge and experience of many of the service designers at the Ministry of Justice brought together to support other designers across the organisation."

            "text": "One of my favourite descriptions of service design is working with users and delivering services, and there are many frameworks and processes that exist in helping us achieve this.\u00a0 The double-diamond method and the Stanford school design thinking process are just a couple of the ones out there."

While, as designers, we might not follow a set procedure in government, we have the frameworks in the GOV.UK Service Manual and the Service Standard that acts as a great starting point in understanding the mechanics of creating and running good public services.

We\u2019re reminded on a daily basis that design is always political. Prisoners and people on probation serve a sentence rather than choose to use a service. Between their needs and those of the general public, our staff and our members of parliament - it\u2019s not always easy to know which user lays at the heart of our designs and who the service is really for.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Whilst the\u00a0 Digital, Data and Technology capability framework is a helpful introduction to all the professions and disciplines, I recognised the gap in guidance of how these disciplines worked best together to design the service end-to-end. There are seven roles within the user-centred design family and most designers often wear many (multi-disciplined) hats. So, where did the role of a service designer fit amongst all of our wonderful disciplines? Furthermore, how do we describe our part to our team members?\u00a0"

Only by convincing the team to spend time and energy in the process, do we encourage them to take it with us."
