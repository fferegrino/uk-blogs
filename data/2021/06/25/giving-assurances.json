This was exciting and really moving, especially as everyone had been working together for more than a year to protect and support people. This felt like a real turning point in the fight against coronavirus."

The partnership\u2019s approach is always to look for different ways to tackle an issue and evolve the response. This has led to the development of a new process where any positive tests are treated as variants of concern. All positives are sent off to labs for genome sequencing."
