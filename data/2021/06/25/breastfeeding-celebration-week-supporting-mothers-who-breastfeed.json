The emotional and practical help can make a huge difference to the breastfeeding experience and opportunity to bond with the new baby."

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises that breastfeeding is a natural process, however it is not always easy and the support to new mothers; family and friends can make a huge difference.\u00a0 We hope Breastfeeding celebration week provides an opportunity for mothers, partners, families and healthcare professionals to come together to share what works to support breastfeeding."

            "text": "Breast milk is the ideal food for newborns and infants, supplying all the nutrients they need for healthy development. It contains antibodies that help protect infants from common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and supports a healthy weight in children. The WHO recognise that children and adolescents who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight or obese. Additionally, children who are breastfed generally engage more with education. There are numerous benefits for women who breastfeed, for example a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers."

            "text": "Despite the well documented benefits of breastfeeding and a national ambition to increase breastfeeding rates, within the UK we still have some of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world. Eight out of ten women in the UK stop breastfeeding before they want to. If we as health care professionals, and as a society, are serious about improving breastfeeding rates and supporting women to do so we need to understand why this is the case."

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advise that there are no specific safety concerns identified with any COVID-19 vaccines in relation to pregnancy, but there is a preference that pregnant women have the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines as there is more data on them from the US. The latest Government advice is that pregnant women should be offered COVID-19 vaccines at the same time as people of the same age or risk group, and there\u2019s no requirement to stop breastfeeding in order to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The\u00a0JCVI\u00a0has recommended that the COVID-19 vaccines can be received whilst breastfeeding."

They are effective at enabling new mothers to start and continue breastfeeding and can support them to make informed feeding choices. They are also skilled at including partners and making sure they are involved in the baby\u2019s care giving. Information for healthcare professionals can be accessed on the High Impact Areas website for early years, and the interactive Breastfeeding Townscape. Peer support and helplines are also available, such as the\u00a0National Breastfeeding Helpline."

Start for Life provides parents and parents-to-be with trusted NHS advice on pregnancy, early years and breastfeeding, which health professionals can signpost to new mothers."

PHE\u2019s Breastfeeding Friend (BFF) from Start4Life is designed to help. This tool, together with the range of support materials from Start4Life, can provide breastfeeding information at any time of night or day and support mothers, their partners and families through the challenges they may face."
