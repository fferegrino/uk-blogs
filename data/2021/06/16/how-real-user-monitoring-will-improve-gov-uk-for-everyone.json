            "text": "There are 2 types of website performance testing: synthetic and Real User Monitoring (RUM). Synthetic testing is when parameters are set, such as browser or device used, and then the test is run continually. For example, these tests are run daily on GOV.UK. In contrast, RUM measures the actual performance of a page from actual user devices."
        },
        {
            "text": "While synthetic is helpful for spotting performance regressions and then verifying they are fixed, unless we have a user who specifically matches the parameters we set out, the results are just estimates as to how the site performs for them."
        },
        {
            "text": "However, when testing with RUM, the anonymous performance data gives us insights into a user's experience when they visit GOV.UK. No personal data is captured in this process, and the data is only collected when a user has given consent to the use of cookies on GOV.UK for analytics purposes."

            "text": "Although anonymous performance data from a user can be helpful in terms of how they experienced GOV.UK and any problems they faced while accessing the content they needed, the real power of this data comes from its aggregate form."
        },
        {
            "text": "A large dataset gives us direct insight into how the site is performing for everyone. This is a great thing because every user is visiting GOV.UK for different reasons. Some may be looking to complete an important life task like registering a birth, marriage or death, while others are looking for guidance on buying a fishing licence."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is simply impossible to test a website of GOV.UK\u2019s size (it hosts half a million pages) using all possible device, browser, and connection combinations. By effectively crowdsourcing this performance data, one user\u2019s poor experience gives us the information we need to understand the reasons why that happened, and thereby improve future experiences for all users. It is very important that we keep striving for better performance in the government service space. Here\u2019s why it matters."

            "text": "GOV.UK has a responsibility to ensure that our content is easily accessible to everyone, no matter what their device, connection speed, or where and how they choose to access it. Accessibility is also a legal requirement for public sector organisations, with regulations in place to ensure compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA. In the case of GOV.UK, the team aims to meet the standard and go beyond it."
        },
        {
            "text": "But what often isn\u2019t considered is how web performance is also a barrier to entry for users. It is in fact a type of accessibility if you take the word at face value: the ability to \u2018access\u2019 data. The quality and optimisation of frontend code is an important factor in the overall experience a user has on a service. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve written about \u2018Why we focus on frontend performance' previously."
        },
        {
            "text": "It would be wrong for us to assume that all users have access to a high-specification device, an unlimited data plan and a stable connection. There are many users in the UK that are on older devices, or on a limited data plan. There\u2019s also data that shows that some people may even struggle to get a connection at all in some rural areas in the UK."

This plan gives users just 1.9GB of data per month. Given the median mobile page weight across the web is almost 1.9MB, this data allowance does not allow for much browsing."
