This exciting programme of change means we've been recruiting people to help us, with more new roles emerging over the life of the programme. These roles are critical in helping us shape the way we'll manage our site and services as we exit the current PFI contract."

DVLA will be one of the first to exit a PFI contract following closely behind DWP and HMRC, the first two central government bodies to go through the expiry process. We'll be working with the Infrastructure and Projects Authority, the government\u2019s centre of expertise for infrastructure and major projects, to take forward any lessons learned from the exit of the PFI contracts."
