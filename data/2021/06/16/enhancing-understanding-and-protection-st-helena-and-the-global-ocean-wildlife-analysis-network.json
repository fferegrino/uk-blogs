Watching the science influence and be translated into management measures that will better conserve and protect our marine environment embodies our pride even more.\u00a0But there is still that wonder \u2013 what do we really know about these environments?"

Further identification and behavioural observations on elasmobranchs (such as sharks and other large predators) and other charismatic megafauna will also further our existing protection strategies for these species. These BRUVS also remove the need for a physical human presence, which opens up a whole new level of science preciously not afforded to the island."

This data crucially will be collected in a way that is consistent, comparable and statistically robust both locally and internationally.\u00a0The ability to repeat recording again and again enables us to build on and monitor our baselines. Sharing this information internationally also provides an incredible opportunity to learn more about the same or similar species found elsewhere in the world."

Partnering with other on island organisations such as the St Helena National Trust to deploy the BRUVS will increase the amount of information that can be captured, and also helps ensure the protection of the islands marine environment is a community effort."

The BRUVS are a great addition to our scientific toolkit, and we can\u2019t wait to get them in the water and hit record."
