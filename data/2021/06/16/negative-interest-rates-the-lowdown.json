            "text": "As an example of the distinction between the 2 rates, if the nominal interest rate is 3% per annum (the rate at which you can lend and borrow money) and the inflation rate is 2% per annum (the rate at which your purchasing power erodes in response to price increases), then the 'real rate' of interest would be 3% - 2% = 1%."

            "text": "When the interest rate is close to 0% or negative, the bank still needs to offer a greater value in the future than the amount deposited today for this to be an attractive service. To cover the costs of providing the positive rate to lenders while the Bank Rate is zero or negative, banks may need to increase or introduce additional charges and reduce the rates they offer for savings accounts."

            "text": "It was long believed that in this scenario, there would be a mass shift to cash. Instead, what we have seen is that, while current rates are close to 0% (0.1% at time of publishing), the convenience of not withdrawing our cash means we are likely to continue depositing it in banks."

        {
            "text": "It could also be the case that even a negative rate of interest is still a greater rate than alternative rates offered elsewhere. In effect, while the rate is close to zero, a small shift in either direction has negligible impact to the monetary value. There is, however, a limit to how negative the rate can get before this puts unmanageable financial strain on the economy."

Rate reductions, such as the way the current Bank Rate was set in response to the coronavirus pandemic, are a common method used by central banks to incentivise spending. Negative rates are an extension of this policy."

The BoE has never set negative rates however this has been seen elsewhere including Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the eurozone."

As with any rate reduction, negative rates would make it cheaper to borrow and less rewarding to save."

In Germany, where some banks have started charging for deposits over \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000), some people are now keeping their money in vaults instead."

            "text": "Negative rates could also have an unusual consequence for mortgage and loan repayments meaning that the loan outstanding would reduce more quickly. However, most UK mortgages are on a fixed interest rate so repayments would be unchanged. Even in the case of variable rates, these are unlikely to be drastically reduced and may be limited by the terms and conditions of the mortgage."
