As part of this, the DfE also confirmed that lead providers delivering the ECF and NPQs would be inspected by Ofsted, to make sure schools and teachers are getting the best possible support."

It will be aligned with our EIF and ITE inspection frameworks, and we\u2019ll be talking to stakeholders as we develop our approach. We expect inspections to begin in spring 2022."

However, we\u2019ll also be engaging with teachers on the programmes, mentors, and a sample of delivery partners (for example, multi-academy trusts and teaching schools hubs) to help inform our assessment of a lead provider."

High-quality continuous professional development is good for school leaders and teachers. But most importantly, it\u2019s good for pupils. And as everyone works hard to get children back on track, this couldn\u2019t be more important."
