The announcement of Tristan da Cunha\u2019s new Marine Protection Zone (MPZ) brought the programme over its target of protecting four million square kilometres of ocean. While this milestone target has been achieved, there is still much more to do to ensure the protection of these diverse environments, and so the programme will continue to work to build on this success during the coming year."

That is why the government is calling upon the global community to work with the UK to protect 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030. In working towards this target, the UK Government is committed to taking significant steps to protect the rich biodiversity within its marine environments. The Blue Belt Programme demonstrates the major role that small, remote islands can have in achieving global change, and its continuation into 2021 \u2013 2022 reflects the UK Governments ongoing ambition and commitment."
