The game imagined the dystopian future of 2052 in which humankind\u2019s capabilities could be enhanced through nanotechnology, pushing the boundaries of what a person could ordinarily do."

            "text": "Two decades later, another video game company, CD Projekt Red, released one of the most highly-anticipated games of all time: \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d. Like Deus Ex, the game imagined a world only 50 years from now in which nearly all of humankind has embraced the enhancement capabilities of merging the human with the machine, also known as Human Augmentation."

In that future we\u2019ll be able to think and act faster, compute and exploit massive amounts of data with ease, and command physical force many times greater than even the world\u2019s strongest people."

If he\u2019s to be believed then the benefits of Human Augmentation are huge.\u00a0 He\u2019s publicly stated he believes that computer chips implanted into the human brain could one day be used to help cure conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s or Dementia."

A pig named Gertrude had a chip approximately the size of a coin implanted directly into her brain which was used to monitor her neural activity. More recently, Neuralink released a 3 minute video of a macaque called Pager playing the classic game Pong against its own mind via their technology."

Indeed, some the greatest technological developments were often made as a necessity of war, or in one nation\u2019s efforts to outpace their opponents. The Cold War\u2019s Space Race is great example of this."

For each new piece of hardware or software developed, there becomes a new way to seek to exploit it for a military advantage. British Defence is currently working hard to make sure that we can use technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and to properly exploit sources of data to create and maintain a military advantage."

        {
            "text": "Why? Because other nations are already doing so. By their nature, cyber-attacks are difficult to pin onto a specific actor, something called attribution, but in recent years cyber-attacks attributed to countries such as Iran and Russia have been reported in the media.\u00a0 Most recently, the Solar Winds hacks of a number of US government departments, uncovered in late 2020, has been attributed by US security agencies to APT29, a division of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service."

Well, whilst cyber warfare and Human Augmentation are different, the idea is the same: those that can use this technology have the advantage over those that cannot or will not. Britain is already working hard to make sure we keep up with our adversaries in Cyber, and it could be even more dangerous if we get left behind in Human Augmentation technology."
