Since then, we have spoken to service teams, conducted research, run workshops, updated guidance, and recently become part of a new organisation \u2013 the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). This blog post gives an overview of what we have done in the past 6 months, why we did it and what\u2019s next."

To do that most effectively, we reviewed the different ways users can give us feedback and improved our processes for responding to that feedback. We\u2019ve also analysed thousands of feedback comments, matched them to existing knowledge and created a prioritised backlog of things to fix or investigate further."

This means we need to interact with them differently which increases the complexity of our work."

User research has shown that readers trust guidance less if it has an old \u2018last updated\u2019 date. However, the guidance has generally not been updated because it is still accurate. And having this date at the top of Service Manual pages can distract users from useful guidance."

We\u2019re also looking at other options, like updating the \u2018last updated\u2019 date when a page is reviewed or has minor updates.
