The MMO however is not responsible for the regulation of the day to day functioning and activities of port and harbour authorities."

The Harbour Order also enables a restricted zone to be established under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990. The restricted zone would temporarily limit access to the waters adjoining the area around where the G7 Summit is to be held in order to provide additional security to the attending world leaders."
