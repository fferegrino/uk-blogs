I am a joy to live with! So, if I agree (which I do) that clean hands and appropriate laundry and waste management are good things, why do I need to be nagged and why hasn\u2019t nagging worked?"

The recently launched Every Action Counts Toolkit provides some ideas for us to keep messages fresh and promote good practice."

We are working in people\u2019s homes and converted properties and have all the difficulties inherent with these.\u00a0 We need to involve everyone in seeking solutions to infection control challenges and provide the resources to enable these challenges to be met so we can have confidence in our preventative measures."

It can be used to start a conversation and start your thinking of how you can continue your excellence journey and ask the question, \u2018What can I do better?\u2019"

We can find multiple ways of enthusing and reiterating infection prevention messages and not just repeat ourselves to the groan of others. We can involve everyone and respect their ability to explore solutions to infection control problems in their own work. You never know, I may even place my socks in the laundry basket without being asked!"
