            "text": "We celebrate Pride Month every June to recognise the progress made for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT+) people, as well as marking the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. In June of 1969, a police raid of the Stonewall Inn, a gay club in New York, resulted in a six-day movement led by Marsha P. Johnson, demanding the LGBT+ community were given a safe space to be open with their sexual orientation. The following year, the very first Pride Month was established and it is now observed annually by LGBT+ people and allies globally."

Harry Price is a Team Leader within Customer Services, who has worked for us for almost 6 years and is an LGBT+ champion at our organisation. We spoke to Harry to gain an understanding of his experiences, as a gay person, working at HMRC and what Pride really means to him."

            "text": "HMRC is a really diverse workforce in lots of different respects. I\u2019ve seen support for various forms of diversity, including sexual orientation and different genders and it\u2019s fantastic. The big initiative I\u2019m aware of at HMRC is called the Prism network. It\u2019s a network for anyone that identifies with LGBT+ and allies too. A prism is not only symbolic but is also representative of the network; it is something with many different sides, as well as the rainbow prisms form when refracting the light. The network brings attention to work related matters impacted by LGBT+ issues. It hosts events with speakers and stalls to let you know what\u2019s happening within the community throughout the year. For instance, across June, they\u2019ve hosted a series of virtual events such as HIV Awareness and Visibility, and positive stories from the LGBT+ Network."

            "text": "Part of being a Prism member means you wear a rainbow lanyard and it shows people that you are a visible role model from the LGBT+ community or are an ally passionate about creating and maintaining an inclusive organisation. \u00a0Lots of people wear them. From my own experience people who are trans, different sexual orientations and allies wear them and it\u2019s a really interesting and gratifying experience for me."

I\u2019ve been able to hold seminars on LGBT+ and homophobia in the workplace. One of my favourite things about working here is the opportunity to learn about different people. I really enjoy getting to know people different from myself in life and in the workplace."

I think it\u2019s important to see it\u2019s not an exclusive party, it\u2019s an opportunity to bring people together and show support."

I\u2019ve tried to champion things for smaller parts of the community such as LGBT+ people of ethnic minorities, that\u2019s been a big focus for me."

Things are not as linear as people may assume, it\u2019s important to be open minded and continue to be eager to develop and evolve."
