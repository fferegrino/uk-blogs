Will it be hard to decide which bank to switch to, or which type of current account is right for you? Will there be a lot of admin, phone calls and paperwork involved? Or will it be more difficult to access financial services such as loans? These are all questions you could be asking yourself."

Active switching drives competition between banks so that they try harder to come up with innovative, good value products and top-quality services that match your needs. This increases the choice and value available to you and makes switching even easier as banks compete to attract customers."
