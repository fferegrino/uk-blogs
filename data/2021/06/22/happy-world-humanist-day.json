            "text": "In fact, the history of humanism goes back hundreds of years (or thousands, if you read classicist Tim Whitmarsh) when sadly non-religious people were often viewed negatively. This was reflected by the pejorative words to describe non-religious individuals such as \u2018infidel\u2019 or \u2018blasphemer\u2019. Yet back in the 19th century, the non-religious would adopt these names as a badge of\u00a0 pride. They would often be used ironically to advertise events or in publications as non-religious people campaigned for some important rights that we today take for granted."

            "text": "For example, it wasn\u2019t until 1888 that it was possible to take a seat in Parliament or testify in court without swearing an oath to God as a non-religious person. You could still affirm before then if your religious belief didn\u2019t allow you to swear oaths. Most famously, this bar prevented the Northampton MP Charles Bradlaugh from taking his seat after he was elected in 1880."
