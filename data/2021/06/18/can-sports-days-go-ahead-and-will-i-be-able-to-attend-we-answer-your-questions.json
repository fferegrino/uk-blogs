This means that while schools and colleges will be able to hold the traditional end of term sports day, they may be slightly different than in previous years for both pupils and their parents."

Any spectators must stick to social distancing requirements and legal gathering limits where, outdoors, spectators can gather in separate groups of up to 30. This means, dependent on the size of the area available, multiple groups of 30 could theoretically attend events as long as there is no mixing between groups at any stage."
