As infections soared around the world, we set up the SIREN study to start looking for answers to some of the most important questions about reinfection and the impact of antibodies."

Participants are tested every 2-4 weeks using both PCR and antibody tests. All in the interest of answering the questions that we and the public need to know."

This helped us to assess the effectiveness of vaccines."

Incredible numbers showing us that the way out of the pandemic was to vaccinate. It also showed us that individuals who were vaccinated had a milder illness and were more likely to have infections without symptoms."
