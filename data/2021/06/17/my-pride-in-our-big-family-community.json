At the heart of this celebration is the concept of community, something which all of us can appreciate given the events of the past 12 months."

In this role, I have had the pleasure of working with talented, knowledgeable and interesting colleagues from across data, strategy, operational and legal teams; and in this time I have begun fully to appreciate what was first mentioned to me as a new starter: that HM Land Registry feels like one big family community."

I first discovered the network some months ago and delved in to the message boards providing access to opportunities for training and development. While the group is relatively small in number, it is big in motivation, holding coffee mornings and social events with external speakers and inviting colleagues from all over the organisation to learn more about how best to support LGBTQI+ colleagues. The Assured network is a strong community, supporting others and celebrating diversity as our strength."

I have been welcomed in to my role with open arms and will look to spend the next year developing new programmes which grow our links with other networks in HM Land Registry. I am also keen to work with other members to keep Assured as up to date as possible, and to make sure that everyone across the business knows there is a community here to support them."

The focus shone on welfare and wellbeing and developing a community where we all look out for each other is stronger here than in countless other agencies. This ethos is something we aim to build upon in Assured, creating an LGBTQI+ space which is open and safe for all."

As we look to the next 12 months, our eyes will be focused on making sure the sense of community felt across HM Land Registry continues to strengthen."
