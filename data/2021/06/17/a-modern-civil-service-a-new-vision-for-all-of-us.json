We are all signed up as Modernisation and Reform Champions and highly recommend you consider joining that network and make your voice be heard. The links can be found at the end of this blog. You will know that we have been closely involved with promoting and contributing to A Brilliant Civil Service over the last few years and we are excited with this inspiring new movement towards making a truly skilled, innovative and ambitious Civil Service, one fit for the modern age."
