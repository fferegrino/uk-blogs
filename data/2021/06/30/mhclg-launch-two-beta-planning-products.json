This is an exciting step towards 21st Century digital planning systems that use data and human-centred design to make applying for planning permission significantly simpler, faster and easier to understand."

The participating councils are inviting residents that need an LDC to use the new service, so that the teams can collect user feedback as they continue to improve the products to process other types of planning application. This is one of the important first steps towards digital planning reform."
