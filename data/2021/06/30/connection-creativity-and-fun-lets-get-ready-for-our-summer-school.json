Days will be shorter, lasting from 10am-2pm, to allow pupils to enjoy time outside of the classroom, and the year group will be split in two, each attending summer school for one week so the transition feels more manageable."

This can be challenging at any time, let alone after such a disruptive and unusual year. One thing that we were mindful of was that many of our new Year 7s would not have stepped foot in a secondary school before, so we hope that summer school will build their confidence and give them something to look forward to. The pandemic has been especially difficult for these children and I hope this opportunity gives us a chance to give them a bit of optimism and excitement for the future!"

We\u2019ve also spent a lot of time this year teaching digitally, so make sure you have some screen-free time by getting active, playing outside, curling up with a good book or getting creative in the kitchen. Do your thing and have fun! We look forward to meeting you all soon!"
