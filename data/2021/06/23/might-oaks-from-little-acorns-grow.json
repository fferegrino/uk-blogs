The small team had a big goal \u2013 to treble woodland creation in England, making the most of trees to sequester carbon along with many other benefits - all against the backdrop of a global pandemic."

We described this as building the plane as we flew it, all the time focussed on Government priorities of delivering natural capital benefits using Nature for Climate funds."

Our delivery partners struggled with fewer volunteers and tree planting teams than would normally help plant the trees. Coronavirus was taking its toll on our ability to plant the number of trees in our original plans."

            "text": "Then on the 18 May we launched the England Trees Action Plan. This was a key milestone, both as the culmination of all the team\u2019s hard work over the last year, and as an incredibly important framework, defining how we will continue to create and nurture trees and woods for future generations."

Sometimes exhausting, often inspiring, and we\u2019ve been so privileged to be working with a fantastic team across Defra, Forestry Commission and our other delivery partners. That word, \u2018partnership\u2019 embodies much of what has been most rewarding and will continue to be vital as we take next steps."
