            "text": "But sometimes being a role model is about giving those around you the confidence to deal with the negative.\u00a0 You may feel that because others view you as a \u2018positive\u2019 role model you are unable to speak up, rock the boat or challenge poor or inappropriate behaviours.\u00a0 But if you don\u2019t, you are showing you tolerate good results but bad behaviour, and what you tolerate becomes the norm."

            "text": "For example, in an experiment on how bystanders react to an incident, the number of other witnesses affected people\u2019s behaviour.\u00a0 When they thought they were the only witness, 85% of the participants reacted, but when there were five witnesses, only 31% intervened.\u00a0 Being a role model includes the ability to empower others to speak up or act when things are not right. This isn\u2019t saying you have to be a superhero, but when something is off, you want others to know they have the power to challenge and change it."

            "text": "You can also empower others to have the confidence to speak up when in need of support or help.\u00a0 Just because you are a role model does not mean you must always show a fa\u00e7ade of strength and resilience.\u00a0 Anything else is not weakness, it is human.\u00a0 Empowering others to seek support when they need to can make the difference between a niggle becoming a full-blown issue or being able to put reasonable adjustments in place to support all parties involved.\u00a0 Everyone can have a bad day, be stressed or experience mental health issues, but that doesn\u2019t stop you being a role model.\u00a0 Recent events and initiatives such as Stress Awareness Month and Mental Health Awareness week illustrate the importance of being honest and open about how we are feeling \u2013 whether good or bad, role model or otherwise."

            "text": "If others are able to see you as an authentic and genuine role model, they will recognise it is also OK to be honest with what they are dealing with.\u00a0 Being a positive role model means working with the good as well as dealing with the bad \u2013 it is OK not to be OK."
