I had secured an eight-week work placement on a project happening in my town. It was to construct a new road leading from the motorway into the town. I had not realised at the time exactly how much this would make a difference."

I had the opportunity to see how this road was going to positively impact our town, reduce congestion and make it easier for people to travel around. I wanted to be a part of being able to make that change. It was then that I realised engineering was the industry for me."

To be honest, I didn\u2019t relate the experiences I had were a form of \u2018engineering\u2019 until I was invited to a WISE course, which aimed to introduce girls studying physics and maths A levels to engineering. Without this insight, I would have probably studied chemistry at university as it was my strongest A level subject."

They are invaluable to the business."

It has helped me with presenting and having the confidence to speak in front of large groups. I think this is something I never considered when joining my apprenticeship but that I have enjoyed the most. It\u2019s given me a chance to push me out of my comfort zone and influence others."

Winning the award gave me a great sense of achievement and made me realise I can do this! But most of all I do deserve it!"

I felt very lucky to have a role model like her when entering my apprenticeship."
