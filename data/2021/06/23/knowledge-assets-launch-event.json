She shared her vision for the future: that there is great potential for the UK as the government starts to step up its approach to knowledge asset management.\u00a0She detailed the launch\u00a0of a new public sector tech-transfer unit as well as\u00a0a\u00a0new fund to support this work.\u00a0This unit will become a centre of excellence for knowledge asset management, bringing together\u00a0different public sector champions and supporting the work across the board."

            "text": "We also heard from Dr Penny Owen who described a range of the National Physical Laboratory\u2019s (NPL) cutting-edge technologies, the challenges in taking them forward and how a strategy can help address those barriers. These technologies include a graphene-based sensor that can detect COVID-19, an ion-trap based quantum processor that can produce atomic clocks and quantum computers, and a thermal imaging device which could revolutionise the identification and prevention of diabetic foot ulcers."
        },
        {
            "text": "Dr Owen said \u201cPublic sector organisations like NPL have a wealth of knowledge-based assets; untapped opportunities that could be applied to solving challenges like preventable amputations or enabling the UK to lead in quantum computing. We need to do more than manage these, we need to develop and exploit them fully.\u201d This directly aligns with the three principles to knowledge asset management in our draft guidance: identify, protect, exploit."

            "text": "Dr Mackintosh shared his motivation for the project; he had seen how powerful the broader innovation ecosystems around universities have become over the past 20 years, how companies deal with \u2018non-strategic\u2019 opportunities and how much capability and expertise there is within government departments. As the Mackintosh report details, there is estimated to be over \u00a3100bn in government knowledge assets, so even a modest increase in the return would generate huge benefits for the UK."
        },
        {
            "text": "Dr Mackintosh spoke of the vision for this initiative being government-wide, where potential can be found everywhere. He shared an example about The National Archives (TNA), which has world-leading expertise in digitizing archival material and has generated valuable revenues for its open-access activities by sharing that expertise with the United Arab Emirates. TNA provided high-level guidance and partnered with a UK SME to deliver the project; thereby also helping UK exports. Dr Mackintosh described this as an exciting shift in attitude: an organization is generating valuable knowledge assets as a by-product of being very good at what they do, and subsequently making broader use of this."

            "text": "This was a fantastic opportunity to look forward at what is to come as well as celebrating some of the brilliant knowledge asset successes that have already happened. An example discussed at the event was about how Transport for London\u00a0(TfL) has used both commercial and open\u00a0approaches to\u00a0generate a range of financial,\u00a0economic, and social benefits from their knowledge assets.\u00a0TfL release a significant amount of data,\u00a0including bus and tube timetables and disruptions into the public domain\u00a0for free.\u00a0This gave rise to a host of travel apps - such as Citymapper\u00a0- which\u00a0are used by 42% of Londoners\u00a0and\u00a0the basic version of them is\u00a0free to use.\u00a0Because of their popularity, it was estimated in 2017\u00a0that TfL is generating economic benefits of up to\u00a0\u00a3130 million by releasing their data in this format.\u00a0It has improved access to public service, reduced journey times for passengers,\u00a0grown London\u2019s economy and the apps provide\u00a0new\u00a0data to TfL.\u00a0A brilliant example of a public sector identifying something it held as having\u00a0intrinsic value\u00a0beyond their\u00a0organisation and\u00a0realising a range of benefits by exploiting it."
