Some students were able to take their webcams outside and others positioned them indoors, so we were able to observe their findings and I could also assist with their critical thinking. For us trainees, this style of teaching is part of our new \u2018norm\u2019 and current teachers have found inventive ways to adapt. It\u2019s an exciting journey to be on!"

Students could be given tasks to complete during the pre-recorded lesson, which they then handed in via the online classroom. For classes attending school in person but with a small number of children isolating, our online classroom has been a great tool in keeping these children up to date with work they have missed in class, allowing for a smoother transition back into the classroom. This is something that I am sure will continue post-pandemic."
