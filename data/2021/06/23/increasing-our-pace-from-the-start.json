The next step is the signing of the terms of collaboration agreement. This agreement provides us with the authority to access the authority\u2019s LLC data and demonstrates a commitment to migrate the service to the central LLC Register."

Its introduction has encouraged many to request earlier migration dates, which is good for pipeline planning. Seventy-five per cent of authorities who are at the early stage of migration have completed their service assessment. This assessment enables our team to calculate the size of an authority\u2019s service and quality of their data."

The shift to a digital approach has meant that while handshakes are off the table, the flexibility of remote meetings has allowed multiple meetings with local authorities each day.\u00a0This method of engagement has strengthened our working relationships and enabled even greater productivity. Over the last year we moved eight local authority services onto our LLC Register. Five of these were in the last two months."
