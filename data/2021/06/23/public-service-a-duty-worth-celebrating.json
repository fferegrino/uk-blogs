I was attracted to a job that offered very significant intellectual challenges and one that, while requiring considerable resilience and self-confidence, was part of an incredibly professional and supportive organisation. Just as fundamentally, the role is hugely worthwhile. Our decisions can never please everybody but the work that we do, examining development proposals and listening to diverse views about them, has significant impacts for the environment, the economy and, ultimately, peoples\u2019 lives."

Ultimately, I make recommendations on these issues for, and to, the Secretary of State."
