It costs HM Treasury \u00a394 million every year, vital funds which would otherwise go towards public services so it\u2019s important to catch tax evaders."

We\u2019re so pleased this was higher than the previous survey, but that still means that 1.6% of keepers across the UK are not taxing their vehicles."
