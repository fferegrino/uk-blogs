Our aim is to demystify what can often be seen as a complex area of law and help policymakers, MPs, and others across the political community understand the positive impact that intellectual property has on our social, cultural and economic lives."

They have sold over 22 million copies in 33 different countries and helped bring books to a whole new generation of young people. The books have generated their own series on Amazon Prime, supporting jobs across the TV and Film sectors, from script writers to carpenters."

Played all over the world, RuneScape has been played non-stop for 7,306 consecutive days, welcoming almost 300 million player accounts. It is now still as popular as ever due to its continuing innovation."

It lowers the cost of this type of filming for existing major film and TV production companies whilst also making it accessible for smaller film companies and even student film makers."

To do that they needed patents, design rights, trade marks and copyright to help them."

            "text": "The interesting thing about the creators and businesses we will hear from is how diverse they all are.\u00a0 What connects a book for young people with new virtual reality software or visual artists and painters with a computer game?\u00a0 How do they all fit with new medicines and vaccines that are helping us manage and escape the pandemic?\u00a0 Ultimately, they all rely on IP to protect their creativity and ideas."

In past strategies, IP has often been\u00a0 seen as a rarified topic that is unfathomable to the majority and not deserving of a more prominent place.\u00a0 We hope this time things will be different."

Its role stretches from enabling investment to providing incentives for businesses to work with universities to exploit their innovation promoting scale-up of medium-sized businesses, or finding opportunities for international co-operation."
