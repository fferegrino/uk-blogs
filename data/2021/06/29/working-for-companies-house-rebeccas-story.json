But don\u2019t just take our word for it. Here, our series of features in which employees reflect on what makes Companies House so special continues with Senior Recruitment Manager Rebecca Strange."

It was a bit of a miserable experience, to be honest, because I was the only person in the team working that way. The team was also changing around me with new people coming in who didn\u2019t know me. I felt forgotten."

We were sat in this park and I was saying \u2018I\u2019m stuck, this is my career, I hate it, I haven\u2019t got a partner so I can\u2019t retrain and do something else because it\u2019s all on me\u2019."
