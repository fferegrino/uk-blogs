This funding covers all costs associated with replacing unsafe cladding systems \u2013 including costs of access and replacement and missing or defective cavity barriers and insulation where it is part of the unsafe system. The costs of works to balconies may also be covered if they are integral within an unsafe cladding system. This is not reflected in the figures used in this report."
