We\u2019re dedicated to closing the gender skills gap within tech, so it was great to join up with Code First Girls whose mission is to encourage those who identify as women and non-binary into considering a future career within tech."

The session began with Chloe, a software developer at DWP Digital, explaining a bit about what JavaScript can be used for. I learned that it helps websites have actions and movement and is used in everything from smart watches to computer games. Internet browsers such as Chrome or Safari can decode JavaScript automatically."

These words were then \u2018decoded\u2019 or understood by the computer to make certain outcomes happen."

She explained some really useful parts of code like Boolean true/false types, if/else statements and loops. We were encouraged to code along as she demonstrated arrays (which let you store several pieces of data together) and how to add or remove items."
