For me, the motto of \u201cIf you can, you should\u201d is very important and I derive a deep sense of satisfaction from potentially saving lives and really making a difference. I actually find the experience enjoyable."

Then, a few weeks later, I receive a text to say where my blood has been sent to in the country. You\u2019d be surprised how far the blood travels to be used in the best way possible."

In addition, 40,000 more black donors are required to meet a growing demand for the rare blood types that are more common in people of black heritage. Not everybody can give blood, but from the 14 June, the questions asked before giving blood are changing. This means that more people will be eligible to donate blood based on their health, travel and sexual behaviour."
