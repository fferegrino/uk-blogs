In our team we\u2019re always thinking about the question \u2018why should they care\u2019. The work of the DDaT team aims to save users time, money or effort, and sometimes all the above. We try and stress this as it really helps motivate users."

Capturing more information means richer data in understanding how DIT supports businesses, which can be considered to inform government policies and further develop our services."

It\u2019s also a great way of keeping up momentum and interest in what you\u2019re building. Hosting show and tells or sharing updates with your stakeholders can be impactful in showing how your teams work contributes towards the bigger picture and our shared successes."
