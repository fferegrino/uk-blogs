We hoped that we could prompt a conversation about the importance of having engineers in the room at key points in the policy life-cycle. But the responses we received go beyond just practical issues and start outlining the professional identity of engineers in the policy context."

This reflects our respondents\u2019 focus on the attitude engineers can bring to policy-making. An engineering perspective can bring a solutions-focused and \u2018can do\u2019 attitude and ensure changes take place through a practical, realistic and pragmatic mindset."

            "text": "However, the survey suggests that engineers can bring more than just a set of attitudes to the policy table. They can bring a set of tangible tools as well. These include systems-based approaches and thinking, modelling, and life-cycle analysis. 'Softer\u2019 tools like drawing on a network of experts and multi-disciplinary working were also mentioned. Most of the tools listed bring a more holistic view, encompassing both social and technical elements, into the policy making process. The survey responses also frequently mentioned engineers apply approaches that are logical, reasoned, evidence-based, data-driven, structured, methodological and systematic."

Emphasis was placed on how engineers can help create new systems, solve problems and hence effect change in the world."
