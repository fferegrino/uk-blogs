But after this week\u2019s fiery episode, I\u2019m not sure I would be! This week we saw some fiercely passionate entrepreneurs fighting for their businesses despite some tough questioning from the Dragons. From recyclable shoes to a finalist in MasterChef: The Professionals, I was on the edge of my seat...but who managed to secure an investment? \u00a0"

Her business \u2018It\u2019s All About Shoes\u2019 took a whole new approach to designing shoes, focused on sustainability. Gaynor showcased her invention, a gliding mechanism which sits in the base of the shoe. This allows the strap to be moved up and down and removed, meaning the shoe is recyclable. \u00a0"

If \u2018It\u2019s All About Shoes\u2019 can solve that, then I\u2019m in.\u00a0"

A\u00a0patent\u00a0is a crucial way to protect your invention as it ensures no one else can copy, use or sell it without your permission. But some patents can be expensive and complex to get, so it\u2019s worth checking if getting one is right for your business.\u00a0\u00a0"
