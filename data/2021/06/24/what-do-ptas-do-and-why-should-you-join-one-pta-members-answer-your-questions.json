Our PTA Committee consists of the Chair, Secretary and Treasurer, these are a legal requirement of our charity status. To support these roles, we have a PTA Planning Team, which consists of a core team of five parents, two teachers (our teacher liaisons) and the Head Teacher. We also have a host of regular volunteers who support our fundraising events programme. We are a close team who work amazingly well together, raising between \u00a316-\u00a320k per year (in non-covid times!). Although this past school year we have still managed to raise \u00a312k so far, with \u00a315k projected, which is an amazing achievement! This has been through Mufti Days, Bag2School collections, Zoom Pumpkin Parties, Facebook Live Christmas and Summer Raffles, Christmas Card Project, Easter Trail, ECO HUB TerraCycle recycling, Preloved Uniform Sales, Dressing Up Costume Sales, Plant Sales and a Smarties Challenge. The pandemic made us think outside the box, but we still managed to keep the PTA wheels in motion! We\u2019ve also done a few free colouring/making competitions for when the children have needed a boost emotionally, as we are very much about giving back as well as fundraising. The children are always our main focus."

Even donating preloved items, raffle prizes or suggesting brilliant ideas are ways of getting involved. There seems to be a myth that if you get involved with your PTA you will never be able to escape! We make it clear that parents can come to our meetings to just listen and learn, or they can take a more active role if they want to, there are no set expectations."

You will probably be given a welcome pack by your school when you start which should also give you details about your PTA. If your PTA has a social media platform then join it, have a scroll and read all about what they have been up to. You might find your PTA has PTA Champions within each year group, seek them out and get to know them, they will be more than happy to help answer your questions. Finally, if none of the above exists speak to your school office and if your school doesn\u2019t have a PTA then consider rallying the troops and starting one yourself! You will find lots of resources on the Parentkind website for starting a PTA."

If you would like to take a more active role and find out more about PTA volunteering opportunities then attend a PTA meeting. This is a great first step. It is always a good idea to attend a few meetings to get to know the PTA and then when you are more confident you can start to take a more active role if you wish. You could always take a friend or two along and take on some tasks together."

            "text": "Check with your school office to see if the school has a PTA. If there isn\u2019t one then it is a good idea to gauge parents\u2019 interest in forming a PTA. Getting the schools backing is also important and speaking to other PTAs in your area is a great way to research how you might like your PTA to run. Once you feel confident that the PTA is happening then call a meeting (AGM \u2013 Annual General Meeting) to officially launch the PTA. Parentkind have lots of resources available to help you start your own PTA. You will need to consider what Constitution you need, this is the set of rules your PTA will abide by. Once this is all done then you are ready to introduce the PTA to your school community and start fundraising. Social media platforms are a great way to communicate with the school community and Parentkind have some great policies you can refer to keep all things safe and legal. Start small, with easy-to-run, manageable events and in time you will evolve and be able to grow with the full support of your school community."

            "text": "This is the million-dollar question for all PTAs, worldwide! The PTA runs on a continuous cycle, as children reach their final year and leave, so do the parents. PTAs are constantly needing new volunteers to ensure the PTA continues. From experience it is key you are clear about how people can contact you, get involved and keep a friendly tone to your social media and communications so people want to volunteer. We have found that volunteers are wary of taking on too much and often like to get involved in one or two events each year so we have recruited volunteers to events, rather than the entire PTA. For example, we have a Cake Sale team, Preloved Uniform team and a Christmas Card team with specific people who look after those events. We also have PTA Champions; these people are our go-to people in each year group for all PTA queries. It helps having someone in your year group who you can bump into on the playground to answer questions and dispel myths. We still need volunteers who want to take on more and this is where the PTA Chair, Secretary and Treasurer roles come in. People tend to build up to these roles as they are a bigger commitment with more experience required."

We realised we knew lots of families who lived near to school and developed a trail to get everyone out walking as a family."

Without the actual Christmas and Summer Fairs, which usually hosted the raffles, we had to make our raffles special. We decided to ask our parent community if anyone who had a business would like to donate a raffle prize. In return, we promoted each business with a social media post and showcased their business and raffle prize. We created a marketing campaign #ChristmasRaffleCountdown and #SummerRaffleCountdown. The school community loved it as they all learned about the wonderful businesses on our school doorstep and the prizes were just brilliant."

All of this activity helps enhance a school\u2019s reputation within the community. The PTA is often referred to as the heart of the school community and in our case it really is."
