Tonight\u2019s episode was jam packed with Rockstar spirits, nursing bras, immersive adventure-themed home work-outs, heat-free hair curling products and animated story books for children. So, without further ado \u2013 let\u2019s get down to business!"

It wasn\u2019t long before Deborah complimented Tom on his branding and illustrations, and what I thought was a beautifully decorated label. I\u2019ll be honest with you, if I ever fancy sampling something new and I haven\u2019t had time to do my research, I rely greatly on the appearance of a product. That will be the one that jumps off the shelf at me visually as I\u2019m rushing through the supermarket before getting back for the school run."

He walked in with an open mind with no mention of whether he had a preferred Dragon in mind. Possibly stirred into action by the rum, all Dragons aside from Sara Davies were quick to make Tom an offer. Theo Paphitis made a spirited attempt to gazump them all with his powerful offer of 50k for 10% equity.\u00a0 Fortunately for Tej & Touker they managed to claw their way back into Tom\u2019s sights. They partnered up with an 8% equity split between them for 25k of Tom\u2019s spiced rum business."
