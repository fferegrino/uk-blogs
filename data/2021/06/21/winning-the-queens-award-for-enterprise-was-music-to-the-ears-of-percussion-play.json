Musical instruments that could be shared outdoors with family, friends, and community, for people of all cultures, ages, and abilities and that are accessible, inclusive, and irresistible to play."

Recognising our products to be particularly niche and with a multicultural attraction, we resolved to offer them for sale globally and haven\u2019t looked back. We now have daily shipments being delivered to countries across Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe, North and South America."

We\u2019ve attended many international trade shows and conventions over the years to showcase our instruments and invariably have a steady stream of landscape architects, designers, educators, and suppliers specifically come to visit our booth to see and play our instruments. It seems there is a genuine hunger for quality British products made by a vibrant, creative company."

            "text": "Writing our awards application initially seemed a daunting process, especially when, like anyone running an SME, you have a million and one other things that need doing! However, once we recognised that the time spent on the application would be an investment in the business rather than a cost, we were able to dedicate the time needed. In fact, it was a rather satisfying process that allowed us to reflect on our achievements and motivated us to make new plans. Subsequently, we\u2019ve taken on several new team members to continue building towards the future."

The award has also been a big motivator internally and we\u2019ve witnessed a renewed sense of pride amongst the team. Seeing and hearing them sharing the details of our win with their own family and friends and social media was heart-warming. We\u2019re looking forward to meeting the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire in September and planning a proper celebration later this summer. Following a difficult year that has seen some of our team either temporarily furloughed or rapidly adjusting to working from home, this award has given us something to celebrate together along with our new team members who are excited to join an award-winning company."
