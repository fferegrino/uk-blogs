The results were impressive, with the no-mow areas alive with pollinators throughout the day."

The success of the initiative inspired further action and the team at Warcop have since entered into partnership with Cumbria Wildlife Trust (CWT) and Plantlife, who are acting on behalf of the CWT, to formalise the project which is named Meadow Maker."
