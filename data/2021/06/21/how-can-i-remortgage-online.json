This new level of automation is a big moment for HM Land Registry and will help caseworkers focus on more complex cases.

As we alluded to in our March blog on identity, this technology provides a high level of assurance in a neat user experience, making it simpler for borrowers to confirm their identity before signing their deed. In fact, our work has enabled us to really fast-track the work being undertaken on electronic signatures\u00a0and digital identity verification."
