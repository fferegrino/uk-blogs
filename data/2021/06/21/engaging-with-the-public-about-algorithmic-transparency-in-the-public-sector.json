But these opportunities will only be realised if data is used in accordance with the highest standards of ethics, privacy and security, in a way that engenders public trust."

In our review into bias in algorithmic decision-making, we recommended that the government should place a mandatory transparency obligation on all public sector organisations using algorithms when making significant decisions affecting individuals. This would require the proactive publication of information about the algorithms. By increasing transparency on how algorithms are used in decision-making in the public sector, we can promote responsible innovation in the use of AI, as well as help to facilitate public oversight and work to mitigate potential bias."

This involved spending time gradually building up participants' understanding and knowledge about algorithm use in the public sector and discussing their expectations for transparency, and co-designing solutions together.\u00a0"

Participants began to consider how they would encounter this information in their day-to-day life, and the volume of information that they expect to see (although with the continuing expectation that \u201call\u201d of the information would be available somewhere). Participants prioritised information about the role of the algorithm, why it is being used, and how to get further information or raise a query.\u00a0"

They expected more that experts, journalists and civil society may access this \u2018tier two\u2019 information on their behalf, raising any concerns which may be relevant to citizens.\u00a0"

For higher potential risk and higher potential impact use-cases there is a desire not just for information to be passively available and accessible if individuals are interested to know more about the algorithm, but also for the active communication of basic information upfront to notify people that the algorithm is being used and to what end. As part of this, it is felt that information should be more targeted and personalised.\u00a0"

Its findings will be consolidated with the outcomes of this public engagement project and will inform the development of a standard for algorithmic transparency. The prototype of this standard will then be tested and evaluated in an open and participatory manner."
