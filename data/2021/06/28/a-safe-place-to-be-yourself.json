Younger generations have grown up at a time where identity is understood differently and often more inclusively. It is also a place for staff members to reflect on these themes and for staff, who identify as LGBTQ+, to therapeutically share some details of their struggle. Non-LGBTQ+ residents go along to hear people\u2019s stories as allies."
