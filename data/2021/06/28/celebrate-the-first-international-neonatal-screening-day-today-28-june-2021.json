The NHS newborn screening programmes have provided life changing benefits for children who are identified and treated before the devastating effects of serious conditions such as phenylketonuria (PKU) can cause irreversible damage."

            "text": "During these 50 years, additional disorders which benefit from early detection and treatment have been added to the list of conditions screened for. Today, even more babies are identified in this way and go on to be treated successfully, reducing serious long-term health consequences and even premature death."

            "text": "The date of 28 June was chosen as it is the birthday of Dr Robert Guthrie \u2013 perhaps the most significant figure in the development of newborn screening as we know it today. He designed not just a test to identify PKU in asymptomatic babies, but also a means by which samples could be collected and transported safely and cheaply to laboratories for testing. This marked the dawn of the screening programmes that we still operate today."
