But of course, April 2020 was a year like no other and as such we postponed the launch until September. I am proud to announce the results in the 2020 Annual Report."

The two biggest shifts we have seen across government are an increase in the rollout of mobile devices and a move to online working. Both changes have resulted in a large reduction in travel, estates use and the associated carbon."

Therefore, for the first time, we have been working to ensure sustainable ICT will be included within the update of the Greening Government Commitments 2021-2025 (GGC), and the annual reports and accounting process (ARA), essentially departments wider sustainability and financial reporting. In addition, all ICT and digital projects and programmes, subject to the spend controls process, will be obligated to include sustainable ICT, as part of an updated Technology Code of Conduct measured in order to progress with the new Chief Digital and Data Office process."

This builds on our knowledge from private cloud and existing hosting data. The opportunities are huge for further improvements and efficiencies across the government hosting estate, but we must ensure our move to more efficient operations is coupled with the data and KPI\u2019s to support our sustainability objectives and wider government policy."

Through the STAR we will ensure that both Data and Digital help us understand and hopefully mitigate the climate crisis. This will be especially apparent in the 2020/21 annual report as it will capture the year that digital services replaced office working, commuting and business travel."
