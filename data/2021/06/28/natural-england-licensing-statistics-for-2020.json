More information on our licensing role can be found in my 2020 blog."

It\u2019s been a very busy time for licensing applications as we emerge from lockdown and local elections delayed our original publication plan. However, we are now very pleased to be able to publish our annual licensing statistics for 2020 and share these publicly."

In the summary table, you will find licences that have been modified or amended includes a prefix such as -1. All previous versions of that licence will therefore be superseded, and it does not result in a doubling of licensed numbers."
