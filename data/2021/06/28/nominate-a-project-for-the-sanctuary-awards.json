The project originally used virgin cardboard grades that were unique to the MOD risking a pricing premium for the materials, alongside lead-time issues for supply. The new modernised approach gives greater scope for the use of commercially available materials in corrugated Defence packaging, maximising the utilisation of recycled cardboard to help support MOD\u2019s Greening Government Commitments."

The project scored only 12 on the A-rated Energy Performance Certificate, making it a nearly zero emissions building. Using SMART technology, three new accommodation blocks at Nesscliff Training Area, also received a score of -5, meaning the building can generate power for the site, reducing electricity costs. This technology will continue to drive improvements to the design to ensure all future buildings are carbon neutral."
