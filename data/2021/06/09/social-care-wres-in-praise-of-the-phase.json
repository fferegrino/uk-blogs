Likewise, the many colleagues, mentors and stakeholders who have joined us on this essential journey have been the most positive of collaborators."

These models \u2013 or road maps \u2013 are graphic depictions of the shared relationships between resources, activities and outputs, and I am sure will help keep minds and actions focussed. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but this level of detail is testimony to the passion, drive, and commitment of LAs involved in this first phase."
