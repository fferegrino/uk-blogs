There is a growing ambition to build back fairer, faster, and greener - seizing the opportunity to rebuild towards a more sustainable future. Now, more than ever, it is important for countries to plan and spend scarce resources wisely. All too often however, projects are put forward without the vital early stage thinking and structured development needed for them to be implemented successfully and to attract international investment."

In this way the UK is helping these countries set up their infrastructure projects for success and opens the door for leading UK companies to support these vital rebuilding programmes."

            "text": "At the heart of this programme are two of the UK\u2019s renowned methodologies for project preparation: the 5 Case Model and the Project Development Routemap (known as Project Routemap in the UK). The 5 Case Model (5CM) is a business case development tool widely used across central, devolved and local governments in the UK and in other countries worldwide. It provides a framework for thinking and developing the case for any project . It looks at the project through five different lenses and charts its progress through 45 different steps in a structured way. Figure 1 shows the \u2018five cases\u2019."

            "text": "The Project Development Routemap (Routemap) is the UK government\u2019s support tool for novel and complex projects. It helps people responsible for delivering projects to understand the capabilities they need to set up for success. Routemap aligns with international best practice, such as the G20 Principles for the Project Preparation Phase, and incorporates learning from other major projects and programmes."

            "text": "Routemap helps projects consider their capabilities across people, processes, systems, governance, and ways of working. The tool looks at the entire project system, from sponsor through to the supply chain and asset managers and provides a collaborative way for stakeholders to work together, toward practical solutions, to address gaps in capability. Routemap is particularly useful when a project team lacks routine experience of delivering a particular project or they want to know the capabilities they need to succeed."

Given that gender and inclusion was a strong focus for the GIP, it was encouraging to see that 42% of people trained were women. Figure 3 shows the full geographic spread of the training courses."

            "text": "Despite this setback, the programme quickly adapted to delivering the courses online. If anything, virtual training had its benefits \u2013 for example in Indonesia, the virtual training meant that courses could be delivered more easily to regional as well as central government officials. The programme has demonstrated how mass capacity building can be effectively delivered through virtual ways of working."

The Indonesian government has made implementing the methodologies part of their Government Work Plan for 2021, which has been formalised by a presidential decree. Key aspects of the Five Case Model principles, such as the \u2018options framework\u2019, have been integrated into the revised PPP regulation in Indonesia. In Colombia, both the 5CM and PDR have also been endorsed by the office of the President."

IPA International is currently updating its international 5 Case Model guidance to more systematically address considerations of climate change throughout the business case development process. This updated guidance will be launched in the summer and will provide a practical tool to embed climate change principles in projects going forward."

Ahead of the UK\u2019s presidency of COP26, technical assistance to help countries meet their long-term climate change strategies will only grow in importance - with its updated methodologies IPA International stands well-prepared to deliver this."
