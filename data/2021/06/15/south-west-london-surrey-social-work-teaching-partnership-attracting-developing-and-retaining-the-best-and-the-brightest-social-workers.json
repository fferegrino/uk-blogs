The vast majority of students receive 2 statutory placements but we also offer students the chance to access valuable experience in the voluntary sector by spending a number of placement days with our Private, Voluntary and Independent partners, such as NSPCC and Welcare. Placements are also supported by our Partnership Practice Consultants and overseen by a group of representatives from across the partnership to ensure the quality and consistency of practice education."

These are practitioners who work for local employers and have responsibility for statutory social work. They teach on the qualifying programmes at Kingston University bringing theory to life with their experiences of frontline practice. In addition, they support the recruitment of prospective students onto the qualifying programmes and get involved in research projects relevant to their area of expertise. Most recently, in response to a lack of research on Black Men in Social Work, Kingston University was keen to create a space where people\u2019s stories could be heard and understood. They undertook the initial filming for this project on-site at Kingston University and the London Borough of Croydon, with 19 men being interviewed from Croydon. There are remarkable stories of resilience and determination, a commitment to social work values and of making history."

The EPD Framework allows practitioners who are 2-3 years post-qualifying to develop as a qualified social worker and build resilience, professional curiosity, leadership, mentoring and project skills."

Social workers (and students) also have access to the TP\u2019s comprehensive annual CPD offer. We provide in excess of 100 learning and development (L&D) opportunities per year, complementing local employers\u2019 internal L&D offers."
