This reflects the strength of user need \u2013 indeed, as the 2021 Census White Paper notes, \u201cThe user need [for ethnicity data] is higher than any other topic except age, sex and household relationships. The data are particularly important for local authorities, service planning, and meeting duties under the Equality Act 2010\u201d."

Ethnicity questions on surveys and administrative services are voluntary, and transparency considerations suggest that people should be made aware that they have the right not to provide the information."

            "text": "However, if it is made too easy for people not to provide their information, they might not do so. A lack of responses can limit the reliability of conclusions about the data."

            "text": "It can be argued that the need to maximise response rates means that when data is being collected, the \u201cdegree of optionality\u201d should be considered carefully when thinking about\u00a0 the principle that the resulting data should meet users\u2019 needs. \n\nFor example, providing people with detailed information about their ability to \u2018opt out\u2019 of a voluntary data collection, and including in the list of ethnic groups a category labelled \u2018prefer not to say\u2019, provides many opportunities for a respondent to choose not to provide their information. \n\nThere is a tension between this approach and mandating the collection of ethnicity data from respondents, and there are approaches informed by behavioural economics that are between these 2 ends of the spectrum. However, from the perspective of the analyst the user need for reliable data is the paramount consideration and should be the guiding factor."
