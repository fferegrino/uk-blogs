The debates about social care and the NHS were frequently focused on the issue of money. \u2018But,\u2019 says Alex, \u2019how much money is spent by whom, is only one of the questions facing all of us who work in health and care.\u2019"

That\u2019s not an expensive add-on, it\u2019s an integral part of achieving wellbeing within a model that costs on average \u00a326,000 per person less than care homes and other regulated care models."
