I have had a fantastic time in a challenging and interesting job at the centre of Government, working across the Civil Service and with the private sector, with my CVO colleagues in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and representing Defra and the UK nationally and internationally. But ten years is a good innings and it is time for me to move on. Do have a look at the advert, assess whether you meet the key criteria and seriously consider applying. It is a great job!"
