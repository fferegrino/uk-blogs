There was always someone we could call for a view, explanation or for help. This was vital; we had a lot to do to realise our new ministers' vision. I suppose I also knew a little about the subject; I'd just been temping in an alcohol support centre."

            "text": "As policy-makers, we must remember that a feeling of connectedness to a issue can be both a blessing and a curse. \u00a0It's a curse because we inevitably bring our own tacit assumptions and experiences to bear on what we think will and won't work. This shapes the decisions we make. \u00a0It's a blessing for much the same reason; we can bring a certain level of expertise and understanding to complex policy issues. Now, after five months working in Policy Lab I'd like to share some thoughts on early stage testing or 'prototyping'. \u00a0It think this is a handy way to mitigate the risk that we design for our tacit assumptions."

We were prototyping."

            "text": "Prototypes are ways to demonstrate how a service might look. \u00a0They allow us to test potential interventions at a really early stage. \u00a0As those who have worked with Policy Lab know, our design process starts by going deeply into how a citizen interacts with a service, making use of data science to look for patterns and then working in multidisciplinary teams to co-design potential interventions (see our slideshare for more). But whatever the process we take, the interventions we design will not yet be ready. We must first create small things that represent an aspect of the policy - something that can be shown to people to draw out what they think of it and whether they think it might work. "

            "text": "The concept of testing is not a new phenomenon in policy. \u00a0Whenever we are set a new brief by ministers we envisage what the service or intervention might look like and - often through policy submissions - ask people what they think. We consider a \u2018thought experiment\u2019. \u00a0We often consult with service users and practitioners. \u00a0We run ideas past our boss or colleagues. \u00a0We sketch diagrams. \u00a0We might even test out an idea with our friends whenever we say that we are 'just putting it out there'.

            "text": "First, prototyping is an acknowledgment that even after doing the research and building a great view of what the citizen wants, you are still a long way off a perfect policy.

        {
            "text": "Second, prototypes can be a more understandable and compelling way to explain how something might work. If you are thinking about creating a voucher scheme, make it tangible by mocking up a voucher and asking people if they would use it. \u00a0This might produce richer insights than sending someone a two page note on what you are trying to achieve."
        },
        {
            "text": "Third, and most critically, prototyping can be a tool to promote the thought diversity which I believe is so necessary in government. Like many conscientious policy makers, I've often been afraid of speaking an opinion for fear of being 'shut down' when someone finds an inevitable small flaw in an idea. Showing someone a prototype which demonstrates the idea can be a safe way of encouraging constructive criticism: saying \u201cthis won't be perfect, but here is what it might look like - are we going in the right direction?\u201d."
