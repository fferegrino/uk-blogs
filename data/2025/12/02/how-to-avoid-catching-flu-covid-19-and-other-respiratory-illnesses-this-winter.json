This can make you more vulnerable to severe complications from flu, such as pneumonia. If you catch flu during pregnancy, it can also cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birth weight and, if you get infection near to delivery, you can also pass it to your newborn baby. Babies under 6 months of age have one of the highest hospitalisation rates for flu every season. Vaccinating against flu during your pregnancy means that you will make an immune response (including antibodies) to the vaccine, and these protective antibodies are passed onto your baby through the placenta,\u00a0 helping to protect your baby for the first few months of their life.\u00a0You can have the flu vaccine at any stage of pregnancy, from conception onwards.\u00a0"
