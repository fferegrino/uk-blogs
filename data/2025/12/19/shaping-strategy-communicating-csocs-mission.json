It's about helping people see the bigger picture \u2013 understanding how their individual work connects to our broader mission, and how CSOC fits into the wider Defence landscape. This perspective has informed my work on outreach activities like our Citizens Panel, which gathered valuable insights to shape the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) launch, and my efforts to strengthen relationships with think tanks."
