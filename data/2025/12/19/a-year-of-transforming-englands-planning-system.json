And with almost 200 councils now part of ODP, growing momentum in data standardisation, and AI tools like Extract set to launch widely next year,\u00a0we're\u00a0on track to deliver the efficient,\u00a0transparent\u00a0and accessible planning system that England needs to meet its ambitious housing targets.\u00a0"
