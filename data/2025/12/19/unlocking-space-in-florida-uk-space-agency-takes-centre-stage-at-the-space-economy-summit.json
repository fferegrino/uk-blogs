The conversation covered shared challenges including the difficulty of securing capital at the right moment, the complexity of navigating assurance, standards and procurement, and the persistent challenge of building international routes to market."

            "text": "There was a shared view that investor understanding remains a critical gap, which could be addressed with better education, better evidence and clearer demand signals. There was also an emphasis on the importance of focusing on real markets rather than speculative ones: identifying a customer, articulating the value add, and demonstrating how satellite tools complement existing solutions. Several participants highlighted that governments have far more influence than they often acknowledge, not only as procurement bodies, but as enablers of launch access, tax environments and regulatory clarity across non-space bodies."

Dr Craig Brown, the UK Space Agency\u2019s Investment Director, joined global leaders to explore how AI is transforming space-derived information into real world insight, drawing upon live case studies from the Unlocking Space portfolio. The discussion underscored a theme central to the UK\u2019s approach \u2013 that transparency, standards and data quality are as important as the algorithms themselves, if AI-enabled space services are to earn public trust and scale internationally."
