Thought leaders and innovators from environmental NGOs, academia, finance, infrastructure and local government joined Natural England at our Science, Evidence & Analysis for Nature Recovery conference to discuss our science and consider how we might work together to drive nature recovery into the future."

            "text": "At the conference we launched Natural England's Science, Evidence & Analysis Framework 2025-2030, our roadmap for embedding robust science and evidence into decision-making, to ensure our strategy is powered by science. Speakers and panellists challenged and inspired us with thought-provoking insights, highlighting opportunities to drive innovation for nature recovery."

He reminded us that small, incremental changes would be insufficient to deliver the scale of transformation needed for genuine nature recovery. Bold action, matching the urgency of the challenge, is essential."

            "text": "John made clear that recovery is not something any organisation can achieve alone. Strong partnerships across government, environmental NGOs, business, academia, and local communities will be vital if we are to recover nature and secure its place at the heart of our future."

This award-winning project in Norfolk exemplifies how technological innovations are transforming our ability to gather rigorous science and evidence to better understand nature."

She demonstrated how Biodiversity Net Gain can be embedded at any scale, with Steve Panks, Natural England showing how it is already shaping policy and planning. Our ornithologists presented approaches to developing evidence on seabird flight paths, now guiding turbine placement to protect marine habitats while meeting energy needs. Together, these examples highlighted how Natural England is ensuring that development and recovery go hand in hand."

This reflects Natural England\u2019s wider mission to embed nature into everyday decision\u2011making and ensure nature recovery is seen as a driver of growth, not a cost."

He highlighted wetlands, natural flood defences, and healthy ecosystems as practical, cost\u2011effective ways to protect communities and build resilience. "

            "text": "Building on this, Natural England teams demonstrated how a stronger evidence base is essential to anticipating risks and guiding decisions. From frameworks that support resilience to research on the people and nature connection, they showed how evidence can reduce health inequalities, improve wellbeing, and strengthen communities."

            "text": "Professor Michael Winter OBE reinforced that this evidence must reflect both ecological and social realities. He stressed it\u2019s not enough to rely solely on ecological data, integrating social science is vital to capture community values, cultural influences, and economic drivers. This ensures that solutions deliver benefits for both nature and society, and was well reflected by Dr Ruth Water\u2019s description of the State of Natural Capital work and Natural England\u2019s commitment to evidence that is rigorous, relevant, and rooted in the way people live and interact with the natural world."

Embedding these values into financial and policy frameworks reframes recovery as a pathway to long\u2011term growth, health, and security."
