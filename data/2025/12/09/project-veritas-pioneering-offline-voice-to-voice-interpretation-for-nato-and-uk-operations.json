Led by jHubMed - the Ministry of Defence\u2019s innovation unit for medical capability, operating under Cyber & Specialist Operations Command (CSOC) and supporting Defence Medical Services (DMS) priorities. Delivered in collaboration with MyLanguage, a NATO DIANA innovator and commercial partner, and supported by the 2nd Battalion The Ranger Regiment (Army Special Operations Brigade)."

Project VERITAS empowers every soldier to communicate effectively without relying on a physical linguist.For example, a medic treating an injured local can now explain procedures directly in their language, even in remote areas. This capability is equally vital for humanitarian missions, disaster relief, and civilian interactions, ensuring that language never becomes a barrier to safety or trust."
