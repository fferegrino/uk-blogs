Since then we have helped more than 570 public sector organisations process over 120 million individual transactions through more than 1,500 services. Recently, we\u2019ve also\u00a0surpassed the \u00a38 billion milestone in payments processed for public sector services. These are all big, and impressive numbers, but there\u2019s a lot more granular data informing decision-making behind the scenes.\u00a0"

We take millions of payments for some services each year, while also catering for services that only need to take a handful of transactions.\u00a0"

Our decisions should then reflect these objectives.Aside from these, we also have a number of additional objectives and key results (OKRs) that are used. These make sure we are able to prove that any additional changes we make to the product have data points against them so we can show the impact. For example, we can see that recent changes we made to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool have made it quicker for service users to get things done: with people spending 2 minutes less on average in our 'Settings' section."
