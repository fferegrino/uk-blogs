Marie was part of the team that delivered in-person workshops along the East coast in Norwich, King\u2019s Lynn and Hull during September. Local stakeholders had the opportunity to hear about the progress on the plan so far and provide feedback on draft policies and key themes. Stakeholders shared their knowledge and understanding of the east marine plan areas and provided their valuable unique insights. Understanding stakeholder views is essential to creating a well-informed and balanced plan. This feedback was then integrated into the next phase of policy drafting. You can read the summary report for all of the recent East engagement here."

The programme hosted a visit from a Philippine delegation, primarily Government representatives, to share knowledge and best practices on marine spatial planning and governance. The visit convened key government counterparts together with UK experts to widen their knowledge base on marine planning in terms of regulation, co-implementation and monitoring. We learnt that the Philippine planning and process for offshore wind development has many parallels to the UK."

Local rangers shared updates on seal disturbance and biosecurity measures, as well as biodiversity census results for seabirds and seals. Meetings like these provide important opportunities to understand regional issues, explore ongoing coastal initiatives, and strengthen networks with key stakeholders."

During Ellie\u2019s visit, she accompanied marine officers to the harbour master\u2019s office and observed a Band 1 licence inspection. This experience highlighted the reactive nature of the work of the operations team in the MMO and the challenges they face on the ground. It also brought to life the applications of marine plans and policies."
