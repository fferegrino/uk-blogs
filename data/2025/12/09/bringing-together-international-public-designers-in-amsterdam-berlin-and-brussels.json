This year, we've hosted our biggest event since 2019, bringing together hundreds of public sector designers from across the globe. With exciting plans for further events in 2026, here's an update on what's happened recently and what's coming up next."

In a time of shifting priorities and roles for user-centred digital teams in government, it felt important to acknowledge how to design longevity into our practices so that they endure. The rest of the day was spent on excursions around Amsterdam and Rotterdam. In small groups we went on visits to: City of Amsterdam, Netherlands Police, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, City of Rotterdam and Novum, the Innovation Lab of the SVB (Social Insurance Bank)."

Presenters from Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK shared their work on prison, legal data and housing services.A recording and a writeup of the webinar is available online.

We looked at different approaches on design for policy. From the EU\u2019s Policy Lab, we heard about the dynamic effects of design on policymaking culture in the union. German colleagues shared their approach to digital-ready legislation, and the Head of Policy & Service Design from Camden Council, Alejandra Diaz, shared what designing policy with communities looks like."

We wanted to hear and share what community members do today and where barriers are to getting involved in other stages of the policy cycle. We shared approaches, failures and hopes. Collectively, we recognised that some of us are involved in short-term lawmaking, others in long-term policy theme exploration. Contexts and setups differ vastly."
