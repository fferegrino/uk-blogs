The RPC has been experimenting with using AI tools over the past few months to see how far these can help us with different aspects of our work. "

        {
            "text": "AI has been very helpful in producing meeting notes and minutes. AI-generated transcripts from meetings are sufficiently accurate that staff can participate fully in the meeting rather than having to divide their attention between discussion and note-taking. The error rate is low enough that light editing suffices to produce a set of minutes and notes of the meeting."
        },
        {
            "text": "AI is also very useful in searching and summarising documents. When we are drafting our opinions, we often need to check what the Committee has said previously on similar or related issues. AI tools can search through hundreds of past RPC opinions in our archive and pull out relevant passages far faster and more comprehensively than a manual review."
        },
        {
            "text": "We have also seen time savings in producing our opinions. AI can produce acceptable first drafts of routine documents and maintain our house style. It cannot, however, identify the critical analytical weaknesses in an impact assessment or produce the kind of tightly reasoned argument that belongs in an expert opinion from the RPC. What it does well is speed up the mechanical parts of writing."

        },
        {
            "text": "The main challenge is calibration. We've built a master prompt that can generate RPC-style drafts of our opinions, but producing an appropriate judgement of the quality of an impact assessment is difficult. Set it too critically and it produces unhelpful objections to everything. Set it too leniently and it misses genuine analytical gaps. The useful range is narrow, and what counts as 'appropriately critical' varies depending on the quality of the underlying analysis."
        },
        {
            "text": "The other limitation is that AI cannot engage with the substantive policy questions that often matter most. It can check whether an impact assessment has followed HM Treasury\u2019s Green Book methodology, but it cannot assess whether the assumptions underlying a cost-benefit analysis are defensible given the actual policy context. That still requires human judgement informed by our expert experience."

        },
        {
            "text": "We are looking at using our archive of the RPC\u2019s past opinions as training data to improve AI drafting. The idea is that the system might learn to recognise the standards the Committee applies in practice, rather than just following written guidance. Whether this improves analytical rigour, or just teaches the system to reproduce house style more convincingly, is an open question but is worth testing."
        },
        {
            "text": "A more ambitious idea is whether we could build an interface that lets analysts across government submit impact assessments for AI-generated feedback before formal submission to the RPC. The logic would be to catch basic analytical errors early, when they are easier to fix, rather than only identifying them during formal scrutiny."

            "text": "The underlying reality is that AI can help with mechanical tasks and pattern recognition, but human scrutiny and expert judgement are still needed to understand the policy context (at least for now!)."
