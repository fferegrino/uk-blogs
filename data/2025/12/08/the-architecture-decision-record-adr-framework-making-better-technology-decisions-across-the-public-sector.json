This handy structure is designed to help teams to consistently make and record technology decisions in order to reach the UK government\u2019s goals of better-documented decisions, less duplication and more joined-up delivery."

            "text": "Documenting decisions is essential across all levels of government departments, particularly for those that need to be brought to the Technical Design Council (TDC). The TDC is made up of empowered Chief Technology Officers from across the public sector as a commitment set out in the blueprint for modern digital government. The TDC is responsible for decisions which affect cross-government architecture and shared platforms, in which ADRs play a major part."

            "text": "In the public sector, we make thousands of technology decisions every year. This number will only increase as we work on delivering the ambitious vision set out in the blueprint for modern digital government, which requires us to make better and more consistent decisions. Some are small. Some are huge. But when they\u2019re undocumented, we risk repeating work. When people move on, we can lose context of why decisions were made in certain ways. Most importantly, we miss opportunities to reuse good thinking."

            "text": "But we also learned that ADRs only work if they\u2019re part of the team\u2019s normal rhythm rather than bolt-ons or box-ticking exercises, so further change may be required to establish the practice of ADRs as standard."

While it won\u2019t be mandated for day-to-day team decisions, it will be needed for anything brought to the TDC. We\u2019re inviting more teams to test the framework and tell us what works so that we can adapt and improve it based on your feedback. We\u2019re also looking at how ADRs can support wider reforms, such as reducing legacy risk, improving technical resilience and enabling joined-up services."
