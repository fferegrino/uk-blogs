            "text": "The Shared Infrastructure team in Justice Digital launched an innovative new product (The Small Services Space) just over 12 months ago. It aims to support smaller teams who have a need, and desire, to modernise or mature using digital solutions but don't always have the skills and experience to achieve their vision. The team set out to provide as much end-to-end support as needed from scoping solutions through to deploying a production service as part of the Small Services Space product."

            "text": "The benefits of modernisation are well documented in terms of saving money, reducing man-hours, and improving user experience, but there are much broader benefits in terms of reputation, governance, and assurance. These are benefits the Shared Infrastructure team was committed to helping teams realise."

            "text": "The past 12 months have been a huge learning curve, and it\u2019s a good point to reflect on the value and impact the service has had. Here are some of the things the Small Services Space has enabled teams to achieve by supporting them to solve their problems digitally."

It will be everywhere by Christmas. This iterative implementation has allowed collaboration with our supplier ensuring a robust, user-friendly system tailored to operational needs, supported by high quality training & support."

Moving away from paper-based dog record books has also reduced costs, but the real benefit comes from the time saved. By transforming our ways of working and adopting a digital approach, we have avoided substantial expenditure of staff time."

They also plan to onboard private sector dog records so that staff who need them can access them easily. A comprehensive quality assurance audit will be conducted to ensure data accuracy and appropriate access levels. They are also working directly with the supplier on software changes to further enhance the system's user-friendliness."
