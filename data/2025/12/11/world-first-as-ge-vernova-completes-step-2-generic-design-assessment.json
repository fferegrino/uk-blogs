This is subject to the completion of the further work identified in our regulatory observation (that we have concerns about waste segregation that will need to be resolved) and completing a detailed assessment of the design. Currently the company proposes not to change the design to enable sorting and segregation of waste ion exchange resins and liquid waste arisings. If it can\u2019t demonstrate that its proposals on waste segregation are BAT, then design changes may be required."

The source term is essentially the level of radioactivity that is expected to arise in the reactor\u2019s cooling circuit. We consider that it is overly conservative and so discharges are overestimated."
