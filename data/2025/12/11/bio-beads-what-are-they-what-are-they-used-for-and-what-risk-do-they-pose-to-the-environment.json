Over time some of these chemicals may eventually be released as the plastic degrades. If recycled plastic is used it may also contain other contaminants, such as metallic elements, from the original plastic. Whether these chemicals have a harmful impact in the environment will depend on the nature of the chemical, the concentration of that chemical and how long anything is exposed to it. Chemical levels released from such plastics are usually extremely low, but the risks increase where the chemicals are persistent, not readily diluted and exposure to wildlife is prolonged.\u00a0"

Sadly, any release of bio-beads to the water environment adds to the already huge burden of plastic pollution in the water environment today. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has estimated that every year, worldwide, 19-23 million tonnes of plastic waste leak into aquatic ecosystems, polluting lakes, rivers and seas.\u202f\u00a0"

Bio-beads are not used in all sewage treatment works but may be useful where there are physical constrictions on a site. Their use is decreasing however as water companies invest in new technologies to treat sewage. There are alternative materials for beads which have been used, such as glass or clay and some treatment plants use other processes to treat their effluent, such as fixed filters.\u00a0"
