She\u2019s a curious little thing and rummaged through everything in her path, grabbed a toy and raced around the coffee table with pure delight (nearly sending our coffees flying in the process). \u00a0"

            "text": "Her love of food, however, came with a challenge. She used to eat her food so quickly that one day she struggled to swallow it, and we had a terrifying moment where she seemed to be choking. She toppled onto her side, her legs moving as if she were running, but thankfully that motion dislodged the food and she was fine, but it gave us quite a scare! We soon looked into how to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on a dog, which is really handy to know!\u00a0"

            "text": "Since then, we\u2019ve invested in a slow feeder bowl, which has been a lifesaver, literally. This registered design (GB6263701) protects the visual appearance of a slow feeder dog bowl, featuring raised obstacles and compartments that help prevent pets from gulping their food too quickly. The distinctive structure combines safety with practicality, making mealtimes much safer for dogs prone to bloat."

            "text": "She can sometimes feel a little anxious around other dogs, so we use a retractable lead to walk her with. This allows her the freedom to explore on her walks, while still giving us full control if another dog comes too close.\u00a0 Interestingly, a patent for this type of retractable pet lead was filed by Philip Martin Nicholson in 1977 (GB1546235A\u00a0)"

            "text": "Because she can be a little anxious, we often bring along a snuffle mat to keep her happily occupied at bars and restaurants. For car journeys, we also use a specially designed travel water bowl (Patent GB2428551B) invented by Natalie Ellis. The bowl's floating inner section and liquid feed holes prevent spills when we're on the move, keeping both Rosa hydrated and our car seats dry!"

Sadly, there are people who try to cut corners with cheap, unsafe products just to make a profit and this puts our pets at great risk which is not ok. This campaign explains all about that. So next time you\u2019re shopping for products for your pet, take a moment to make sure it\u2019s the real deal and not a fake alternative \u2013 it could save your pets life!\u00a0"

When you adopt, you\u2019re not just giving a dog a second chance, you\u2019re also getting a best friend for life which is exactly why adoption is one of the best things you can do if you ever get the chance.\u00a0\u00a0"
