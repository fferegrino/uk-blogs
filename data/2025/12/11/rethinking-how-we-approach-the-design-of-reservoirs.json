But these projects aren\u2019t just about storing water \u2013 they\u2019re also a chance to create beautiful, nature-rich places that benefit both people and wildlife."

            "text": "When we talk about a landscape-led approach, we mean designing with the land, not just on it. It\u2019s about understanding the unique character of a place \u2013 its natural features, history, and how people connect with it \u2013 and using that understanding to shape how new developments, like reservoirs, are planned and built."

        {
            "text": "When we think of reservoirs, we often picture vast bodies of water quietly storing the supply we rely on for drinking, farming, and industry. But behind every reservoir lies a deeper story \u2014 one of transformation, trade-offs, and potential."

        {
            "text": "No matter how big or small, every reservoir reshapes the landscape around it. The ecosystems that once thrived in these spaces are disrupted, and the natural balance shifts. It\u2019s a reality that can\u2019t be ignored."

            "text": "While these changes are inevitable, in the longer term they don\u2019t have to be destructive. With thoughtful, landscape-led design, reservoirs can do more than just store water \u2014 they can become hubs of ecological resilience. Imagine a reservoir that not only meets our water needs but also supports wildlife, restores degraded land, and creates new green spaces for communities to enjoy."

That\u2019s why the new Reservoir Design Principles take a landscape-led approach, focusing on how water infrastructure can work in harmony with nature."

            "text": "Reservoirs are large and often transformative developments. Done well, they can become valued parts of the landscape \u2013 places where people walk, sail, fish, or simply enjoy nature. Many existing reservoirs have already become beloved local landmarks."
