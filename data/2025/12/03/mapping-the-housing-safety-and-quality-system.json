When we say \u2018people in the system\u2019, that includes everyone from regulators, to people working in construction, those providing insurance and finance, and of course residents.\u00a0"

Those organisations enforce and work to over 70 pieces of legislation. The people who design, build and maintain every home need to navigate that complexity. Depending on their role, professionals might also work to professional standards as well. We heard that complexity and ambiguity in regulations has left some people unsure of their roles, responsibilities and expectations of others, even where they understand and agree with a policy's underlying aims."

There are many systemic root causes for these issues, which we are looking to explore further. In particular, local and national regulators reported capacity and capability struggles which can impact regulation\u00a0 enforcement activity, proactive work and the ability to build trust between teams."

Vulnerable residents can be worried about and experience more barriers when accessing support. Concern about and perception of risk also impact how people \u2013 from regulators to residents \u2013 make decisions across the system.\u00a0"
