We\u2019ve also legislated for new restrictions on unhealthy food and drink to tackle obesity. As the mother of 16-year-old twins, that\u2019s particularly close to my heart.

As an example of how we\u2019re supporting this, we are already seeing the NHS app in action. 39.5 million people now use it - that\u2019s three in four adults. One in four patients registered with a GP have logged into the app, and primary care appointments booked through it are up 8% on the year before. People are ordering repeat prescriptions digitally, up by 33% in the last year, accessing care at a time that\u2019s convenient to them. That reduces workload at GP surgeries and gives people control over their healthcare.\u00a0"
