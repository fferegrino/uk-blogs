            "text": "When I joined Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust twelve years ago as a small trust of just four schools, managing our banking seemed straightforward. Today, as Chief Financial Officer of a 35-school organisation spanning 30 Catholic primary schools and five secondary schools across Darlington, County Durham, Stockton and Hartlepool, I've learned that smart banking arrangements can be transformational for educational outcomes."

            "text": "Our significant expansion came between March 2020 and May 2022, when we grew from 15 to 35 schools as part of our diocese's strategic restructuring. This rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic taught us valuable lessons about managing banking resources at scale."

Our school business managers can focus with Headteachers on their school\u2019s educational priorities rather than banking administration."

            "text": "The efficiency gains are clear: As we've got more mature and got bigger, my team is able to answer more of the questions directly themselves and need to ask fewer questions of the business managers. This frees up valuable time in schools for educational leadership and pupil support."
