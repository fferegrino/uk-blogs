Event Duration Monitor (EDM) data is a vital regulatory tool. As of the end of 2023, 100% of storm overflows were fitted with an EDM, and since the 1st of January 2025, water companies have been required to publish this data in near real time. This gives us full oversight of the whole overflow network, closing a major transparency gap in the water industry. We use EDM data to plan what investigation and improvement work from water companies needs to take place, and to work with water companies and local partners to act where needed."
