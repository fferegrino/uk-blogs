The perception noted here is that patterns can stifle creativity, rather than enable it. This is interesting in comparison with the insight about \u2018unofficial patterns\u2019 and designers working together organically to leverage others\u2019 foundational work."

            "text": "The use of patterns was most mature in UX and IT systems in all our organisations and were used to greater or lesser degrees in services and policy. This seemed to echo previous experiences with agile project methodology. Agile began in IT and has spread into other disciplines, with modifications. Principles and concepts of an agile approach are transferable to some extent, but not all of the rituals and deliverables of agile project methodology are relevant in different discipline contexts."

While efficiencies are one of the benefits sought through pattern use, there was sometimes an unrealistic expectation that pattern libraries would maintain themselves, and that patterns could be used effectively by those with no design capability."
