The answer will bring together content from across government: in this example joining up the support offer from HMRC, DWP and the Department for Education, into a single, simple conversational answer."

It\u2019s a core part of the work GDS is doing to create a new generation of personalised, joined-up public services. It was highlighted as one of 5 \u2018kickstarters\u2019 in the blueprint for modern digital government, and in July it was selected as one of the Prime Minister\u2019s AI Exemplars."

We\u2019ll start with a release in the GOV.UK app early next year. Beyond that, we intend to make it widely available across the GOV.UK website so it\u2019s accessible wherever users need it."

It will provide citizens with an additional choice of how they can access the content and services they need, in a simple natural language interface. As with all our products, we\u2019re taking a user-centred, agile approach \u2013 rolling out in stages and making improvements as we go. We\u2019ll continue to invest heavily in measures designed to minimise risks and protect users\u2019 privacy and security. We\u2019re excited for more people to try GOV.UK Chat and give feedback to our teams."

We\u2019re experimenting with agentic AI, and the idea that GOV.UK Chat can evolve from providing answers to performing actions, helping users get things done with government more easily. We\u2019re currently running product explorations into this next set of features."

This underlines that GOV.UK Chat can only be as good as the content published on GOV.UK by departmental teams. Clear and accurate content will result in better answers, so prioritising good content design is even more important than ever."

So, for departments, if you\u2019re in the process of building a public-facing chat experience, please reach out to our team early so we can ensure we\u2019re creating a joined-up experience for citizens and avoid duplicated costs. We can envisage use cases where it makes sense to pass GOV.UK Chat users on to a department\u2019s AI agent or service when needed, and we\u2019re carrying out experimental work to build the technology to do this. We want to collaborate with teams to establish common standards for how this works in government, keeping the experience seamless for users."
