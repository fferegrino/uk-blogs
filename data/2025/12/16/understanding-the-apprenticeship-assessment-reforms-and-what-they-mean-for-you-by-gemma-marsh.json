What I\u2019ve heard consistently is that every sector is different, and that change needs to be delivered in a pragmatic, proportionate way, rather than through a one-size-fits-all approach."

A Department for Education review in 2024 reflected what many of you told us \u2014 that although apprenticeships deliver strong outcomes, the assessment process can be overly complex, burdensome and time-consuming."

By selecting an appropriate and representative subset of all the possible knowledge and skills statements required, assessments will continue to demonstrate a valid and reliable outcome of occupational competence. This approach also reduces the assessment burden for providers, assessment organisations, employers and apprentices."
