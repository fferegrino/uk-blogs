Unlike other cyberattacks that directly target networks and systems, phishing uses social engineering techniques to expose human error. It uses fake stories and pressure tactics to manipulate victims into unintentionally harming themselves or their organisations. Phishing poses a major risk because it targets people rather than technology. Attackers don\u2019t need to hack systems or bypass security tools, they simply manipulate individuals with legitimate access. By doing so, they can obtain money, sensitive data, or other valuable assets without breaking in themselves."

We also had 11 external programmes, carried out by Integrated Corporate Services (ICS). ICS offers a centralised and\u00a0innovative way of delivering core functions within the Civil Service \u2013 facilitating Cyber Training in collaboration with the Metropolitan Police. Over 1000 attendees is a massive achievement considering the usual challenges around getting colleagues to prioritise this learning over everything else. Yet even with these hurdles, we saw the message take root.  That was a defining moment as it showed the impact of our awareness campaign."

It\u2019s human psychology, as we\u2019re wired to react to threat and curiosity. Our \u201cDark Web and Stolen Credentials\u201d session was a standout success because it hit both, which made people connect their actions and behaviours with the huge risks involved."

For example, although phishing emails are getting more sophisticated and harder to detect due to generative AI, the usual red flags are still there:"
