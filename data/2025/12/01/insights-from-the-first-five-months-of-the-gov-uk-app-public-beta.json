It was a big moment - for the first time, we\u2019ve enabled people to have a more customised and persistent GOV.UK experience. The release was the culmination of months of user research, product design and technical expertise, so it was very exciting to see it out in the wild."

Because people are logged in, the GOV.UK app remembers the pages they have visited and what they\u2019ve searched for previously, getting them quickly to the content they care most about. Users can also access their local council services quickly by entering their postcode, and can opt in to receive push notifications to stay informed of real-time updates and alerts."

We\u2019ve been learning about how these users are engaging with the GOV.UK app, gathering insight on how this first version is working, and what we can do to make it even better. We\u2019ve\u202fbeen using Google Analytics to see how consenting users are interacting with the app, alongside an in-app survey.\u202f\u202f"

One respondent to the in-app survey said: \u201cEasy to navigate through app. Very user friendly designed\u201d. Whilst accessing web content in the app is working well in many places, we\u2019ve also seen that there are some areas where this is limiting the experience for users: \u201cI don\u2019t like how the app mostly just links to web pages at the moment\u201d, so we\u2019ll be exploring how we get this balance right."

Travel content prompts sparked interest and usage indicating they were timely and relevant. While external nudges, like articles on government topics such as pension articles and Companies House\u202fregistrations, show that users are actively searching for the app as an alternative channel. Seasonal trends play a part too, with noticeable upticks around student services at the end of September."
