            "text": "I\u2019m Adam Mazrani and I work in the External Affairs team in the Home Office Communications Directorate. Over the past year, I\u2019ve led stakeholder engagement on the government\u2019s mission to halve knife crime within 10 years."

            "text": "Last July, ahead of introducing Ronan\u2019s Law, we ran the government\u2019s largest knife surrender scheme, funding 37 new surrender bins across London, the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. The scale was ambitious. The challenge? Even bigger."
        },
        {
            "text": "The truth is that the government will always struggle to reach communities and individuals most likely to carry or come into contact with knives. Our stakeholder network, particularly the Coalition to Tackle Knife Crime comprising charities, victim support organisations, youth hubs, and tragically, the families and friends of knife crime victims, would need to bridge that gap."
        },
        {
            "text": "So we did something simple but powerful: we listened from day one. Before launch, I brought stakeholders together to stress-test our messages and creative assets. What would land in their communities? What might fall short?\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "Then we kept the conversation going. Each Monday without fail, I ensured the network received email updates on progress, and key successes with photos of surrendered knives. These weren\u2019t courtesy emails. Stakeholders used that content in their own social posts, amplifying the message in ways we never could.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "And when they told us what else they needed, we delivered. More bespoke social media assets. Physical posters for boxing gyms and supermarkets. Communication tailored to real places and real conversations.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "I felt proud of how we drew on the stakeholders\u2019 knowledge and passion through every stage. My biggest challenge was how we\u2019d keep stakeholders engaged, as the month progressed and attention on the scheme ebbed and flowed with ever-changing priorities. How could we avoid upsetting them? How could we keep them updated, demonstrating that their work was making a difference?"

        {
            "text": "The numbers tell part of the story: over 100 posts from stakeholders across\u00a0 X and Instagram alone. But what really matters is that we now have non-government voices, some embedded in traditionally sceptical communities, independently telling their audiences that government is listening, doing good work and helping save lives."

            "text": "This campaign reinforced something fundamental: halving knife crime demands we work beyond Whitehall\u2019s walls. This proved we can. The best ideas and authentic voices often come from outside Whitehall. Every weapon surrendered is a\u00a0 life potentially saved. That\u2019s what happens when we build relationships, show respect and listen."
