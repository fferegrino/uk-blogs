The pilot approach included creating the UK digital identity and attributes trust framework (the trust framework), supplementary codes, an independent certification process, and a register of certified DVS providers."

For example, in April 2025, we launched a GOV.UK service for the public register, replacing the manual publication of spreadsheets of providers and their services. We\u2019ve continued \u2013\u00a0and continue \u2013\u00a0to improve that service over time."

They now are, so the DVS measures in the Data (Use and Access) Act \u2013 which became law in June \u2013 can now come into force as the next step. That means that, from today, many aspects of the pilot have been placed onto a statutory footing."
