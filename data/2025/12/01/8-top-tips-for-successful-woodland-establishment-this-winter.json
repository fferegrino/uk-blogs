Whether it\u2019s for timber, biodiversity, water quality or shelter, your objectives will influence your woodland design. Taking the time to plan gives you the basis for establishing a successful woodland."

These young trees establish quickly and adapt to their new environment. A 40-60cm whip can often catch up with a 6-foot tree within just a few years."
