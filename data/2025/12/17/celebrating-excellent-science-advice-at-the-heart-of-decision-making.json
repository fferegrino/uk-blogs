Every day, scientists, both within government and across the wider research community, contribute insights that help us address complex challenges, from public health through economic growth to environmental sustainability.\u00a0"

From shaping responses to national emergencies to informing long-term strategies on climate, technology and health, scientific insights ensure decisions are grounded in evidence \u2013 and we recognise the people and work that make this possible.\u00a0"

The Council\u2019s letter to the Prime Minister put emphasis on primary prevention \u2013 with the aim of reducing conditions such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\u00a0"

During the Covid-19 pandemic, it met around a hundred times. SAGE made a real difference because it gave us the information we needed to try and prevent spread in the first waves of the pandemic and it also allowed us to introduce the testing, the treatment and eventually the vaccines, which allowed us to get on top of Covid-19 and reduce the threat."

            "text": "Scientific advice from the Met Office also plays an important role within government. Modelling and data, from satellite observations in space and equipment on the ground, is essential for predicting weather and the impact of climate change \u2013 which is increasing the number of extreme weather events such as heatwaves or flooding. This helps us as a country and a community build resilience to those events, for instance by ensuring the rail network can cope with landslides from a heavy rainfall or that roads can cope with flash flooding."
