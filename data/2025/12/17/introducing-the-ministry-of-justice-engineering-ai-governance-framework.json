But if we use it without discipline, it'll start to undermine the basics of quality engineering. AI is just the next chapter in how we build software. Like compilers, version control and CI/CD before it, each made us faster and each needed us to learn a new way of working. That's what engineers do, and this framework will help us achieve it.\""
