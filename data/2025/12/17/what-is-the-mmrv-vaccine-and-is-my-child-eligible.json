These spots can be painful and appear all over the body. Most children with chickenpox will have a mild illness and recover after around a week. Some children may have a more serious illness and need to be admitted to hospital. In rare cases, children can develop serious complications including chest infection, fits, and encephalitis (brain inflammation)."

Complications include chest infections, fits, encephalitis (infection of the brain) and brain damage. It is more severe in babies under one year old, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Around 1 in 5,000 people who catch measles may die from complications."
