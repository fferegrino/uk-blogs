That review found that there was not a standard test for density and there were high rates of false positive results. The committee did not recommend additional screening at that time as there was not enough evidence of benefit. "

The BRAID study supports these findings. MRI, and possibly CEM, show potential to improve screening by detecting more cancers, as previously shown by other studies. However, interval cancer data from BRAID is not yet available."
