The new Act\u00a0is\u00a0central\u00a0to\u00a0the government's\u00a0Plan for Change,\u00a0representing\u00a0one of the most significant planning reforms in a generation.\u00a0The\u00a0Act also\u00a0represents\u00a0a milestone for Natural England, giving more opportunities to to deliver the housing and infrastructure this country needs while driving nature recovery on a larger scale than we have seen before. The new measures in the Act will help us to meet the ambitions of Natural England\u2019s new Strategy: Recovering Nature for Growth, Health and Security\u2019. In particular, they will support our ambition to \u201cBuild Better Places\u201d to ensure we build the greener homes and infrastructure we need while enabling nature to thrive all around us."

            "text": "We know the current planning system has not always delivered the outcomes we want, either for nature recovery, or for the development of homes and infrastructure that our country needs. \u00a0While this system has helped to protect many sites and species, it has not contributed to large scale nature recovery, nor has it worked well in addressing indirect, cumulative and widescale impacts such as pollution and habitat fragmentation, which cannot be dealt with case by case. That\u2019s why we welcome the reforms introduced by the new Planning and Infrastructure Act today."

The Secretary of State is given the power to direct projects outside of the development consent process. It also introduces a faster procedure for legal challenges.\u00a0\u00a0To play our part in this streamlined process, Natural England will strengthen our efforts into partnering with developers at the pre-application stages for those projects where the environmental risks and opportunities are greatest. Our advice will not just be on how to avoid or make good on harm, but also on how to seize opportunities for nature\u2019s recovery. \u00a0"

This means removing the need and cost of bespoke assessments for each individual development by giving developers the option to pay a levy. Natural England will use this pooled resource to deliver the strategic actions, as set out in an EDP, to address the impact that development has on a protected site or species."

All EDPs will be subject to public consultation and will then need to be approved by the Secretary of State. Once an EDP is in place in a specific area, developers can choose to meet their environmental obligations for the environmental features covered by that EDP by paying a levy, which Natural England will then use to deliver the conservation measures set out in the plan.\u00a0Where EDPs are not in place, for example where there are irreplaceable habitats, or developers choose not to use them, existing Habitats and other Regulations will continue to apply. They will also secure join-up, as EDPs will have regard to wider strategic plans and measures, such as Local Nature Recovery Strategies.\u00a0"
