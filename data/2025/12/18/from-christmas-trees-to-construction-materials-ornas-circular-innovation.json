Hugo explains how the business is still in the research and development stage, and the ORNA\u00ae team has already applied for a patent (GB2633822) for the process of reducing the carbon footprint using waste wood."

Hugo felt awful, convinced he'd \"jinxed\" Matthew with the wreath joke. When Matthew later called to say he was fine, they laughed about the coincidence, and this chance encounter became the foundation of their relationship. Hugo mentioned Matthew has gone on to become a mentor who\u2019s been not only a great source of knowledge and wisdom but also a great friend,"
