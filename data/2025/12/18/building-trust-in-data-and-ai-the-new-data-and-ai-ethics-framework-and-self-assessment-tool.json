As data-driven technologies continue to evolve, however, it\u2019s essential that guidance keeps pace to support their responsible development and use.That\u2019s why we\u2019ve refreshed the Data Ethics Framework - and developed a new self-assessment tool to support teams in making ethical decisions across the life cycle of their data and AI projects. The updated title is the Data and AI Ethics Framework, which reflects these changes."

Since its inception, it has been helping teams across the public sector and beyond in delivering data projects in fair, transparent and accountable ways.However, rapid advancements in AI are creating new and complex ethical challenges related to fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, safety, societal impact and sustainability. As a result, we\u2019ve updated the framework to ensure it remains relevant, and continues to support public trust in the government\u2019s use of data and data-driven technologies."
