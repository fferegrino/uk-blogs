Space debris poses real risks to satellites and space missions.\u00a0With thousands of satellites in orbit, and an increasing\u00a0number of missions launching every year,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0vital to minimise the creation of space debris and to develop technologies that can remove or avoid it. Sustainable practices include designing satellites to deorbit safely at the end of their lives, tracking objects in space to avoid collisions, and international cooperation to set standards for responsible behaviour.\u00a0"
