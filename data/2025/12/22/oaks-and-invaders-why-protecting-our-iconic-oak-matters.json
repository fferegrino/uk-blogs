But this year marks an unwelcome anniversary: 20 years since the arrival of a small, silent invader: the oak processionary moth (OPM)."

Roman emperors and Celtic kings wore crowns of oak leaves as symbols of honour and strength. Couples were wed beneath ancient oaks, trusting in the tree\u2019s longevity to bless their union."

Admired for their distinctive appearance, great size and long lifespans, these living landmarks are found and admired in deciduous woodlands, hillsides, ridgetops, parks and gardens across the country."

Oak trees are home to an extraordinary diversity of life, supporting thousands of species, and provide essential ecosystem services, offering cooling shade, shelter from wind and rain and stabilising the soil with their root systems.

Bats roost in holes and under loose bark, banqueting on a plethora of insects alongside birds like the great spotted woodpeckers, nuthatches and treecreepers. Wild primroses, bluebells and wild garlic all rely on the rich soil beneath oaks to grow and thrive."

            "text": "Native to central and southern Europe, the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea) gets its name from the characteristic way their caterpillars march nose-to-tail in a hungry procession along oak trunks and branches. These caterpillars feed on oak leaves, sometimes causing alarming defoliation to host trees, and leaving them vulnerable to other pests, diseases or drought."
        },
        {
            "text": "But OPM is not just a threat to the health of trees. It also has the potential to cause health problems in humans and animals. The caterpillars are covered in thousands of tiny toxic hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Reactions can range from mild rashes to breathing difficulties and eye irritations. These hairs can be carried on the wind or left behind in nests on tree trunks, which often persist long after the caterpillars have left."

Since then, the population has slowly expanded, particularly across Greater London and surrounding counties, despite sustained efforts to contain it."

            "text": "The Forestry Commission, alongside local authorities, landowners and tree care specialists, have been at the forefront of tackling OPM since its arrival. Over the past two decades, our response has involved a combination of surveillance, treatment, improving regulation and public awareness campaigns \u2013 monitoring outbreaks through trapping and inspection, targeted pesticide and nest removal programmes, tighter plant import controls and guidance to help the public identify and report sightings."
