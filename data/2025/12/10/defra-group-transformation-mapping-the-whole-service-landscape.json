We spoke to service teams from organisations across Defra group and analysed existing materials like team Mural boards, service lists, SharePoint sites and strategy documents. Where documentation or data did not exist, we did desk-based research, including reviewing guidance content and services on GOV.UK, to map some services."

We\u2019ve been sharing our work through week notes and show and tells to ensure we\u2019re working in the open. We\u2019ve had valuable conversations about the purpose and potential benefits of understanding whole services, and how our colleagues\u2019 work across Defra connects and aligns."
