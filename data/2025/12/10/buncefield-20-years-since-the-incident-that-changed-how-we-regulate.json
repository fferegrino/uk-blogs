The event was reported around the world and was heard as far away as the Netherlands. Fires burned for five days, destroying much of the depot, damaging nearby businesses and properties, and injuring more than 40 people. Thankfully, no lives were lost, but many were affected.\u00a0"

As part of the COMAH (Control of Major Accident Hazards) Competent Authority, we worked closely with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate what happened and assess the environmental impact.\u00a0"

The investigation uncovered a range of technical and management failings. Five companies were found to have committed offences, resulting in fines and costs of \u00a39.5 million, including \u00a31.3 million in fines for pollution offences. This was a record at the time for a single incident in the UK.\u00a0"
