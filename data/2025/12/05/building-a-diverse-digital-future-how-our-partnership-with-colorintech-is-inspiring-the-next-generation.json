As demand grows for a digitally skilled workforce across the public sector, we are focused on reaching new audiences and encouraging people from all backgrounds to pursue rewarding careers in digital and data. As part of the government\u2019s blueprint for modern digital government, where one in ten civil servants will work in digital and data roles, strategic partnerships and outreach are essential. They help us reach underrepresented communities, demystify digital careers, and position the Civil Service as a place where diverse talent can thrive."

These efforts are helping to build a workforce that reflects the communities we serve and supports the Civil Service\u2019s transformation into a digitally skilled, future-ready organisation."
