The MMRV vaccine protects against 4 serious diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (known as varicella). The MMRV vaccine has been safely used for over a decade and is already part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule in several countries, including Canada, Australia and Germany."

Children born on or after 1 September 2022 will be offered 1 or 2 doses of the MMRV vaccine as part of their routine vaccinations. A single MMRV catch-up dose will be offered to children born between 1 January 2020 and 31 August 2022 if they haven't already had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it. This dose will be offered between November 2026 and March 2028. More detail on the eligibility can be found in our blog post: what is the MMRV vaccine and is my child eligible?"

This will help to prevent the spread of Hib in the community and maintain herd immunity. It offers protection against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib and hepatitis B."

This will help provide children with protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox from a younger age, reducing the likelihood of outbreaks and helping to increase uptake of the vaccine.\u00a0"

This is particularly important as, since the vaccine was introduced in 2015, there have been increasing number of cases of meningitis B in young babies who had not yet gained the protection from the second dose of the vaccine. JCVI advised that it would be beneficial to move the second dose of MenB vaccine to 12 weeks of age to provide earlier protection."

            "text": "The first dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, previously offered at 12 weeks, will now be offered at 16 weeks, so that the MenB vaccine can be given earlier. This was introduced from 1 July 2025. Although your baby will get the pneumococcal vaccine 4 weeks later than previously, they will still be protected. This is because pneumococcal disease is now very rare in young babies, due to high vaccination rates in the wider community, which provides herd immunity."
