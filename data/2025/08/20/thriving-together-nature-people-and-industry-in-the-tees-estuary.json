Through the passing juggernauts and across the brine fields to my right, an abundance of industrial structures dominate the skyline, on my left, three Harbour seals glide along an estuary channel and playfully galumph their way out onto the nearest mudflat, flopping down to have a post-breakfast snooze in the sunshine."

            "text": "The Tees Estuary is a special place for both nature and people. Surrounded by large urban conurbations, the estuary and coastline draw people to enjoy its beauty and reap the physical, mental and wellbeing benefits it gifts to us. The estuary also carries an important industrial legacy that interconnects the northeast coast and the North Sea at the forefront of Britain\u2019s Industrial Revolution, it\u2019s maritime power and the birth of the Railway. Today, industry remains crucial as the region leads the way in the nation\u2019s transition to green energy and Net Zero."

            "text": "Complexity frames the estuary. Over the past 300-years, 90% of the estuary has been built upon to support agricultural and industrial growth, often with devastating effects on the environment. By the late 1970s, the River Tees was declared ecologically dead, with the riverbeds still trapping toxic waste from past human activity."

            "text": "Yet remarkably, nature has persevered. The estuary is home to an incredible array of wildlife and habitats, including internationally important bird populations, coastal habitats, sand dunes systems, grasslands, woodlands and wetlands. From the tiniest of rare money spiders through to critically endangered European Eel, the summer-visiting Little Terns to the iconic Tees Harbour Seal colony at Seal Sands at Teesmouth National Nature Reserve - nature has built a home here.\u00a0"

            "text": "In recognition of its biodiversity significance, this landscape carries some of the highest formal conservation designations, however many habitats remain fragmented and in an unfavourable condition, due to poor air and water quality, nutrient overload and recreational pressure."

This landmark moment in the Tees Estuary\u2019s environmental future facilitates organisations to pool their skills and expertise to join up nature recovery at landscape scale. \u00a0Our vision is for the Tees Estuary to be known for its nature, people and industry \u2013 where all are thriving in equilibrium, and for nature to be part of every aspect of life for the people who live in, work in or visit the Tees."

The route travels through time, linking iron age, mediaeval and wartime heritage found along the route with today\u2019s natural landscape. We\u2019ve co-designed the route with local communities and are seeking funding for completion and interactive interpretation."

We wanted to learn more about their prevalence so were very excited when the survey revealed an abundant population -of regional and national significance - across the Tees Bay and Durham Coast dunes systems!"
