I recently worked with someone on our Uni Ready Programme, supporting them through university choices and more. They said our work helped them understand the process much better; they've just finished their first year and are thriving.Finance is a huge barrier for many. At Become, I also provide guidance on university bursaries, grants, and additional funding sources. I recently helped one young person secure funding from the Leatherseller's Foundation, which will make a huge impact when they start their course this September."
