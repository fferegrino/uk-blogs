Sometimes that leads to a surprising but important conclusion - that building a new service isn\u2019t always the right thing to do."

In agile delivery, the discovery and alpha phases exist to help us investigate whether a service is viable, valuable and feasible. In some cases, the most responsible and user-centred decision we can make is to stop."
