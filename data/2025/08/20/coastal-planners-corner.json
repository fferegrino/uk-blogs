From the Port of Tyne to the Yorkshire Marine Nature Partnership, and local councils including Durham, North Yorkshire, and Sunderland, these early conversations are helping to build trust across all sectors, and laying the foundation for stronger collaboration, which is essential for integrating marine plans into terrestrial local plans and wider decision-making."

Chloe and I have been invited to develop and deliver a workshop where we\u2019ll introduce the benefits of marine plans, share insights from our own planning process, and use the MSP Challenge tool to demonstrate how planning can help manage competing demands on the sea in a sustainable way."

The meeting brought together parliamentarians, policymakers, and cross-sector professionals, to discuss what a targeted UK Fishing and Coastal Growth Fund could look like, and the steps needed to ensure the fund becomes an effective vehicle for investment in the future of our fishing and seafood communities. The Minister for Food Security and Rural Affairs, Daniel Zeichner MP, opened the event."

This project includes refurbishing the ageing sea defences to protect around 3,000 homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure from rising flood risks driven by climate change and sea level rise. In some parts of the Sheerness and Queenborough area land lies below the high tide level, making effective flood defence essential for community safety and resilience."

Ahead of developing the East Marine Plan, she has been researching water quality issues through meetings and events, including a water governance workshop with DEFRA colleagues and a water quality summit hosted by LGA Coastal Special Interest Group.

The session clarified issues arising from a recent planning application, which had led to some confusion regarding the application of marine plans. Councillors found the session valuable, asking constructive questions throughout. We hope to return later this year to run a Marine Spatial Planning Challenge exercise to build on this engagement."
