Hats and gloves are an easy and rewarding find for dogs, as they carry a lot of human scent. Or you can use an old sock if you don\u2019t want dog hair and slobber on your best accessories!"

For many years the Kennel Club and Natural England have been encouraging local councils to be much clearer about the best places for dog walking, rather than just saying where you can\u2019t go. For example, these projects in the south of England make it easy to find an enjoyable and environmentally-friendly dog walk:"

Never go in between groups of cows, calves or horses \u2013 go around them and divert off the path if need be. If you feel threatened or are chased, release your dog to get to safety separately."

General waste bins in the outdoors, at home, or where you are staying are fine for bagged poo; you are not restricted to just using dedicated dog poo bins."
