As part of our independent work programme we have just begun a new detailed study into how the benefits system influences the decisions young adults aged 16- to 18-year-old \u2013 and their families \u2013 make around education, apprenticeship and work."

For young people in low-income households the decision to move from full\u2011time education into an apprenticeship can \u2013 but not always \u2013 reduce their parent(s) entitlement to means-tested support. For young carers, care leavers, or those with disabilities, the implications can be particularly complex. And there is variation in the support available in different parts of the UK."

            "text": "Our project will draw on existing research and engagement with policy officials at the Department for Work and Pensions and devolved administrations in order to map how support for different choices made by young adults varies across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We also want to understand the lived experience behind the formal rules of the system and the relevant statistics. To ensure this, we will bring in voices from those with experience of these issues including, most importantly, directly from parents and young people themselves. We will also host roundtables with charities, including organisations working with young carers, care leavers and disabled young people. And we will meet with think tanks and others who have done work in this important, though somewhat neglected, policy area \u2013 especially in the context of the raising of the education and training leaving age up to 18 in 2013."

            "text": "Our project is also timely. There is increasing concern about the rising number of young people in the UK who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). The DWP\u2019s recent Green Paper includes a discussion of reforms specifically targeted at 16- to 24-year-olds, and the Government has a new Youth Guarantee for 18- to 21-year-olds in England. By way of a response to some of these issues, DWP has just appointed a Director for Youth and NEET, Alex Fitzpatrick. We look forward to working with Alex and her colleagues as our research proceeds through the summer and autumn, with a plan to send our findings \u2013 on what is working well and any weaknesses that we uncover \u2013 and recommendations for any reforms needed to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions by the end of the year."
