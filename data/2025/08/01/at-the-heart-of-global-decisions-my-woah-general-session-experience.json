These one-on-one discussions between countries offer a valuable opportunity to address trade, animal health, regulatory concerns, and wider cooperation. They\u2019re practical, often fast-paced conversations where countries can clarify technical questions, iron out issues, and lay the groundwork for future agreements. In total, the UK delegation took part in 14 bilateral meetings with countries. This level of engagement speaks volumes about the UK\u2019s active role on the international stage and its commitment to strengthening relationships that support our farming and food industries. For the UK, these dialogues are vital in opening new markets and enhancing trust in our veterinary and regulatory systems"

In the final two days of the WOAH General Session, delegates from nearly every country cast vote to update international standards-deciding on everything from disease case definitions to recommended diagnostic tests. These decisions shape how nations manage outbreaks, regulate trade, and protect animal welfare. It is a fast-moving but carefully orchestrated process, bult on months of preparation. This is where Raquel, the UK WOAH Focal Point Coordinator for Standards, made a remarkable impact."
