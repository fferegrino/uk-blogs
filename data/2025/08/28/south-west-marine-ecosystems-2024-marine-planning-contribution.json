            "text": "The marine planning section of the SWME report advocates for marine planning and aims to increase its visibility among public audiences who may not be familiar with marine plans or their value. It also seeks to highlight the challenges and opportunities that marine planning presents, particularly in managing a busy and diverse marine environment."

            "text": "The Marine Planning team have been involved from the very beginning of the yearly SWME process, which begins in the autumn. Initial discussions and scoping took place in autumn 2024, where Ellie and Mae began collaborating with the SWME steering group to shape the direction of the marine planning content to ensure it aligned with the broader themes of the report. This early engagement helped establish a clear and coordinated plan, creating a collaborative approach for working together throughout the year."

            "text": "Throughout the year Ellie and Mae participated in regular steering group meetings which played a key role in coordinating the SWME webinar, annual conference, and report series. These meetings also facilitated ongoing discussions around the development of SWME, including the evolution of the management section."

            "text": "From a marine planning perspective, the section serves to outline recent developments in the South West Marine Plans and share relevant evidence projects from 2024. It also encourages collaboration with researchers and academics by showcasing MMO\u2019s evidence needs and processes, with the long-term goal of ensuring that SWME data can be used within the MMO\u2019s reporting systems. This includes upskilling contributors to better understand how their research can support marine planning and policy."
