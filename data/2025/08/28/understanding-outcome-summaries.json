As part of this, we regulate early years providers to make sure they\u2019re providing safe and secure environments for children to develop and learn in. This means making sure that they meet the requirements for registration, as set out in the early years foundation stage (EYFS) statutory framework. Sometimes, we need to take action to make sure a provider is meeting those requirements."
