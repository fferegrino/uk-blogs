        {
            "text": "The way you plant and manage trees can support their ability to protect water. For capturing dissolved pollutants like nitrate and phosphate, you typically plant trees closer together, which encourages them to draw up more nutrients and promote soil infiltration (where water on the surface enters the ground) and thereby soil retention. To trap sediment and particles in run-off you can create more open tree canopy and thicker ground vegetation, like those typically found on woodland edges."

        {
            "text": "Therefore, managing your riverside woodland should focus on encouraging natural processes that restore, protect and maintain riparian (trees situated close to water courses) and aquatic habitats. Well-managed woods can also achieve a better woodland structure and protect retained open water habitats like ponds and wetlands, in which wildlife and biodiversity depend on."

        {
            "text": "Woodland soils are typically better structured than in other land uses, allowing more rainfall to enter and pass through, rather than running off and contributing to flooding. Trees, shrubs and deadwood on the surface also slow the flow of floodwater and delay its passage to watercourses."

        {
            "text": "There are intervention opportunities to enhance these benefits: creating informal flood storage features such as ponds and scrapes can increase floodwater storage. Less intensive restocking can improve soil health and water infiltration. Blocking in-field drains when you\u2019re creating a new woodland, can help towards restoring its natural hydrology and contribute to flood management."

        {
            "text": "Natural defences like these are becoming more important as climate change brings more extreme summer downpours. Trees protect soil from erosion, preventing silt from clogging up river channels \u2013 which keeps rivers flowing freely when floods hit."

        {
            "text": "Installing man-made leaky woody structures can slow water flow \u2013 in nature these are features of a woodland stream sustained by fallen trees or woody debris from riparian woodland. Forest roads, embankments, culverts and other planned forest structures can hold back flood flows in existing woods and forests if they are working well."

        {
            "text": "Woody material in waterways needs careful management, especially near bridges and culverts that could get blocked and lead to local flooding. While man-made leaky woody structures work well in flash flood catchments, you should always get permission from your lead flood authority before installing them."
