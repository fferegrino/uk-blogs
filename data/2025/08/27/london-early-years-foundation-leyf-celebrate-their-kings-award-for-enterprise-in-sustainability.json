As a social enterprise deeply rooted in creating positive impact, we were inspired by the values the Awards champion, especially around sustainability and enterprise with purpose. The Awards have increasingly become a beacon for organisations like ours, who want to use their platform to lead change."

            "text": "We applied because we wanted to shine a light on the often overlooked but vital role that Early Years Education and Care (EYEC) plays in building a more sustainable future. Through this award, we hoped to amplify the message that sustainability in EYEC is not an afterthought, it\u2019s a necessity. It\u2019s central to how we support children, families, and our communities every single day. In fact, our whole-system approach is driven by the London Institute of Early Years, LEYF\u2019s dedicated research and training hub, and its: Action for Sustainability in Education, Community of Practice which is a vibrant network focused on embedding the three pillars of sustainability \u2013 economic, social, and environmental sustainability into daily practice."

It gave us the opportunity to pull together all the strands of our sustainability work from our ISO14001 and Planet Mark achievements, to partnerships with organisations like City Harvest, Fashion Enter, Green Bottoms, and Bikeworks. The application was a chance to step back, gather evidence, and celebrate how far we\u2019ve come. It reminded us that sustainability is a journey and one worth shouting about."
