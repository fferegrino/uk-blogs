It is home to many different sea-bed types, including sand, mud, bedrock and boulders. There are also some features that are unique to the deep-sea, like cold-water coral reefs and bioherms. Bioherms are rock structures made up of the remains of marine organisms set inside mineral rock. Corals and bioherms provide complex 3D structures which act as refuges for species like brittle stars and provide a hard surface where non-mobile species like sponges can attach and colonise.\u00a0"
