            "text": "Spurdog (also known as the spiny dogfish, scientific name Squalus acanthias) is a type of small shark found in oceans around the world. It can travel long distances and has been an important species for commercial fishing in the past."

            "text": "However, the number of spurdog in the Northeast Atlantic (the part of the Atlantic Ocean near Europe) dropped significantly in the early 2000\u2019s compared to how many there were in the 1950s and 60s. Because of this sharp decline, governments introduced strict fishing rules to help the population recover."

            "text": "From 2010 to 2022, fishermen were not allowed to catch spurdog on purpose, and the total amount of spurdog that could be legally caught, called the Total Allowable Catch (TAC), was set to zero. The only exception was a small amount that could be kept if the fish were accidentally caught while fishing for other species. This was part of what\u2019s called a Bycatch Avoidance Scheme, which is a program designed to reduce the number of unwanted fish caught by accident (called bycatch)."
        },
        {
            "text": "In 2017, spurdog was officially listed as a prohibited species, which meant it was illegal to keep or land any spurdog, even if caught by accident."
        },
        {
            "text": "But in 2022, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), a group of scientists that gives advice on ocean health and fish stocks, said that spurdog populations had improved enough to allow limited fishing again. So, for 2023 and 2024, a controlled amount of spurdog fishing (a TAC) was allowed, and the species was no longer officially prohibited."
        },
        {
            "text": "Even with this change, a careful, precautionary approach was still needed to protect the population. One key measure was that any spurdog longer than 100cm must still be protected. These larger sharks are usually females that can produce many pups, so protecting them helps the population stay healthy and grow."

            "text": "In April 2023, the UK government's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), asked scientists at Cefas to carry out a research project on spurdog. The goal was to help manage the spurdog, a species that was fully protected until 2023 but is now allowed to be caught in limited amounts under new commercial fishing rules. Even though fishing is now allowed, the larger spurdog, which are usually females that can produce the most and biggest pups, are still protected and cannot be landed."
