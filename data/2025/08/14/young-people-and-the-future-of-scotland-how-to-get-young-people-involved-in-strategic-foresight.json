Recognising that young people have the longest stake in Scotland\u2019s future - and may experience emerging trends differently - the project team wanted to capture their perspectives."

The day was co-designed with young people and delivered in partnership with Demos Helsinki and the Scottish Youth Parliament. Co-creation was a core foundation of the methodology, with young people designing tools and methods, leading the project and participating in fun and creative activities, which helped engage participants throughout the day. These included a creative task to design an artefact from the future and an immersive gallery approach to exploring potential future states. The positive feedback received after the event is a testament of the success of the approach. Young people found that engaging in futures thinking was empowering, helped build their confidence and develop skills, with one participant stating: \u201cOur involvement ensures decisions reflect the needs of our generation, making the outcomes from projects like this more forward-thinking and impactful to those it will actually impact.\u201d"

One of the youth participants suggested: \u201cStop dealing with climate change at the surface and fix the root causes\u201d, while others argued that fair wealth distribution and strategic investment are essential to funding initiatives that protect the environment and strengthen communities. Moreover, they highlighted the importance of political and digital education in empowering citizens to identify misinformation and build trust in decision-makers, underscoring a growing awareness among Scotland\u2019s youth that systemic change requires collaboration, transparency, and long-term thinking."

The GO-Science\u2019s Futures Procurement Framework and the Scottish Government\u2019s Children and Young People\u2019s Participation Framework were easy to use and complemented each other well."
