The highest number of those are for A levels, with 814,335 being taken by 313,190 students in 137 different subjects. A further 50,475 AS level results have been issued today as well."

            "text": "This year the number of 18-year-olds is up on 2024, and there are some small but noticeable patterns in the type of qualifications they have chosen. The number of A levels being taken this year has actually fallen slightly since 2024, by about 2,500, and the trends in the choices of subject have continued. STEM subjects such as mathematics, further maths and physics have risen in popularity, even in a slightly smaller cohort, whereas some arts and humanities subjects have declined."

            "text": "There has been a small increase in pass rates. We can\u2019t say for sure why this is the case, but there are some factors that could be part of the story."

            "text": "Based on prior attainment, such as these students\u2019 GCSE grades, and relative to the national population of 18-year-olds, this year\u2019s cohort of A level students seems to be stronger than last year\u2019s."
        },
        {
            "text": "Moreover, this year\u2019s A level students made their post-16 choices in 2023, which was the first year GCSE grading returned to normal after the pandemic. That could mean those students had a more accurate picture of their strengths to guide their choices. We can\u2019t be certain but it may be that some students who might have taken A levels in previous years instead opted for some of the level 3 vocational options, such as applied general qualifications (for example BTECs) or T Levels."

            "text": "It is important to emphasise that while each year\u2019s cohort of students will be slightly different, the standard of work needed to get a particular grade remains comparable with previous years. This means any change in numbers achieving a grade is entirely due to a change in student performance, not a change in the standard expected. You can find out more about this process here."

We have also published interactive visualisations of\u00a0outcomes by centre type, variability in school and college A level results, A level outcomes in England, A level grade combinations, and an interactive map of England showing A level results in different subjects by grade and county."
