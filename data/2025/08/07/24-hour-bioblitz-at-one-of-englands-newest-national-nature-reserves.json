            "text": "The declaration, which brought together charities, private estates, and local councils, showcases Kent\u2019s significant contribution to nature recovery and provides opportunity for people to experience, engage with and enjoy nature, whilst recovering nationally important biodiversity."

            "text": "Natural England were joined by the Birling Estate, Silverhand Estate, Medway Council, Woodland Trust, Kent Wildlife Trust, Kent Field Club, the Kent Downs National Landscape and University College London for the event. Having been kindly invited onto both Birling Estate and The Silverhand Estate Vineyard (the largest single holding organic vineyard in the UK), the teams were able to record over 500 species, including the incredibly rare Maidstone Mining Bee; a species of bee only recently discovered, thought previously extinct in the UK."

This incredible number reflects the fantastic land management taking place across the farm. During the event, Richard Moyse, Chair of The Kent Field Club, spotted a nationally scarce Rufous Grasshopper:"

            "text": "But the new National Nature Reserve (NNR) is not just about rare species. NNRs are built on three core pillars: science, nature and people. Whilst Natural England is dedicated to the restoration and protection of our natural environment, people remain at the forefront of this work."

            "text": "Stretching from Gravesend to the Medway Valley, The NKW&D is the first of over 220 NNRs to include a vineyard, demonstrating how environmental responsibility can work hand in hand with growth and local business. The NNR is also located near several large urban populations and will deliver access to green spaces to communities who might otherwise have limited access to the countryside."

The reserve sits within the \u2018Chalk to Coast\u2019 (C2C) Project, an ambitious, farmer-led initiative connecting Kent\u2019s diverse landscapes from the chalk downlands to coastal habitats. Three established farm clusters (Hoo Peninsula, Swale, and North Medway Gap) have come together within the C2C to help farmers and partners work more cohesively in their locality, deliver greater benefits for soil, water and wildlife.
