However, the virus has now spread to new territories and is affecting millions of people worldwide. Major outbreaks have occurred in the Indian Ocean islands, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and parts of the Pacific. Even temperate regions like France and Italy have experienced smaller but significant outbreaks, and this year there have been significant outbreaks in China and the French Outermost Regions of Reunion and Mayotte. \u00a0"

            "text": "Chikungunya spreads through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species. Mosquitoes breed in natural and human-made sources of standing and stagnant water such blocked gutters and drains, litter, tarpaulins, open buckets, bins, plant pots and discarded items like tyres, and these are a risk factor for transmission if left around human habitation. Unlike malaria-carrying mosquitoes that are active at night, these insects are most active during the day, and particularly at dusk and dawn. This timing makes them troublesome for travellers engaged in daytime activities.\u00a0"

Many patients also experience muscle pain, headaches, sensitivity to light, and distinctive skin rashes. While most people recover fully within 1 to 2 weeks, the joint pain can persist for months or even years in some cases, with up to 12% of patients still experiencing discomfort 3 years after infection.\u00a0"

The most effective approach involves rigorous mosquito bite prevention measures. This includes using repellents containing DEET or picardin on exposed skin, and wearing light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing that covers arms and legs.\u00a0 Use of insect repellents should be according to the manufacturer's instructions, and care should be taken for babies and young children.\u00a0\u00a0"

Avoiding areas with natural and artificial water containers can help reduce exposure risk.

Our Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology group (MEZE) monitor and assess new and existing species and the threat they pose to public health, advising the government on appropriate measures. The Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (EIZ) Team provide epidemic intelligence, while the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) provides clinical advice and laboratory testing of samples. The Travel Health Team collaborates with the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) to translate all of this information into comprehensive advice for health professionals and members of the public."
