The latest evidence on screening for SCID, including NHS England\u2019s (NHSE\u2019s) findings from the ISE during the 30-month evaluation period up to March 2024, were presented to UK NSC members at their June 2025 meeting."

            "text": "SCID is a group of rare inherited disorders that result in low numbers of T-cell lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and that prevents the body from fighting infection properly. There are usually no symptoms when an affected baby is born. The condition can develop very quickly and almost always results in death in the first year unless the baby receives a bone marrow transplant to repair their damaged immune system."

        {
            "text": "Screening for SCID, as part of the newborn blood spot (NBS) screening programme, looks for babies with low numbers of white blood cells as a sign that they may have the condition. Early detection means steps can be taken to avoid the risk of infections, improving the success of transplant treatment."

NHSE\u2019s report on the 30-month ISE evaluation period found that screening detected 10 babies with the condition who would otherwise have gone undetected until infections developed, thus preventing serious illness."
        },
        {
            "text": "However, it also detected hundreds of babies with low white cell numbers who were subsequently found to be well. Babies in this group derived no benefit from screening. and many families were put through the stress of being told their baby may have a life-threatening disorder, when this turned out not to be true."

            "text": "The 2025 SCHARR cost-effectiveness study estimates that screening for SCID does not meet accepted cost effectiveness thresholds as a standalone addition to the NBS screening programme. However, it also estimates that it would become cost effective if screening for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was introduced or trialled at the same time, and using the same testing system."
