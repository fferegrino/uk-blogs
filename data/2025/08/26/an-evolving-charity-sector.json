Charities respond to emerging needs, innovate to tackle new challenges (COVID being a clear example), and adapt quickly to change.

Innovation is one of several factors behind a surge in new registration applications. Also driving registration applications are the ongoing cost-of-living squeeze and financial hardship, global events such as conflicts or disasters, as well as organisations registered as Community Interest Companies looking to convert from a social enterprise to a charity."

In 2024-25, that number climbed even higher to 9,840 \u2013 an increase of 9% on the previous year. This data indicates that on average per working day the Commission received almost 40 registration applications while registering around 20 new charities from existing applications, alongside removing around 16 organisations from the Register."

Sadly, some people seek to exploit the status of \u2018charity\u2019 for personal gain and we regularly spot and stop sham applications.
