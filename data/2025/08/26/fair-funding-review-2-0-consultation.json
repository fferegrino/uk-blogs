We also expect that by the end of the multi-year Settlement,\u00a0 areas with high deprivation will have on average higher CSP per capita than less deprived area.\u00a0"

            "text": "Local authorities focussing only on their percentage change in allocation need to consider their current CSP compared to other areas with similar levels of need, and their final allocation by the end of the multi-year Settlement. This is because\u00a0local authorities have different variables that may impact their current financial position ahead of transitioning to their new allocation. Allocations are currently calculated using the outdated 13-14 Settlement Needs Assessment, which includes a number of measures that do not accurately reflect areas current needs, like: the\u00a0Business Rates Retention system that was designed to be reset but was not; transition protections which were built into allocations; and needs formulae which were last updated in 2013/14 and have not been updated to account for change, including varying rates of population growth across the country, over the last decade.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Another variable was the \u00a3600m Recovery Grant delivered as part of the 25-26 Settlement. The Recovery Grant was an interim measure that targeted funding towards areas with greater need and demand for services (using deprivation as a proxy), and less ability to raise income locally. Whilst the Recovery Grant did not capture need in the same way that our proposed new modelling will, it meant that the authorities in receipt of the grant had a head start in moving towards their target allocations.\u00a0\u00a0"
