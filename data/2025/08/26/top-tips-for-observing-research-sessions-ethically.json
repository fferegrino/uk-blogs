Equally important is ensuring that these ethical principles are applied in practice, to protect and respect participants throughout the entire research process. User research sessions are an invaluable tool for understanding the needs, behaviours, and experiences of participants."

Participants are guided through specific tasks, such as navigating support resources or applying for business guidance, while researchers watch how they use the site and listen to their thoughts. All that feedback helps improve the site, making it simpler for everyone to get the advice and support they need to start and grow their business."

Let the researcher lead the way, and avoid side chats with participants that could skew their answers. Security and privacy are key: no personal details, no rogue recordings, and stick to pseudonyms for participants. Observing research sessions ethically isn\u2019t just about rules or ticking boxes; it\u2019s about doing the right thing for the people involved."

Begin with respect, act with responsibility and always centre the participant \u2013 as their openness is not just data, but a contribution to our understanding. By observing thoughtfully, you help ensure that research remains a safe and valuable space for everyone involved."
