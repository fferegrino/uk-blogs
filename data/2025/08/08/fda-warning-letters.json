        {
            "text": "The MHRA has reviewed its current approach. IAG and DMRC note that these letters are in the public domain and takes the view all manufacturing and wholesale licence holders, as well as API (Active pharmaceutical ingredient) registration holders should be reviewing these warning letters as part of their ongoing quality assessment of suppliers and contract manufacturers. While technical agreements between third party suppliers should be sufficiently robust to ensure these are provided as a matter of course, IAG and DMRC regards it to be prudent to check as part of routine qualification and re-qualification activities."

            "text": "In future, MHRA will not be contacting licence holders as a matter of routine and companies should ensure they have measures in place to review and risk assess USFDA Warning Letters. Should this risk assessment require notification to MHRA then this could be via the DMRC (if medicines are defective) and to IAG (in regard to ongoing regulatory compliance).\u00a0"
