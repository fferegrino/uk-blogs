            "text": "Civil Service Live (CSL) is a great way to learn more about how government works, what other departments are focussing on, and network with colleagues across the board. I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who\u2019s joined the Civil Service recently, and anyone who wants to raise their head from their day-to-day work to collaborate with change makers across government."

            "text": "At previous events I\u2019ve focused on learning about the fallout from the conflict in Ukraine. I\u2019ve attended everything from Dame Melinda Simmons sharing her experience of being the ambassador to Kyiv during Russia\u2019s invasion, to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government talk about Homes for Ukraine, to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport teams who made sure Eurovision 2023 would honour the winners of the 2022 contest and still go ahead."

It\u2019s fascinating to see how these events come together to incorporate thousands of years of history."

            "text": "I shared how Defra group is using AI to identify lesions in cattle hooves, and flora and fauna in the seabed. HMRC has implemented chat bots because the helplines are so busy. Some GPs are using ambient voice transcription during patient appointments. A platform called Minute is being trialled in local authorities to create minutes and transcripts. Another platform called Parlex is being used to predict parliamentary responses to a given policy. "

            "text": "Attending this year\u2019s packed talk from Cabinet Office's Government Security Group showed me how hard our colleagues are working to keep us safe\u2014not only the more than half a million Civil Servants in the UK, but our friends and families too. I care and understand much more than I used to, and I\u2019m going to put my learnings into place."

        {
            "text": "So much of security is about people\u2014human error, trust between colleagues, dissatisfaction at work. As a line manager, I can take steps to cultivate psychological safety so my direct reports can come to me if they\u2019ve made a mistake, or spot a security breach, and know that I will take the right actions. I can role model and reward good security behaviours. I can intervene to make things better if colleagues aren\u2019t happy in their roles."
