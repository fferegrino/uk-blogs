Therefore, COAST seeks to understand how SNI data is collected, collated, stored and shared across government organisations across the UK, Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. Recognising the private sector's central role as SNI data owners, users and experts, we are also keen to understand and map out government-to-private sector relationships and benefit from their expert insights."
