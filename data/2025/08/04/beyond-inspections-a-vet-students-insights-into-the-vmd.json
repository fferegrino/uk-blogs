Far from being isolated, the organisation works closely with national and international partners, playing a key role in influencing policy, contributing to global standards, and responding to emerging issues. It was fascinating to observe how integrated and forward-thinking the organisation is, something I had not fully appreciated before.\u00a0"

Whether in clinical practice or beyond, the insights I have gained from the VMD will undoubtedly shape the way I approach veterinary medicine.\u00a0"
