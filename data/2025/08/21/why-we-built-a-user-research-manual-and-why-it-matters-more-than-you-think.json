Where these services are incredibly complex, with a lot of dependencies and assumptions, a lot can get lost. In Defra, we have a dedicated research operations team to take these user research practices and scale them to have greater impact across the organisation."

There is a need for a department to standardise the way research is approached to support user researchers to do their job well, understand the intricacies of the department, and hit research deadlines"

Across Defra, researchers were asking the same questions, facing the same challenges, and often turning to user research leads or the research operations teams for guidance. We needed a place to bring that knowledge together, not as a rulebook, but as a living, evolving guide."
