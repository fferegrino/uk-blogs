We speak with Josh Shipp, Head of Operations at HMCTS, and Akasa Pradhan, Senior Education Manager at Young Citizens to hear how mock trials are building confidence, breaking down misconceptions and helping young people see the justice system not as something distant, but as something they can be part of."
