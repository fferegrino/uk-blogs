One in particular comes to mind \u2013 a trip to Southeast Asia following the classic backpacker route. As I think of the turquoise waters and pad Thai, I'm reflecting on the role that intellectual property (IP) plays in these adventures."

Osprey has built its reputation on quality outdoor gear, and they protect that reputation through registered trade marks like UK00003971574. Trade marks are the legal shields that prevent other companies from copying brand names and logos \u2013 when trusting a backpack to carry my belongings for months, I want to be sure I'm buying the real thing."

Innovation makes this easier than ever, with inventions such as one that turns ordinary bathroom scales into accurate luggage weighers at home. One example is patent GB2627751A, a luggage weighing apparatus. Patents give the inventor exclusive rights to their innovations for up to 20 years."

Patent\u00a0GB2549192A covers an autonomous cleaning system which includes a robotic cleaner  that cleans a portion of the interior chamber, may have a debris collector and agitator, such as a vacuum cleaner, a dispenser for dispensing fluid onto the floor and an ultraviolet light to irradiate a portion of the chamber during the cleaning cycle. Boeing protects systems and methods for cleaning aircraft interiors, helping maintain the hygiene standards that keep millions of passengers healthy."

Something that reassures me is packing a tracker like an Apple AirTag. This means that as soon as I land, I can feel at ease seeing that my bag has made it across the world with me. Apple have many patents: one example covering elements of the wirelessly locatable tag technology is EP3979410A1."

Apps like Hostel World, help me to find quality accommodation that ticks these boxes. They keep their app\u2019s branding protected with trade marks such as UK00914091649. When staying in a hostel and sharing a room with strangers, keeping my valuables safe is a priority. Patents like GB2496705A for an inflatable pillow with a storage compartment allow me to sleep safe and sound knowing my valuable are hidden safely."

Meanwhile, the branding on the alcohol that goes into those tropical cocktails can be registered trade marks, helping me to identify ingredients that I know and trust."
