This training was more technical with hands on bench training, and I must admit such training is what a Lab testing officer must be exposed to. The Bacteriology Lab capacity and the set up was very conducive and well prepared for the training. At this juncture, I would also like to acknowledge the effort of the trainers, the level of knowledge with respect to AMR/AST you have imparted to us is commendable. Also, I would like to thank all the staff of NParks Animal & Plant Health Center who have assisted in one way or the other. \u201d"

The delegates\u2019 commitment and dedication were evident and I hope that the sense of unity continues after the event, through the AMR community of practice and collaboration. We received excellent support from the host laboratory, Singapore NParks, making the event a great success. From the initiation of the project, they have been very professional and proactive, and we are very appreciative of their contribution.\u201d"
