Since then, significant progress has been made in embedding this approach across our capabilities. However, the evolving threat landscape demands continued vigilance and adaptation.\u00a0"

            "text": "In today's interconnected world, the battle for national security extends beyond land, sea, air, and space to encompass a fifth, critical domain: cyberspace. The MoD, custodian of highly sensitive data and advanced technologies, faces a constant barrage of sophisticated cyberattacks. This reality is underscored by the Strategic Defence Review's (SDR) recognition of cyberspace as the enabling domain, integrating all others yet uniquely contested by adversaries daily. These attacks pose significant risks, from the theft of strategic advantage to economic disruption and the erosion of public trust."

We need to be proactive, building security into our capabilities right from the start. That's what Secure by Design does \u2013 it's not just a good idea, it's mission-critical. Think of building a fortress where the strength of each brick, the placement of every wall, is meticulously chosen to provide the optimal level of security. That\u2019s the essence of Secure by Design \u2013 it's about making conscious choices at every stage of development for a more resilient outcome."

Our teams across the organisations, including within delivery, security, and commercials teams are working together, prioritising security from the very beginning of a capability. It's like developing a missile defence system, you wouldn't add the targeting system when missiles are incoming. Cybersecurity is a fundamental component, not an afterthought."

We urge all industry partners to embrace this approach, actively collaborating with MoD delivery teams, consulting the Secure by Design Guidance, and integrating security into their core processes. By working together, we can significantly strengthen our national cyber defences and safeguard the UK's future."
