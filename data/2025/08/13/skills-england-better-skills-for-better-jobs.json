Let me highlight a few areas."

Meanwhile, by 2035 we expect 1.4 million new jobs to be created, with potentially very different skills requirements, driven by technological change.\u00a0"

            "text": "Addressing the reasons behind the decline in employer investment is complex, and multi-faceted but important that we understand much better. For example, as the shortages in the UK economy have grown, the pressure to recruit from abroad has increased, even where there is capacity and capability to train at home. Skills England will work with employers, providers and regions amongst others help understand the reasons for and reverse that trend. We will support employers to equip their domestic workforce with the skills they need for now and in the future. Working alongside the\u00a0Plan for Change\u00a0and\u00a0Industrial Strategy, we will work to unify the currently fragmented skills landscape to help drive economic growth across all regions and access to high quality skilled jobs."

Apprenticeships and technical education have a powerful and well relevant part to play in providing opportunities for school leavers and career changers and existing workers, but their uptake and acceptance needs to be radically improved if we they are going to play the role they could have in the future of our skills system.\u00a0\u00a0"
