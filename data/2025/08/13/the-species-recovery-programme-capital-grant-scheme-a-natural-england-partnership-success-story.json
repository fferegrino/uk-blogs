In 18 months, the Grant Scheme has created and enhanced of over 2,400ha of wildlife-rich habitats including over 260 hectares of flower-rich grassland meadows, 405 hectares of floodplain grasslands and 354 hectares of broadleaved and wet woodland enhanced.

This and a feeling of real engagement with an amazing natural environment has been a huge psychological boost for me, especially after the isolation of COVID and only recently moving to the area. This has been, and continues to be, a great way to gain a better understanding of local ecology and to improve my understanding of the protected areas and species at risk.\u201d"
