The aims is to make these requirements clear and ensure data is more consistent and useable."

            "text": "The team carried out a literature review and examined post-consent monitoring reports from the past 10 years, available through the MMO\u2019s Marine Case Management System, to create an initial list of recommended standards. Following extensive feedback from a stakeholder workshop and an industry survey, the final standards were developed. These recommendations guide applicants to finalising their post-consent monitoring plans for marine mammals, seabirds, benthic habitats, underwater noise, fish and shellfish, and geophysical surveys."

            "text": "The standardised approach will allow data to be compared more easily between projects, which will bring multiple benefits, including making it easier to draw robust conclusions about cumulative impacts and allowing the conclusions from one monitoring programme to be used in assessing the impacts of another project. Over time, this will reduce the uncertainty in assessments by strengthening the feedback loop between data, evidence, and decision-making. This approach will also enable data to be more easily discovered, shared and re-used by stakeholders including industry, SNCBs, regulators and academics, as it will be presented in an accessible and widely understood format."
