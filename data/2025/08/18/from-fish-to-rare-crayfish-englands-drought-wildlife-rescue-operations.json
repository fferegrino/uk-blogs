While Environment Agency fisheries officers work with partners to help fisheries prepare for extreme conditions, teams have needed to step in with emergency rescues as rivers shrink and water temperatures soar. Fish are often the first casualties when conditions deteriorate, but they\u2019re not alone \u2013 birds, insects, and aquatic plants are all struggling as their habitats disappear.\u00a0\u00a0"

By working proactively with fishery operators, many potential rescues have been prevented before they become emergencies.\u00a0"
