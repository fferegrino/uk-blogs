            "text": "Rapid Evidence Assessments (REAs) are a vital part of decision making in government. They help us validate what we already know and what research is missing on a particular topic. However, DBT found that writing REAs is often resource intensive, costly and time-consuming. This causes delays in policy work and can make it harder to respond quickly to new questions."

Our efforts centred on the early research phase, which is typically the most time-consuming and offers the greatest potential for efficiency gains. We developed a prototype application capable of searching vast research databases such as OpenAlex."

            "text": "The app uses advanced technology, including Large Language Models (LLMs) to suggest relevant themes, propose a structure for the REA and recommend which academic papers merit closer attention. Users interact with the system by entering a research question and selecting options like date range or whether they prefer open-access sources. The AI identifies and retrieves the most appropriate academic papers. It then provides users with a downloadable table of links and key details to enable the next steps in evidence assessment."

It refines the results by filtering out any papers that lack an abstract or title and eliminates duplicate entries to streamline the process. Ultimately, it delivers a clear, easy-to-read table that highlights the most relevant research papers for the topic. This entire prototype is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

By combining user-friendly digital tools and artificial intelligence, we are helping policy makers and analysts access the evidence they need faster and more efficiently. This work is paving the way for a smarter, more responsive government and we hope it inspires others to join us on this journey."
