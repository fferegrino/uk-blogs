But behind the scenes, the Environment Agency (EA) is leading a major effort with partners including the local council, businesses and the water company to tackle an issue that has troubled the bay for years: the quality of the bathing water."

But it also shows just how complicated the problem really is."

            "text": "When people hear about poor water quality, many think first of sewage, particularly as there has been a lot of media coverage about this. Storm overflows and wastewater treatment plants do play a part and Yorkshire Water has already spent millions improving local infrastructure and is investing more under its current programme. For example, recent work completed at Wheatcroft Combined Sewer Overflow, to the south of the beach, aims to limit discharges during the bathing season."

In the summer of 2024, the EA coordinated one of the most detailed water quality studies ever carried out in Scarborough, supported financially by all three partners. Samples are now being analysed by EA scientists, with results due shortly which will inform the next steps."

The summer of 2024 already showed signs of improvement, though scientists caution that more monitoring is needed to confirm whether this is a genuine trend. With McCain\u2019s new treatment plant in place, Yorkshire Water\u2019s investment under way, North Yorkshire Council\u2019s renewed commitment, and the EA providing scientific leadership, there is real hope that Scarborough South Bay can turn a corner."
