If you suspect there may be a weed risk, either select a different field or consider strategies for weed control such as the use of stale seedbeds or break crops as outlined below. This increases in importance with extent of soil exposure. For example, ploughing may present more of a weed risk than direct drilling."

However, where moisture allows, June to July is often best as this allows for rapid establishment before the autumn to outcompete weeds and allow grazing before winter. This must be balanced against impacts on forage supply, and it is worth considering strategies to maintain stocks such as the undersowing of wholecrop cereals or use of short-term westerwold leys prior to the herbal ley."
