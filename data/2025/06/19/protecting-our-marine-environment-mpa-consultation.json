These habitats serve as refuges and nursery grounds for many commercially valuable fish species. But the way some fishing practices impact the most sensitive habitats in our waters threatens the rich diversity and future productivity of our seas. "

Conservation objectives have been set for each site based on the current condition of the features within those sites where available, or on a vulnerability assessment of the features. We are required to manage fishing activities so that these conservation objectives can be achieved."

            "text": "Some fishing gears can alter the structure or function of a designated habitat or remove designated species living in those habitats. For example, abrasion from contact of the gear with the seabed, causes channels in the sediment, uprooting species that live there. During Stage 3 we have looked at the impacts of bottom towed gear, traps and bottom set nets and lines on the features of the sites, as these gears all contact the seabed. MMO is required to prevent fishing activities where evidence shows that the negative impacts risk the achievement of the conservation objectives of a site. Management is commonly introduced in the form of a byelaw that prohibits fishing in specified areas.\u00a0"

            "text": "Allowing the continued damage of designated features reduces the amount of suitable habitats available for species to live in or on, or damage to designated species themselves. These species are often prey for other animals, damage therefore reduces food availability, including for those species that are commercially valuable. Damage to habitats and species also reduces the biodiversity of areas, impacting the overall health of these environments. By removing damaging fishing practices, habitats can recover, become more complex, and associated species can increase in abundance and diversity.\u00a0\u00a0"
