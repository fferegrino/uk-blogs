These permits, issued by the Environment Agency, set clear conditions that the wastewater must meet before it can be safely released. These conditions are derived from standards set in environmental legislation such as the Water Framework Regulations and Habitats Regulation. To achieve these standards may require the water company to upgrade or build new infrastructure as well as a consideration of how they manage and operate that infrastructure. It is for the water company to ensure this work is delivered to meet and maintain compliance with their permit requirements.\u00a0\u00a0"

When companies fall short, we use a range of enforcement tools: from advice and guidance, warning letters, civil sanctions to criminal prosecutions. The decision on what enforcement action is taken is guided by the Environment Agency\u2019s Enforcement and Sanctions Policy, which sets out our approach to holding polluters to account. It is vital that we always act within our legal boundaries following due process and applying standards consistently across the water industry. Our decisions must stand up to legal scrutiny, whether challenged in court or assessed through public inquiry.\u00a0"
