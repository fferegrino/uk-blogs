It is estimated that 2 million healthy life years are lost in Europe due to the impacts of poor air quality, making the need to improve air we breathe in and reduce the pollution we produce a clear priority."

It found that actions related to closing streets around schools temporarily (traffic management) can lead to reductions in traffic-pollutant concentrations during certain hours of the day, such as the school drop-off times when children are likely to be exposed to traffic pollution. \u00a0"

The report focuses on the new evidence of the health harms of air pollution that occur even at low air pollution concentrations, linking exposure to air pollution in earlier stages of life to poorer health throughout life."

Building on existing systems will improve public awareness of the major sources of air pollution and their harmful effects, helping to inform actions to reduce personal contribution and exposure. The UKHSA is committed to continuing to work with partners such as Defra and other stakeholders to act on the recommendations set out in this report, ensuring a healthier future for all."
