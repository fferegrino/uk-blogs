The paper explores how climate-smart Marine Spatial Planning (CSMSP) can help us tackle climate change while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources. CSMSP proactively integrates climate considerations into the planning and management of the marine environment, both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve adaptation to a changing climate."

It identifies key blockers and enablers (Figure 1) and highlights real-world examples of where CSMSP is working. The goal is to support countries and planning teams starting to design and deliver more climate-smart marine spatial plans."

Key blockers include limited access to climate data and projections, competing sectoral priorities, and a lack of funding and capacity within planning teams."

England\u2019s marine plans are among those highlighted for incorporating both mitigation and adaptation, with policies that address flooding and coastal erosion, conserving and restoring blue carbon habitats, and strengthening the resilience of developments."

            "text": "As the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) replaces the East Marine Plan, we seek to build on the strong CSMSP foundations already within English marine plans. Insights from this paper will help us go further. By strengthening the use of nature-based solutions and working with researchers and stakeholders to embed climate modelling, evidence, and tools into the planning process, we can make the second generation of marine plans even more climate-smart. In doing so, the English marine plans can help ensure that the ocean continues to protect us as much as we work to protect it."
