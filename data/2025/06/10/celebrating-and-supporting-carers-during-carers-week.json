This highlights the importance of making sure carers feel supported in the workplace. The Civil Service Carer\u2019s Passport enables a carer and their manager to discuss and document the flexibilities to combine caring and work."

The GFIE Carers scheme is open to people returning to work after a period of care, recognising that they may have barriers such as lack of confidence. We provide ongoing assistance and connect these individuals with potential job opportunities they may want to pursue across different Departments."

The Civil Service Carers Network (CSCN) brings together representatives from 42 carers networks across the Civil Service. The CSCN exists to support the networks that provide direct support to carers in Civil Service departments and other public bodies - this is another layer of support for young adult carers and carers coming back to the workplace after a period of care."
