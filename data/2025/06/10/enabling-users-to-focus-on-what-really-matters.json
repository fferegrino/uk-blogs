Harnessing data from the Oracle Database, managed by UKSBS, this tool allows users to create accurate forecasts of payroll and non-payroll expenditure for their cost centres. This enables more detailed budgeting and reporting to take place.\u00a0\u00a0"

This achievement is a direct result of the exemplary collaboration between the Finance and Digital Data and Technology (DDAT) teams, embodying a truly unified approach. Here's how this transformation was accomplished.\u00a0"

Some guiding Agile principles throughout this intensive period were customer collaboration and building working software. These ensured we consistently delivered value at pace by developing the right features and smoothing out any potential bumps along the way."

For many, it meant moving away from the legacy Admin Tool they knew intimately, to rely solely on FFT for their forecasting needs. With Admin Tool being discontinued on FFT\u2019s launch, we needed to get it right first time, and so we gathered crucial feedback throughout the development process. By holding regular demonstrations, we ensured everyone was prepared for the change and had a voice in how the tool was developed."

While the core functionality remains familiar, it's far less clunky and much more intuitive to user's needs. Features like being able to 'find a person's name' makes tasks such as checking vacancies and pay details quicker and easier, avoiding the need to scroll endlessly. Overall, it feels fresh, reliable, modern and well-branded and responsive to what users actually need.\u201d - Sara Bibby, Business Manager (EUS)"

A big focus for us since launch has been hypercare, ensuring that any bugs or issues that arise are swiftly resolved. We're also continuing to evolve the tool beyond its initial Minimal Viable Product (MVP), all while staying true to our Agile principles and building on our strong relationship. The next objectives are to develop a robust multi-year forecasting capability and streamline the process for bringing in new data from Oracle. We will also be working on other improvements across the tool, so reach out to financial.analysis@businessandtrade.gov.uk if you are interested to know more."

Through clear communication and a shared understanding of user needs, we were able to deliver significant time and cost savings. We also reduced tedious processes, enabling users to focus on higher-value work. All of this would not have been possible either, without plenty of feedback from users. By engaging with them throughout the process, we were able to see how different users were interacting with the tool. This significantly helped us to understand what features and functionality were useful or not. However, this was just an MVP. The Financial Forecasting Tool will continue to evolve, with collaboration at its foundation, so watch this space."
