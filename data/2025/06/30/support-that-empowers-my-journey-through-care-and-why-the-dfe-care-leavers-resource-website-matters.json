I\u2019m now proud to be part of the National Children\u2019s Bureau\u2019s Social Care Advisory Board, where I provide lived-experience insight to shape national conversations about children\u2019s social care. I also sit on the Cornwall Community Foundation Grant Panel, which has allowed me to give back to the community while helping shape the kind of change I would have benefitted from growing up."

Staying with them gave me the stability I needed to make that critical transition into adulthood at a manageable pace. But even with that kind of support, the gaps still existed."

It\u2019s a thoughtfully designed space that offers real, usable guidance for young people.It covers vital areas like housing, education, health, money, employment, and entitlements, but in a way that feels clear, supportive, and empowering. It doesn\u2019t assume you already know the system.For young people who may not have a strong support system, having this kind of centralised, easy-to-understand resource could be life changing. Whether you're applying to university, looking for work, sorting benefits, or just trying to figure out how to start living independently, this website gives you a starting point."

I also participated in the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children (APPGC) meeting at Westminster, where we discussed the Children\u2019s Wellbeing and Schools Bill. Young people\u2019s voices shouldn\u2019t just be heard, they should help shape policy."
