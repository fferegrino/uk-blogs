            "text": "For the first nine years of my career, I worked in local government. My first experience conducting research with a disabled user was for a social prescribing service we were designing. This service aimed to support the socially isolated and vulnerable in the borough by connecting them with community networks, groups, and support services through community referrals."

Reaching out to local groups, I connected with a blind resident, let\u2019s call him Clive, who ran a local talking newspaper for other visually impaired residents. He agreed to spend some time with us for user research, so off we went."

            "text": "Firstly, I flicked the light switch on, only to look up and realise there was no bulb in the socket. We were going to do this in the dark. I cringed for not anticipating it. Clive just laughed and sat down on the edge of his sofa. I hadn\u2019t considered that his house would be quite so gloomy. I looked at my colleague for reassurance, couldn\u2019t make out his face, so just sat down next to Clive on the sofa. My colleague looked around for another seat, couldn\u2019t see one, so squeezed up next to me."

        {
            "text": "I started explaining what we wanted to do. I said we wanted to observe him using his usual computer setup while he tried to use our new website. My eyes had adjusted a bit by this point, so I looked around and asked where his computer was. With his foot, he kicked a box next to him on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d he said. I then realised there was no computer screen in sight. We needed to observe where he was on the website throughout the session, in order to take notes and understand where to make changes. My heart sank as I explained the issue to Clive, asking if he would be free again the following week. He laughed again and said, \u201cI thought you might say that.\u201d From beside the sofa, he pulled out a small monitor. \u201cI haven\u2019t needed to use this in years but thought it might be useful,\u201d he explained. A big sigh of relief, again kicking myself for not anticipating it."

        {
            "text": "Firstly, the screen reading software. It was quiet at first, so Clive turned it up so I could hear it. I couldn\u2019t understand a thing. Clive, like many screen reader users, listens at 300%+ speed, which is completely incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Here is a quick video to show what that sounds like. Thankfully, Clive agreed to slow it down to a more manageable 150% speed for the session."
        },
        {
            "text": "Secondly, navigating a web page. There is no scrolling up or down a page for screen reader users. There\u2019s no use of a mouse to click on things. Clive explained that screen reader users typically navigate a page in one of three ways: through lists of links, buttons, or headers. If you go to a webpage and hit TAB on your keyboard a few times, you will see the focus of your navigation dart around the page. This is how users with screen readers consume web content, with each bit of information being read out as a user tabs through."
        },
        {
            "text": "What followed was an incredibly insightful session. There were issues with the navigation on some pages, the context on some links and buttons, and inconsistencies in header layouts. What really stood out to me, though, was the completely different lived experience Clive had. He expressed how happy he was that we were there testing with him, as the Council website was a nightmare for him to navigate, and he struggled to find basic information that he needed. The reason he started the talking newspaper was to help other visually impaired residents get key local information that they would otherwise be unable to get, partly due to poor consideration of accessibility on the Council\u2019s website."

            "text": "Think about a Council laying pavement for a new road. They don\u2019t build the whole pavement, then remove the end blocks so they can drop the kerb and allow wheeled access. Councils understand that a dropped kerb needs to be there at the beginning, and they factor it in from the start, causing no additional cost."

            "text": "It\u2019s a small thing to do, but it has a huge impact on those who need it. Wheelchair users are physically unable to access pavements without a dropped kerb, like how people who use screen readers are unable to navigate or understand web pages if they are not designed properly."
        },
        {
            "text": "Finally, making things accessible doesn\u2019t only benefit those with access needs. If you drop a kerb, it\u2019s not just for people in wheelchairs; it makes it easier to traverse for those with pushchairs or on roller skates. If you create websites that are clearly laid out, in plain English and semantically correct, it doesn\u2019t just help users with screen readers. It makes it easier to understand for those who don\u2019t speak English as a first language, who are neurodiverse, or are trying to get information as quickly as possible."
