The lorries and trucks that supply medicines to hospitals and pharmacies also head to aircrafts, ships, and oil platforms. The supply of medicines to these locations are vital to ensure that planes can fly, ships can sail and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew and passengers, as well as the people that work in these remote locations. The MHRA is committed to supporting stakeholders and to continue to provide guidance."

            "text": "The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 require licence holders and responsible persons to implement robust procedures for establishing the authority and legitimacy of a customer to receive medicinal products. Most organisations are confident with the process to qualify a hospital or pharmacy and establish their authority to purchase medicines, and the MHRA have written blog posts on this topic previously."

            "text": "When the customer becomes something airborne or aquatic, whether it be an aircraft hopping between holiday destinations, a fishing vessel docked in a local harbour, or an oil platform in the North Sea, qualification of bona fides become more complicated. The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 however offers clear information for a company to qualify their customer. Schedule 17, (The Human Medicines Regulations 2012) documents the exemptions from the restrictions on sale and supply of medicinal products. These exemptions are in respect to specific medicines contained within Schedule 17 and does not grant the person exempted free reign of all medicines unless explicitly stated. Whilst using Schedule 17 to qualify a customer it is expected that this is fully documented and described within the Quality Management System. It is expected that an order can be fully traced back to the person placing an order, and it is critical to ensure the person doing so is legitimate and has authority. An example may be the commander of a plane or the master vessel is allowed to purchase medicines, the MHRA Inspectors would require companies to demonstrate that the individual and plane or vessel are validated prior to supply. For ease the company that owns the vessel can place the order of their behalf, however the order placed must be identical to that placed by the commander."

Likewise, organisations operating in the marine sector should familiarise themselves prior to supply as to the legal requirements surrounding both vessels and ports to be supplied prior to despatch (MIN 718 (M+F) The Ship Captain's Medical Guide 24th Edition - GOV.UK) ."

            "text": "Once you have qualified the commander or master and received a matching order, does this mean a smooth journey? Delivering to marine or aviation customers can be a complex task. Chapter 9 of GDP states \u201cDeliveries should be made to the address stated on the delivery note and into the care of the premises of the consignee. Medicinal products should not be left on alternative premises\u201d.\u00a0 Achieving this can be challenging in both aviation and marine scenarios due to restricted access to docks and airports, and the lack of direct access to airside or offshore locations. The MHRA takes a pragmatic approach allowing companies to deliver orders to the goods inwards facility at ports or airports, but companies must ensure that there is clear documentation evidencing that the order has made it to the destination in time. There should also be a \u201cjust in time\u201d mentality. Orders should not be stored for long periods of time in port or airport facilities before being loaded onto the ship or aircraft, as this would require those facilities to be licenced. Organisations undertaking such activity should take reasonable steps to ensure that supplies are compliant with GDP guidance, and consider undertaking, and regularly reviewing, a risk assessment to identify areas of concern prior to supply."

        {
            "text": "Consideration should be paid towards qualifying the airport/port where orders will be received. What are the security measures, hours of operation, and the location of the goods receiving area? Qualifying an aircraft or vessel for one airport or port does not mean the job is complete, as both planes and ships are mobile. You may have qualified the commander or master, delivered to the goods receiving facility, and ensured prompt transfer to the ship or aircraft, but if you plan to supply the same vessel or aircraft at different ports or airports, the process must be repeated for each location."
