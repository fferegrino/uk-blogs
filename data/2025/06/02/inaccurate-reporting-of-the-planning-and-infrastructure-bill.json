This is not being changed through the Planning and Infrastructure Bill."

            "text": "There is a very high bar for exceptions to this rule \u2013 with proposals being wholly exceptional and demonstrating that the public benefit would outweigh the loss or deterioration of habitats, under longstanding safeguards. It must also propose a suitable compensation strategy to enhance the environment."

            "text": "The Ancient Woodland Inventory, updated Planning Practice Guidance, and standing advice from Natural England and the Forestry Commission sets out what constitutes impacts to ancient woodlands and veteran trees and allows local decision makers to make informed decisions about planning applications near these habitats. And last year arrangements were set out for consulting the Secretary of State once planning permission has been granted for development affecting ancient woodland."
