In April 2001, I started as a probation services officer (PSO) at Humberside Probation Service. I began in a spilt role in offender management and as a court officer. I started on the 15-month route for the trainee probation officer programme in November 2021 and qualified last February. Being a 50-something-year-old going through university was initially quite daunting but now I say to people if I did it there\u2019s nothing to stop anybody who\u2019s got something about them being able to do it too.\u00a0\u00a0"

Balancing work, studies, reserves, and family was tough, but the Probation Service made it manageable, and I had support from my university lecturers whenever I needed it.\u00a0"

Going through the military there\u2019s stresses people will experience like separation from families, being on deployments, and being in active environments. I think people who can cope and navigate those stressful environments and help others navigate them too, will be able to use these transferrable skills in the Probation Service. Military personnel are also used to working with people with challenging and complex needs. Senior ranks in the army act as role models and these are skills that we can pass on to offenders. It\u2019s called prosocial modelling and I try and show offenders positive behaviours like being responsible and be more integrated within society.\u00a0"

What I love about probation is the phenomenal support they\u2019ve given me to engage with the army reserve. While I've worked in probation, I've been able to fulfil my responsibilities as a reservist military policeman. I\u2019ve been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Cyprus, and Bosnia. I get additional leave every year as well to meet my commitments with the army reserve and my probation colleagues have always kept in touch with me while I\u2019ve been away, so it feels like I haven\u2019t left when I get back!\u00a0"

Many of the skills force's personnel develop in their military careers are fully transferable into justice roles, and you will be offered the opportunities to further develop these skills. Through the Advance into Justice scheme, applications from veterans or those just about to leave the armed forces are actively encouraged, with either a guaranteed interview for those who are veterans, or the possibility of securing a job before leaving the military. I fully support this scheme and would strongly encourage anyone who is still serving or who has served in the armed forces to consider a position in the Probation Service or other justice organisations.\u00a0"
