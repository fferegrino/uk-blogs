            "text": "We are pleased to announce the publication of the RPC\u2019s new Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) guidance. This document is designed to help policy teams across Whitehall develop more rigorous M&E plans early on in the policy making process. This will in turn improve the quality and effectiveness of their regulations by ensuring they think about the intended impacts and how these will be assessed as they develop proposals."

These examples demonstrate how different approaches and methodologies can be effectively applied to assess policy impacts. They highlight the importance of setting clear objectives, using logical frameworks, and collecting relevant data to evaluate the success of interventions."

            "text": "The new M&E guidance is particularly relevant in light of recent efforts to address the backlog of Post-Implementation Reviews (PIRs) across government departments. As highlighted in our recent blog, evaluating existing regulations is crucial for ensuring they achieve their objectives and do not impose excessive costs. The new guidance will support departments in developing effective M&E plans that can inform PIRs, helping to unlock growth and reduce administrative costs."
