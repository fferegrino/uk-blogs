            "text": "Across the UK, millions of people volunteer. One in four people say they do so at least once a month. That is not a small act. It is a shared effort that helps keep people safe, connected and hopeful."

            "text": "I have met people facing serious challenges \u2014 illness, homelessness, bereavement, poverty \u2014 who still choose to give their time. I have also seen people with wealth, status or significant experience give their time just as freely."
