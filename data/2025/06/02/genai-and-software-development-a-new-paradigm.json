Is artificial intelligence (AI) going to revolutionise software development, fundamentally changing how we write, test and deploy code? I wanted to explore how generative AI (GenAI) can enhance the software development lifecycle. While GenAI presents immense potential for accelerating coding, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency, it also introduces new challenges that must be managed carefully."

This hands-on approach allows us to understand AI-driven development's practical benefits and challenges, ensuring our methodologies remain grounded in real-world applications."

Without careful oversight, we risk deploying hard-to-maintain code that neglects the well-established best practices developed over time to ensure the delivery of quality enterprise software. Without a structured approach, we risk deploying AI-generated code that is inefficient, biased, or misaligned with best practices."

Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on prediction and automation, GenAI can generate code, suggest optimisations and even debug programs. The capabilities of agentic integrated development environments (IDEs) are changing daily, and we are seeing the proliferation of these tools and ideas in supporting platforms. However, adopting GenAI requires a measured approach."
