She devoted herself to caring for my brother David, who has a learning disability, often putting her own health and wellbeing second to her love and commitment. Her experience deeply influenced my decision to pursue a career in social care."

That recognition meant the world to her, and it helped affirm the value of her tireless efforts. Her story inspired me to champion the recognition and support of informal carers during my tenure as ADASS President in 2023."
