My question is: why not design for polity, with \u2018ty\u2019 at the end, as well as design for policy, with \u2018cy\u2019?"

As opposed to the design of specific policies within, and which largely take as given, the existing institutions of democratic government."

It does not have to be whole-system design but can be part-system and single-institution design. Think of reconfiguring government departments in ministerial reshuffles, or the devolution and House of Lords reform proposals in the Gordon Brown-led Commission on the future of the UK, published in 2022, or further plans for Lords reform proposed by the Starmer government. The polity/policy distinction (blurred as it is) does not imply further distinctions (big/small, macro/micro, system/people, or important/less important, for example). The tools in my \u2018democratic design framework\u2019 can be used to think about design of small town council governance, or reconfiguring a government department or agency, as much as restructuring governance at the national level."

            "text": "Policy design involves close and imaginative engagement with ideas of democracy, framed for example in terms of co-production, participatory design or citizen engagement in defining problems and devising solutions. Notable design thinkers and practitioners are more explicit in invoking \u2018democracy\u2019. When they do, arguably they embrace the work of design for polity, as well as for policy. However, they often frame the state or national government as suspicious, remote, perhaps even undemocratic. Design practice embracing local communities is valued, while indirect or representative relations are suspect. The focus is on democracy as local, community based, about ordinary people, working with design professionals, acting together to create new public things and public spaces. Ezio Manzini\u2019s emphasis on democratisation as action in \u2018small local open communities\u2019 is one example; Carl DiSalvo\u2019s similar emphasis on local action is another. In Alistair Fuad-Like\u2019s terms, \u2018taking micro-steps locally with people\u2019 is design\u2019s democratic task."

            "text": "To this trend, I would say\u2026 Yes to democracy as action and engaging ordinary people and their concerns at the scale of the local community. But I question whether that focus should prevent designers paying attention to how democracy is (or could be) structured larger scales such as that of national government. Design thinking about democracy need not be restricted to the local scale."

            "text": "The reasons that design thinking and practice is often highly valued \u2013 openness to people and ideas, participation and shared inquiry, pooling knowledge, imagination, creating innovative solutions - can be elements of polity or government, at large as well as smaller scales. Democracy \u2013 including a democratic polity - can also be a product of design. It is, already, designed, and can be redesigned."

            "text": "So, democracy plus design is not a matter of either-or: either local or nation-state; either process or product. It can be \u2018both-and\u2019: both participative and representative, local and supra-local, process and product. And small scale does not match exclusively with face-to-face participatory design. Designers can work with participatory design at the larger, national scale \u2013 Citizens Assemblies\u2019 crucial role in Ireland\u2019s recent dealing with constitutional issues such as abortion may be an example. That said, design work on institutions or procedures for the democratic polity does not need to be conducted wholly democratically. Designing for democracy (the \u2018product\u2019), and designing democratically (the \u2018process\u2019), are different things that may or may not be pursued together. By the same token, expertise and representation are not anti-democratic and can be compatible with participatory or co-design."
