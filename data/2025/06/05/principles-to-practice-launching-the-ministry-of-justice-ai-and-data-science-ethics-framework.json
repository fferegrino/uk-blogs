We are grateful to the Alan Turing Institute for partnering with us and providing their expertise which has enabled the MoJ to uphold the highest standards of ethical practice in the rapidly evolving field of AI and data science."

I\u2019ve been involved in the development of this framework and building our relationship with the Alan Turing Institute over the last four or five years. I think this gives us a great framework to innovate and push the boundaries of how we can use AI and data science across MoJ while staying ethical, true to our values, and making a positive impact on society."

This included interviews with staff from across the MoJ and close consultation with MoJ management. The results of these engagements, together with desk research and further consultation by Turing researchers, yielded the SUM values and the SAFE-D principles."

The theoretical foundation for this project is a practically-oriented framework of ethical values and principles that grounds the development and use of data science and AI, and supports an end-to-end, procedural approach to the governance of data-driven technologies that aims to promote responsible research and innovation."
