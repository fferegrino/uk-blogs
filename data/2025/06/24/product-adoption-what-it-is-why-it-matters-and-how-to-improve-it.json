Relevant colleagues need to know that this tool exists; how to use it via training and guidance, understand where this information goes and how it\u2019s used. They must also be encouraged to use the tool by their colleagues and senior leaders. Failure to do this might impact our ability to engage with businesses effectively and join the dots internally."

However, there will always be tools that some colleagues are less keen to engage with but are essential to their job. Success relies on buy-in from teams across the organisation. It needs senior leaders to actively encourage buy-in from teams across the department. This will foster the right environment, leading by example and incentivising usage on an ongoing basis. "
