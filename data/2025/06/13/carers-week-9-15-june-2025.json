This is part of our ambition to become the UK\u2019s most inclusive employer, as set out in our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy."

As a carer, I bring empathy to work, alongside an understanding that events and circumstances are not always fixed, and that it\u2019s a good thing to be able to react to that when it happens. I've also learnt a tremendous amount about supporting those with neurodiversity related issues and I share that knowledge with my colleagues enabling all of us to design content that works more effectively for all."

My daughter is now 24 and in supported living. She has two staff 24/7 which certainly made me reflect on how I managed for so long with so little support. I am still a carer and I lead on all professional interactions for her and speak with her staff daily.\u00a0"

Having a Carers Passport has enabled me to openly discuss the real pressures I face and get support from my line manager. I am trusted to work flexibly to manage my caring and feel empowered to request special leave when I need to. As a carer, guilt is a key emotion and the support I have at work enables me to put this to one side and focus on my job. Due to my experiences, I am a master at juggling different aspects of my work, advocating for others and responding swiftly in times of crisis. I bring a high level of resilience and a real understanding of public service and the impact that policies have on the ground. My manager has been pivotal in making me feel valued and this means I believe in my ability and am dedicated to making a difference in the Civil Service."

I am also a carer for my 12 year old son who has complex needs; a severe learning disability rooted in a rare genetic condition and autism, alongside the lifelong effects of early trauma. Like many parent carers it took me a while to realise that I was a carer as well as a parent, handling additional, often unpredictable, practical, emotional and financial worries beyond those usual to parenting."

By using the Carer Passport as a springboard to proactively and regularly discuss working patterns and locations they have made it easier to make flexible working requests and access Special Leave instead of using up holiday days and burning out. With a compressed hybrid work pattern in place to enable me to attend medical appointments and manage changes to support services for my son I can work. In return, my unit continues to benefit from my specialist knowledge developed over a long career."
