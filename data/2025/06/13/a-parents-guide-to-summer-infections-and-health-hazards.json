It commonly affects children aged 1 to 5, causing severe watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever, and loss of appetite for approximately 2 weeks.\u00a0Symptoms often follow a pattern - improving and then feeling worse again before full recovery. Children typically contract cryptosporidiosis from swallowing contaminated water while swimming in pools, lakes or rivers, or through contact with infected faeces, such as on farm visits.\u00a0"

Other green spaces such as urban parks or gardens can also provide opportunities for contact between people and ticks."
