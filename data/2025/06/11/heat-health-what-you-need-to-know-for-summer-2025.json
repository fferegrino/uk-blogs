But how exactly does heat impact the body, and what can we do to avoid the negative effects?"

This is done by comparing the number of deaths during heatwaves with the number that occurred on other summertime days. While summer 2024 was one of the coolest in recent years, our latest annual heat mortality report gives important insights into how even moderately high temperatures can influence mortality during summer."

            "text": "Other factors that may influence the number of heat-related deaths include public awareness and how people respond during hot weather, as well as conditions like warm nights, which can make it harder for the body to cool down and recover, intensifying the impact of a heatwave."

For the first time, the number of deaths has been calculated for different settings, such as in the home, in care homes and hospitals. There are also new splits for local areas and for different underlying causes of death. This allows us to gain a clearer picture of the impacts of heat on health across the population."

            "text": "The 2023 and 2024 heat mortality reports both highlight that significant heat-associated deaths occurred during yellow alert periods. This shows that action is needed across all alert levels, not just during extreme heat events. Heat doesn\u2019t have to be record-breaking to be dangerous for some."
