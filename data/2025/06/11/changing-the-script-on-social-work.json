Now, I'm Head of Service for Contextual Safeguarding at Birmingham Children's Trust. This involves leading a multi-agency partnership hub to protect children from exploitation, those reported missing, involved in serious violence, or vulnerable to radicalisation. I'm also a foster carer and proud Birmingham City University alumna, recognised with the High Sheriff award for community work.\u00a0"

In an unsafe home environment with mental health issues and neglect, I was frequently reported missing, sometimes for weeks at a time. At 14, I was permanently excluded from school, and by 15, placed in local authority care after being declared \"beyond parental control.\"\u00a0\u00a0"
