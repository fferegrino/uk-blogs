Like many chalk streams, the Mimram is under pressure from low flows, pollution, and habitat degradation. These globally rare habitats are a special type of spring-fed river unique to England and north-west Europe."

That\u2019s really important because specific local issues, for example, the demand for water, pollution or invasive species, may start in the wider catchment and those that affect or who are affected by them should be empowered to find the solutions. We recognise that for a number of years, different groups and stakeholders have been coming together to improve the Mimram, so now the aim is to consolidate on this good work and hopefully make further progress."

            "text": "\u201cIn these first few months, I have been meeting with and listening to landholders to understand the support that they would like and gathering existing data on the catchment. Already, 11 of those, with land right next to the Mimram, have said that they would like to work towards improving the river, which is hugely encouraging. Over the coming months and years, we\u2019ll work together to create and deliver restoration and management plans that address some of the reasons why the river is not achieving good ecological status, according to the Water Framework Directive. \u00a0"

I am also working with the Mimram Farm Cluster, signposting funding opportunities and supporting individuals with the actions they want to take and acquiring funding for it."

            "text": "\u201cWithin the wider catchment, there are 191 Local Wildlife Sites\u2014areas of land recognised for their high value to nature in the Hertfordshire area. These sites create important links across the landscape and offer opportunities to hold water in the environment. Most are privately owned, and I\u2019ll be supporting landholders with sites that rely on water to help keep their plant and animal communities healthy. This is especially important in a chalk catchment, where holding more water in the landscape helps recharge the groundwater and makes the area more resilient during dry periods."

Across the wider catchment, we are aiming to increase the numbers of declining bird species such as yellowhammers, lapwings and corn buntings \u2013 all priorities in the emerging Hertfordshire Nature Recovery Strategy.\u201d."

Despite their importance nationally and internationally, only 17 per cent met good ecological status under the Water Framework Directive in 2019. The River Mimram is one of the many chalk streams currently falling short of this standard."

Heidi is bringing together farmers, landowners, and local communities to drive action forward for the benefit of people and wildlife. By improving water resources, habitat, and the river\u2019s resilience during periods of high and low flow, this project is helping to secure a healthier future for the River Mimram, and the communities that value it."
