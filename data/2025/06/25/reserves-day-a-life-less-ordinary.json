For me, Reserves Day during Armed Forces Week is a chance to reflect on how these two roles complement each other and the value that reservists bring to defence.\u00a0"

As an MOD Civil Servant, it's vital that I maintain a broad understanding of Defence. My Reserve service allows me to do this from the perspective of the very people my Civil Service role supports daily.\u00a0"

At the most basic level, the Reserve Army adds mass to the Regular Army \u2013 turning what I like to call a \"triathlete\" into a \"power lifter that can run.\" But perhaps more importantly, reservists bring unique knowledge, skills and experience from their civilian careers that add tremendous value to Defence capabilities. In my own Battery, I command soldiers who work in the civilian drone industry, bringing expertise that has clear utility for military operations.\u00a0"
