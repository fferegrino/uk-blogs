The West Country Odyssey is part of work commissioned through the Protected Site Strategies research programme with the RENEW programme led by University of Exeter and the National Trust. The purpose, to showcase nature and the importance of nature recovery alongside partnership working and the power of film in communicating and engaging when working collaboratively."

The main purpose and rationale for Protected Site Strategies (PSS) (enshrined in the Environment Act legislation that provides us with new power to work collaboratively) is to find solutions to environmental issues that cannot be resolved well at the site level. Often, their root causes are part of a wider malaise, whether it be from diffuse pollution of air or water, overgrazing from overpopulations of herbivores, or a result of disconnection of people from the many benefits nature brings."

            "text": "All this alongside helping to build food systems that help re-vitalise the fortunes of our very best biodiversity and geodiversity. But, by joining with a diversity of partners to resolve these conundrums, we have begun to demonstrate the full potential of PSS to tackle a variety of environmental ills in different contexts. What we have learned is core to our Strategy Direction ambitions, both ways of working and our priorities, and will be central to the delivery of our future Strategy outcomes. Details are provided in the sections of our first version of Protected Site Strategies Advisory Guidance. "

We are also starting to attract additional investments through Protected Site Strategies from both public and private investors, and we plan to accelerate roll out of in subsequent years."
