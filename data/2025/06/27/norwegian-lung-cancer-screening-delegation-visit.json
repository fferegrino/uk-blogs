It\u2019s now called the NHS Lung Cancer Screening Programme, and the aim is simple: catch lung cancer early, ideally before symptoms appear, and when treatment stands a better chance of working.\u00a0"

It offers them a risk assessment based on their smoking history and some other factors. Those in the higher-risk group get invited for a specialist scan. If there is a suspicious finding, they will be offered an urgent clinic visit. If there are findings that might be early cancer, then scans are done after 3 and 12 months. Other participants have their next scan after 2 years. \u00a0"
