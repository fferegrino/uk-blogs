This means that woodland creation rates over the past year were 27% higher than in 2023/24, and 156% higher than in 2021/22 (when the Tree Planting Programme was in its infancy). In addition, 888,000 trees were planted outside woodland. This is the equivalent to 1,399 hectares, bringing the total area of tree canopy established and numbers of trees planted to 7,164 hectares, or 10.4 million trees. An equivalent to 10,000 football pitches."

We\u2019re making a meaningful difference: reconnecting people with nature, restoring our landscapes, and putting down the roots for a greener, more resilient future. Trees are at the heart of our mission to support biodiversity, combat climate change and create thousands of green jobs across the country."

The Western Forest will see 20 million trees planted across the West of England, bringing nature closer to where people live and work. It\u2019s a landmark moment and one that signals this government\u2019s long-term commitment to transforming our environment."

The settlement included the largest investment in nature in our history: over \u00a37 billion committed to nature\u2019s recovery. That includes \u00a3816 million for tree planting and \u00a385 million for peatland restoration over the Spending Review period."

It means that millions more trees can be planted across the country to help cool our cities, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and quantity, and capture carbon. Not only that, but this funding will also help to support our mental and physical health, as trees improve the air that we breathe, encourage exercise, and improve our mental wellbeing. The presence of trees leads to healthier, happier communities."

Using timber in buildings not only locks away carbon for the long term, but also replaces more carbon-intensive materials like concrete and steel, helping to reduce overall emissions. The UK is currently the second-largest importer of timber globally, but through our Timber in Construction Roadmap, we\u2019re strengthening the domestic timber industry and supporting sustainable construction with British-grown wood."

Our goal to increase woodland cover to 16.5% of England\u2019s land area by 2050 is ambitious, but with continued investment, innovation, and collaboration to draw on all our collective passion and expertise, we can make it a reality."
