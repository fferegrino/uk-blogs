Take extra care with children and don\u2019t rely on sunscreen alone to protect yourself from the sun. Wear suitable clothing and spend time in the shade when the sun's at its hottest\u00a0between 11am to3pm. UV can damage the eyes too, so wearing wraparound sunglasses with UV protection - not all sunglasses have this - and a wide brimmed hat can help minimise your eyes\u2019 exposure to UV."

There are questions as to whether you are more likely to develop cancer due to your individual genetics, but it\u2019s generally considered that those who repeatedly over-expose themselves to high levels of UV, from the sun, sunbeds or lamps, run the highest risk of developing\u00a0skin cancer. Some countries have banned sunbeds and others, such as the UK, have passed laws to restrict who can use them. Over exposure to UV, from the sun or sunbeds, can also lead to\u00a0cataracts."

But occasionally we get higher UV levels\u00a0early in the year\u00a0in the UK. We burn more easily as the seasons start to change because from autumn until spring we spend more time indoors and the UV from the sun is generally weaker. A burst of UV early in the season, or perhaps in the winter, will cause us to burn more easily."
