Coats and jackets are locked away, half-empty half-forgotten tubes of sun cream emerge from deep cupboards, radiators are joyfully turned off."

Our recent\u00a0AI\u00a0Airlock webinar and this week\u2019s opening of our new\u00a0call for applications\u00a0boldly announces a new year of inspiration, exploration and progress in innovative regulation. Building on the successes of last year\u2019s excellent pilot programme, we\u2019re eager to unlock and expand insights with industry and see first hand how innovative products and teams can help identify regulatory challenges in the Software as Medical Devices space."

The direct engagement the\u00a0MHRA\u00a0has with members of the\u00a0AI\u00a0Airlock allows the findings to inform our foundational thinking for the regulation of Software and\u00a0AI\u00a0Medical Devices. The information and detail delivered by RADIANT is downstream of this \u2013 augmenting what tools, educational material and guidance is provided to help innovators navigate the broader regulatory landscape."

With a clear path to sustainability and deliverables already being met, both CERSIs continue to improve and inform this rapidly developing space."

Rather, innovation, driven by competition, delivers better products which make patients safer. Demands for patient safety, through clear documentation and proportionate regulation that provides a level playing field and secure, protective framework, create a more transparent market ensuring innovative products excel."

This week we were proud to announce that we became the first country in the world to join\u00a0Health\u00a0AI\u2019s new global network of health regulators\u00a0focussed on the safe and effective use of\u00a0AI\u00a0in healthcare. As a founding pioneer nation, we will work with regulators around the world to share early warnings on safety, monitor how\u00a0AI\u00a0tools perform in practice, and shape international standards together \u2013 helping make\u00a0AI\u00a0in healthcare safer and more effective for patients around the world."

As we progress and deliver key, actionable insights through our specific guidance, we continue our engagement with experts to direct and augment our publications. If you\u2019re attending the Royal College of Psychiatrists International Conference in Newport this week, you\u2019ll see\u00a0MHRA\u00a0representatives there, eager to hear how we can enhance our work to deliver useful insights in this essential HealthTech space."

By transparently outlining our logic, we hope that industry, users and other regulators will be reassured of our alignment with international principles in this emergent space and get insights into our thinking and processes. As we refine this piece of keystone guidance, we also continue to progress our CyberSecurity and\u00a0AI\u00a0development and deployment guidance and we look forward to publishing that soon."

Revolutionary technologies like\u00a0HistoSonics\u2019 ultrasound device, which breaks up tumours without surgery or radiation, is the sort of thing once considered science fiction. Yet, thanks to the excellent work of IDAP partners and\u00a0MHRA\u00a0colleagues, patients now have access to a game changing treatment for liver cancer \u2013 an example of smart, agile regulation in action."

The opportunity to exchange ideas, debate economics and regulations, and get hands-on experiences with new developments is a real privilege. Presenting our regulatory strategy alongside leaders like David Lawson from the Department of Health and Social Care and Richard Phillips from the Association of British HealthTech Industries at Australia House was an opportunity only surpassed by a chance to see the Lord Mayor of the City of London in the flesh - bedecked with full ceremonial chain and garb!"
