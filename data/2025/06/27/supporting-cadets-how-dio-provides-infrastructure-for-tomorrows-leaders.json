In several areas of the country, the only people in uniform that members of the public might see are Army Cadets. Although the Army Cadets aren't primarily a recruiting tool for the armed forces, many cadets do express interest in military careers. Those who join the armed forces often progress to become officers and senior non-commissioned officers. The Army Cadets support young people in pursuing any career path they choose, whether military or civilian.\u00a0"

This prestigious event attracts 2,400 teenagers who navigate routes of 35, 45 and 55 miles across Dartmoor in under two days, carrying all they need to complete their journey and camp overnight. Additionally, 400 young people with physical, neurological or educational challenges participate in the Jubilee Challenge, a one-day event. The significance of Ten Tors was highlighted this year when General Walker, Chief of the General Staff, attended as Guest of Honour.\u00a0"

Their preparation requires extensive training on Dartmoor, led by qualified Cadet Force Adult Instructors who dedicate considerable time to developing these young people. DIO plays a crucial supporting role by providing expert advice on optimal use of the training estate, offering accommodation and feeding facilities before teams venture onto the moor, sharing subject matter expertise on Dartmoor's terrain and conditions, creating safe training environments for participants and the public, and delivering regular updates on ground conditions across the moor.\u00a0"
