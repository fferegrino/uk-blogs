The rate of applications has been growing steadily \u2013 the number of applications we received in the past year is nearly double the number for the previous year. So although we\u2019re registering more homes, we\u2019re not keeping pace with the increase in applications."

We\u2019ve been continuing to receive new applications at the rate of approximately 30 each month, and sometimes even more than this. We have now registered over 1,000 supported accommodation providers, but approximately 500 are still waiting for a decision on their application."

            "text": "One consequence of this volume of applications is the concern that the \u2018market\u2019 is becoming even more saturated in some regions: that there is more provision becoming available than is needed. Crucially, proposed provision is not always of the right type or in the right location to meet local need. This results in too many children living far from home and in situations that don\u2019t necessarily provide the type of care they need."

            "text": "Similarly, we\u2019ve seen how the best commissioners continue to work with local providers to make sure that children are getting the quality care and support that they deserve and that the services can adapt to changing needs. That\u2019s been very impressive but those types of relationships between commissioners and providers have not always been evident."

We want to focus on those where there is a clear need for provision and the application shows that they will be able to meet that need. This will ensure that we use our resources wisely in the best interests of children."

Unfortunately, the exceptionally high volume of new registration applications, particularly in children\u2019s homes and supported accommodation (residential family centres are also increasing significantly), means that it is likely to take several months to reach a decision on new applications, far beyond our usual timescales."
