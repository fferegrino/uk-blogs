The state of digital government review notes that the UK public sector currently spends more than \u00a31 billion each year on cloud solutions, and this figure is only expected to increase as more organisations embrace this technology."

The blueprint sets out improvements to spending on digital services and the procurement of third-party services, of which cloud services currently make up a large proportion.\u00a0"

This is so that future cloud services will be able to be procured and provisioned in the most cost efficient manner. This can only be achieved by creating a baseline against which these services are measured.\u00a0"

GDS is now part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), so it has a whole public sector remit. For the purposes of this activity, we used the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) Public sector or private sector: How the ONS decides \u2013 and why it matters. The public sector classification guide and forward work plan was our baseline scope."

While we didn\u2019t manage to achieve this, if we hadn't set that ambitious objective, we almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have such a strong backlog of interested organisations. It\u2019s also worth noting that our code-based deployment system has proven much more successful than expected as, in a few cases, onboarding took less than 15 minutes."

While there is a lot of work to do to get to full coverage, we\u2019re actively working to increase our number of participating organisations and are eager to get as many others as possible involved to help build this solution. If your organisation has not yet engaged, you can reach out to us at cloud-strategy@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.\u00a0We have also recently launched the government FinOps community, which can be found on the #finops Slack channel. The aim of this group is to bring together individuals from across the public sector who are responsible for or involved with FinOps practices, and new members are welcome to join."
