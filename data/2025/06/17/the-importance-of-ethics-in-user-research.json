But to do this safely, we need everyone involved in research to understand and apply ethical principles. Our user researchers are supporting colleagues to do this, and we\u2019ll be sharing more in future blogs about what this looks like in practice."

Research ethics is not simply a bureaucratic checklist or a form that helps institutions avoid legal issues, but a baseline for conducting research involving people.
