            "text": "We learned that you can\u2019t simply deliver hardware or switch systems and expect instant adoption. You have to bring people with you \u2013 explaining the why, listening to their concerns, and showing them the value, explaining the benefits and what\u2019s in it for them."

When delivering change that affects thousands of people and dozens of stakeholder groups, the process is rarely linear."
