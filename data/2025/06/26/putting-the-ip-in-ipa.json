As a beer lover, I was recently enjoying a pale ale when I started to consider the intellectual property (IP) that is in each sip. From ancient origins to modern craft creations, beer has been a British staple for thousands of years, and continues to bubble with innovation, creativity and protected ideas in the 21st century."

In 1876, Bass Brewery secured trade mark\u00a0UK00000000001 for their original beer label featuring a red tringle, making history as the UK's first registered trade mark. The iconic beer even appeared in an early example of product placement with its recognisable branding featured prominently in Manet's \"A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re.\" This pioneering mark still protects the symbol that adorns Bass beer bottles today, demonstrating the enduring power of trade mark protection."

            "text": "However, its not just their longevity that makes a trade marks a valuable asset for businesses - they\u2019re essential tools that protect a brand\u2019s identity. Global brands and household names continue to update their trade mark portfolio, with beer labels old and new, logos, and brand names all often having registered trade marks. Peroni exemplifies this approach with trade marks such as\u00a0UK00003133737, safeguarding the distinctive identity of this Italian beer brand."

Beer company Beavertown maintain a well-stocked trade mark portfolio that protects all aspects of their brand. Whether it's the words alone (UK00004072309), stylised words (UK00004072305), a logo (UK00004072301), or a combination of those things, they understand that distinctive visual identities deserve protection.

GB2629346, a \"method and apparatus for treatment of conduits and the like,\" reduces the risk of beer spoiling during the transport from brewery to bar. Even major established brands continue to innovate as evidenced by Coors Brewing Co's 2022 application, GB2624598A, for a system maintaining carbonation levels in beverages."
