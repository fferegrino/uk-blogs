The OCPP delivers work under three thematic areas: biodiversity, marine pollution, and sustainable seafood. Funding is provided through the Official Development Assistance (ODA) overarching Blue Planet Fund (BPF) by the\u00a0UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)\u00a0and delivered collaboratively by the\u00a0Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas),\u00a0Marine Management Organisation (MMO)\u00a0and\u00a0Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)."

From May to November each year, an upwelling of nutrient-rich waters\u2014linked to the South West Monsoon\u2014drives a plankton bloom that attracts hundreds of reef mantas and occasional whale sharks to the bay for feeding."
