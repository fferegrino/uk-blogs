            "text": "Seabound began in 2021, started by Roujia and her co-founder Alisha Fredriksson. The pair met while studying at Minerva University. The concept for Seabound emerged from Alisha's experience working at a maritime e-fuel startup, which produced methanol for ships as an alternative energy source. Ironically the team couldn't get enough carbon dioxide to make the synthetic fuel in the first place, which sparked the innovative idea of capturing carbon dioxide directly from ships and feeding it back into the production process. This is done by calcium looping \u2013 a method that takes calcium-based materials to bind the carbon dioxide so that it can be safely transported back to shore. This pure carbon dioxide can then be sold on to companies making chemicals or e-fuels. \u00a0\u00a0"
