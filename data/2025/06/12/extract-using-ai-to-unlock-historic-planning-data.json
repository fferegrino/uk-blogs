The model reads the document, understands the context, finds the information, and structures it into Digital Planning's modern data format that a modern computer system can instantly use.

Standard LLMs are masters of language and words, but they can't natively 'read' a map and produce precise shapes of boundary areas. This is where the novel part of our method comes in. We built a multi-stage pipeline that chains together several specialised AI models \u2013 combining VLMs with tools like OpenCV and SAM, to trace boundaries drawn on maps. These are tools that act like highly precise digital scalpels. They can meticulously trace the boundary, creating a clean digital outline known as a polygon.\u00a0"
