These efforts include funding to create a mosaic habitat, with over 100 volunteers taking part in tree and seed planning, as well as Sustainable Drainage Systems funding to support nature-based solutions that improve soil health and river conditions. The partnership also worked on defining a route though Hartlepool for the King Charles III England Coast Path. It was great to hear about the positive progress being made in our region."
