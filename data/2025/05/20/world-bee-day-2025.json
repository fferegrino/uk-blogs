            "text": "Pollinators support our wider ecosystem by pollinating trees and flowers, which in turn support insects, birds, and mammals by providing food, shelter, and other resources. Pollinators are also particularly important when it comes to food production. The economic contribution of wild bees (which pollinate between 85%-95% of the UK\u2019s insect pollinated crops), have been assessed to be worth about \u00a31,800 per hectare.\u00a0 That adds over half a billion pounds a year to the value of UK crops and food production.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The aim of the week is to raise awareness of the importance of pollinators and share ideas, actions, and activities that highlight the ways everyone can help bees and other pollinators thrive. This year, Bees\u2019 Needs Week is taking place between 14-20 July, and several events are being held across the country with activities such as Flower-Insect Timed Counts (FIT Counts), a live bumble beehive to observe, informative talks, and rare bee surveys.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Flower Insect Timed (FIT) Counts can be done anywhere, including gardens and parks, in warm, dry weather and at any time from April to September. Every count submitted to the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme (PoMS) helps us learn more about where pollinators live and how their numbers are changing. Read the PoMS instructions for FIT Counts to find out more and help us help pollinators!\u00a0\u00a0"
