Developed under the Sunrise Partnership between the UK Space Agency, the European Space Agency (ESA), and Eutelsat Group, and built by UK-based Satixfy and MDA it features a fully digital, software-defined payload capable of beam-hopping and regenerative processing. This means it can steer, and switch communication beams up to 1,000 times per second\u2014dynamically adjusting coverage and power to meet real-time demand."

It\u2019s also a key demonstrator for integrating satellite communications with terrestrial 5G networks, helping to bridge the digital divide in underserved and remote regions. With its scheduled testing now successfully completed, JoeySat is ready to enhance space environment characterisation\u2014such as radiation monitoring\u2014supporting the operational safety of the Eutelsat OneWeb LEO constellation."

Using a lean engineering approach and commercial off-the-shelf components, the satellite went from contract signing to launch in under 2 years, despite major impacts such as the COVID pandemic\u2014demonstrating the UK\u2019s ability to deliver complex space missions quickly and efficiently. The payload was fully tested and integrated in the UK, showcasing national capabilities in sustainable satellite manufacturing and advanced testing infrastructure."
