Getting there will present huge challenges, but it will also offer big opportunities especially for new, innovative businesses."

The timber industry uses a grading classification where \u2018C\u2019 stands for \u2018coniferous\u2019 followed by a number which refers to the bending strength in Newton meters. C16 is suitable for most general construction applications, including structural framing or cut sections for roof trusses, whereas C24 is used for roles requiring more strength/load bearing i.e. longer spans.

What would make much more sense for the climate would be insulation made from wood fibre, as it can both store carbon and has a lower level of embodied carbon i.e., uses less fossil fuels."
