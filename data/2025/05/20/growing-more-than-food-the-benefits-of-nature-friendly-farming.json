            "text": "Across the country, farmers are grappling with increasingly unpredictable and volatile weather, which makes it difficult to plan, grow crops or raise livestock. At the same time, many are keenly aware that their land has become less rich in nature than it once was. There are fewer insects in the soil, fewer birds in the air, and fewer natural features that once helped farms prosper."

            "text": "This shift in farming practices wasn\u2019t a choice, but the result of years of advice that focused solely on maximising yields. For decades, farmers were told to prioritise output and rely on chemicals, while nature was seen as an obstacle. Hedgerows were grubbed out, trees felled and wetlands drained to make way for larger fields and more intensive production and practices. But this approach has come at a steep environmental cost, and continuing down this path puts the future of farming at risk. To protect both the land and the livelihoods of farmers, we urgently need a shift to nature-centered farming methods."

            "text": "This means recognising that conventional, intensive farming systems not only harm the environment, but also jeopardise the long-term viability of farm businesses. Over-reliance on artificial inputs degrades soil and pollutes water and air, weakening the land\u2019s resilience and its ability to store water - exactly what farmers need to protect their crops and livelihoods during both heavy rains and dry spells."

While others around us are really struggling with the dry spring and failing crops, ours are still holding up well. You just don\u2019t know what the weather will throw at you year to year. That\u2019s why building resilience into the farming system is absolutely essential.\u201d"

Trees and shrubs with medicinal properties can also reduce the need for wormers, benefitting both livestock and soil health by supporting dung beetles. An example of this approach is Jack Cockburn's, farm in Ceredigion, West Wales."

            "text": "Upland farms can play a vital role in holding water by helping to protect communities downstream from flooding, while still providing grazing land for pasture-fed animals and supporting species-rich habitats. Techniques like re-meandering streams and installing leaky dams slow the flow of water, reducing the impact of storms and violent deluges that are becoming increasingly common. These natural approaches not only mitigate flood risk but also enhance biodiversity and soil health. Renewable energy, such as solar panels, can significantly reduce farm bills while contributing to wider emissions reduction efforts. "

Niche grains, legumes, herbal leys and heritage varieties all offer opportunities to tap into changing consumer tastes. Adding value through on-farm processing or direct sales, and exploring potential premiums for sustainable or local produce, can further strengthen farm income. An example of this approach is Debbie Wilkins\u2019 work at her family farm in Gloucestershire."
