Ranging from the \u2018man with a van\u2019 collecting rubbish for cash and then illegally dumping it - through to large scale and organised criminal networks, collecting rubbish on an industrial scale and illegally disposing of it \u2013 it\u2019s a colossal problem. Waste crime is costing the economy in England an estimated \u00a31 billion every year. The waste industry estimates 18% of all waste is estimated to be illegally handled \u2013 that\u2019s 34 million tonnes, enough to fill 4 million skips."

Private landowners face huge bills to clear illegally dumped waste from their land and premises. The environment suffers from the pollution dumped waste can cause, impacting people and wildlife."
