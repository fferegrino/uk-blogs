They spent the day shadowing the veterinary nursing team, chatting to the practice leadership, and hearing from the whole veterinary team about the wonderful work RVNs get involved in.\u00a0"

Some RVNs enjoyed the variety of being a generalist, and sharing their time between consult rooms, theatres, and wards. There were others who had a clear interest in one area and were encouraged to spent time in that area and specialise their skills. There were also lead nurses for surgery and wards, demonstrating the progression that can be available.\u00a0"
