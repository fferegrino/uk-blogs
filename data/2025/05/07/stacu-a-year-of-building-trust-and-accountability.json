            "text": "When I was tasked by the Home Secretary with overseeing StaCU's creation in September 2023, it was in response to the Independent Review of Prevent (IRP) recommendation that robust oversight for the Prevent programme was vital. The IRP had concerns over scrutiny and accountability. StaCU was conceived as the answer to these concerns."

            "text": "This issue was covered in the IRP, which concluded that Islamism was \u201ca neutral descriptor\u201d that is \u201cessential within Prevent\u201d and not using the term \"would deny government the ability to name the problem and therefore deliver effective policy.\u201d \u00a0"
