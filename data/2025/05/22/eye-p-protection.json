Ayscough worked as an optician's apprentice while simultaneously establishing his shop in London. Though primarily known for his microscopes, Ayscough introduced spectacles with revolutionary double-hinged side pieces in c.1752 \u2013 the start of what we know today as sunglasses.\u00a0"

While these early tinted lenses weren't yet the UV protective accessories we treasure today, they represented an important step in the evolution of protective eyewear.\u00a0"

            "text": "It was another British pioneer, Sir David Brewster, who made a discovery in c.1815 that would transform sunglasses. While studying polarised light, Brewster determined the precise angle at which light on a reflective surface could be transmitted. This was previously known as plane-polarised but is now referred to as \"Brewster's Angle.\" This scientific principle underpins the polarised sunglasses that protect our eyes from glare today.\u00a0"
