            "text": "On 26 March 2024, the Home Office issued a press release which contained false and defamatory allegations concerning FP McCann Limited. The press release stated that FP McCann Limited had been fined up to \u00a3225,000 in civil penalties for illegally employing five contractors at a mill in North Wales. This allegation was erroneous and false. The Home Office accepts that FP McCann\u2019s contractors were lawfully entitled to work the site in North Wales. FP McCann has therefore not been fined by the Home Office. The Home Office apologises to FP McCann Limited and its directors for publishing the false and defamatory allegations, and has agreed to pay it substantial damages, and its reasonable legal costs, as a result of the publication of the erroneous press release."
