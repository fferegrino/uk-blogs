Our next step is to go even further and create a brand new council that will directly steer decision making, with our recent HoE workshop helping to form the council\u2019s structure and purpose."

            "text": "We\u2019ve made some fantastic progress in key areas, such as supporting career progression for engineers by identifying and planning pathways for specific engineering roles. Our group has proven to be an integral part of the overall community by turning their needs into real, tangible requirements, and the purpose of the new Engineering Excellence council will be to make sure that those requirements are met.\u00a0"

            "text": "The reason that the new Engineering Excellence council is so important is that earlier in the year, the state of digital government review highlighted several critical issues within the digital supply chain. One of these was that senior leaders can lack the technical knowledge required to deliver effective digital services. This also ties in closely to the larger concern around siloed working hindering knowledge from being shared across teams, programmes, and even directorates."

            "text": "The blueprint also focuses on elevating leadership, which means investing in the right people with the right expertise. In the case of software engineering, there is no better way to do this than by creating a leadership group from our existing community of practitioners.\u00a0"

            "text": "While it might still be at an early stage, this council will play an important role in bridging the gap between those who work in the engineering space and senior decision makers. As the council\u2019s name suggests, its priority will be to establish and maintain excellence; it will bring the voice of engineering into strategy building."

It was insightful to find areas that lots of members aligned on, as well as areas where they either disagreed on the point itself or its priority. It has given us a community-driven list of topics to explore over the coming year.\u201d"
