The UK led the European consortium that designed and built the MIRI instrument for JWST\u2014 one of four instruments on board, and that leadership delivered long-term benefits for the UK, winning more observing time than any country aside from the US in NASA\u2019s first competition. The UK Space Agency hopes to replicate this model on HWO.\u00a0"
