These can include increasing root development to encourage uptake of more water and reducing water loss from leaves during the hottest periods. Early signs include wilting of leaves/needles, and in these initial stages trees are usually able to recover from these conditions."

In young trees it is likely that extended periods of exposure to drought will result in tree death."
