The validity of GMP and GDP certificates has subsequently been extended annually via a statement on our database with the last extension having ended December 2024[2]."

Since December 2024, we have been providing a reactive service to holders of UK manufacturing authorisations contacting us because they need an updated GMP certificate to continue trading. In January 2025, this was extended to 3rd country manufacturing sites under MHRA oversight for GMP compliance.\u00a0 Once the required information has been received, we aim to conclude the assessment within 28 working days."
