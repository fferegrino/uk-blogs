It also offers a way of addressing a wide range of other pressing issues \u2013 from supporting children\u2019s early years development to helping people retrain for jobs in the green economy. This work is urgent and essential. But for a long time, budgets and capacity have been in sharp decline, and professionals have had little support to learn from peers and share good practice."
