            "text": "In the UK, the breast screening programme invites women every 3 years from the age of 50 to their 71st birthday. The digital mammography screening test takes pictures of each breast from 2 angles. Screening helps catch breast cancer, reducing the chance of death from the condition by 20%. However, screening can miss some cancers, particularly in women who have dense breast tissue. About 10% of women have very dense breasts and up to 50% have some mixed dense and fatty tissue. Very dense breast tissue shows up on mammograms as white or opaque, making tumours harder to detect."

        {
            "text": "In 2019, the UK NSC looked at the evidence for whether offering extra ultrasound screenings after a standard mammogram test could help women with dense breasts. The goal was to evaluate the benefits and harms of measuring breast density during mammograms and of providing additional ultrasound screening tests for those with dense breasts."
        },
        {
            "text": "This review found a strong link between higher breast density and an increased risk of breast cancer, as well as a reduction in the effectiveness of mammograms when breast density is high."

            "text": "It also investigated how accurately ultrasounds after mammography could detect cancer in women with dense breasts compared to mammography alone. The review concluded that the use of ultrasound could not yet be recommended. This was for 2 reasons. Firstly, there was no standard test for dense breasts, so the same woman might get different results from different tests.\u00a0Secondly, ultrasound can lead to many false positive test results that incorrectly indicate the presence of cancer. It can find some cancers that mammograms miss, but there was no clear evidence that it lowered the chances of dying from breast cancer."

        {
            "text": "The review concluded there was not enough evidence to support a change to the screening programme. Based on these findings, the Committee decided not to recommend extra ultrasound screenings after negative mammograms for women with dense breasts."
