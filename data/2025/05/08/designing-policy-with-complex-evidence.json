            "text": "These challenges present risks for policy teams. Without a holistic view of the evidence, we can introduce assumptions and bias. For complex policy areas, a lack of methods to collectively make sense of complexity in the evidence base, can lead to siloed policy ideas and interventions which don\u2019t make sense in delivery, for end users or frontline workers."

This also risks undermining trust in government if citizens are engaged in research on the same issues multiple times."

We\u2019ll explain the first two stages of this methodology below which cover the evidence gathering activities. In the next blog we\u2019ll explain the evidence mapping workshop itself."

They argue that insight \u2018nuggets\u2019 (rather than research reports) are the most useful, actionable unit of research. And they\u2019ve shown how research operations can evolve to extract insight \u2018nuggets\u2019 that become readily available to organisations to answer a whole range of questions and challenges over time.
