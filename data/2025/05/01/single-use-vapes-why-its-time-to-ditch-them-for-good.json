It became impossible to miss them on the ground of parks, pavements, playgrounds and beaches.\u00a0\u00a0How single-use vapes damage our environment\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0As well as being eyesores, discarded vapes have a hugely damaging impact on our environment and wildlife. Animals such as birds, fish, and marine mammals can mistake vapes for food and ingest poisonous chemicals. \u00a0\u00a0Whether littered or thrown in a bin and sent to landfill, single-use vapes also release substances like lead and mercury into our soil, rivers and streams. This damages ecosystems and habitats.\u00a0\u00a0The plastics used in these products are nearly impossible for nature to completely break down. Instead, they break into tiny pieces of \u2018microplastics\u2019 which can enter our food chains.\u00a0\u00a0These vapes may take a few days to finish, but their environmental harms stick around for a very, very long time. \u00a0\u00a0Say one \u2018disposable\u2019 vape promises about 600 puffs - its plastic casing will easily last for 600 years buried in the earth.\u00a0"

            "text": "An avalanche of waste \u00a0\u00a0After being used for a very short time, most single-use vapes are thrown away and the materials are not recycled.\u00a0\u00a0Last year, Material Focus estimated that almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or thrown away in general waste every week in the UK. That's the equivalent of eight being thrown away per second. \u00a0\u00a0This is extremely wasteful of the valuable resources contained in these vapes, such as cobalt and copper. In 2022, the same group found that more than 40 tonnes of lithium were discarded in single-use vapes. This is the same amount used to power 5,000 electric vehicles. \u00a0\u00a0For the small number of single-use vapes which are sent for recycling, it\u2019s a difficult job, because they contain many chemical components and are not designed to be taken apart. They usually have to be disassembled by hand \u2013 a slow and tricky process which struggles to match the avalanche of vapes that are produced and discarded. \u00a0\u00a0The lithium-ion batteries in these vapes can also cause fires, which risks the safety of waste management workers, firefighters and the public. \u00a0\u00a0In 2023 there were over 1,200 battery fires in bin lorries and waste sites across the UK -\u00a0 a 70% increase on the year before. Aside from the obvious safety issues, these fires are bad for the quality of air breathed by local communities.\u00a0\u00a0Time to turn the page\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Taking these products off the shelves by banning their sale and supply will help to tackle these problems.\u00a0It will prevent them from being thrown into bins with general waste, and littering of reusable alternatives will be reduced."

Over half of children who use vapes report that \u2018disposable\u2019 models are their product of choice.\u00a0"

Withdrawal can cause anxiety, irritability, trouble concentrating and headaches. \u00a0\u00a0What people who buy vapes should know\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019ve got a collection of used up vapes in a drawer at home, don't bin them.\u00a0\u00a0Return them to your vape supplier for recycling or take them to your nearest recycling point.\u00a0\u00a0What businesses who sell vapes should know \u00a0\u00a0Businesses that sell vapes should stop buying new stock of single-use vapes and sell all existing stock before 1 June 2025. If a vape is reusable, you\u2019ll still be able sell or supply it.\u00a0\u00a0Retailers have a legal duty to provide collection points for waste vapes to their customers.
