This marked the unconditional surrender of Germany and meant an end to nearly six years of a war. Some people celebrated early. Many people in Britain didn't wait for the official day of celebration and began the festivities as soon as they heard the news on 7 May. After years of wartime restrictions and dangers \u2013 from food and clothes rationing to blackouts and bombing raids \u2013 many were finally able to let loose and enjoy themselves."
