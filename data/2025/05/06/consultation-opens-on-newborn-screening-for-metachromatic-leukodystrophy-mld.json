            "text": "The committee, which had not previously considered screening for this condition, commissioned an evidence map in 2023, to evaluate the volume and type of existing evidence relating to newborn screening for MLD. The evidence map concluded that MLD should be added to the list of conditions the UK NSC regularly reviews, and that the topic should be looked at in more detail via an evidence summary."

            "text": "The more detailed evidence summary, completed by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd this year, looked at evidence on the accuracy of tests that could be used to screen for MLD and the effectiveness of treatments for babies identified by screening. It also considered evidence on the cost effectiveness of screening for MLD."

            "text": "There are 3 types of MLD based on the age that symptoms start: late infantile (typically before 30 months of age), juvenile (typically between 3 and 16 years of age) and adult (typically after the age of 16). The late infantile form is the most severe and most common form of MLD, comprising 50 to 60% of cases. It is estimated that around 1 in every 40,000 babies born in the UK will have MLD."

It is also approved for children with early MLD who have early signs or symptoms of the condition but who can still walk independently and have no decline in mental processes."

        {
            "text": "The summary concluded that key areas of uncertainty remain regarding the best way to identify babies with MLD, and whether identification of babies with MLD through newborn screening results in more effective treatment with better long-term outcomes.\u00a0Further work is needed on the evaluation of algorithms for MLD screening, and the establishment of cut-off values for use in the UK population. (A cut-off value is the point at which the test gives a positive or negative result for the condition.) The review noted that evidence generation is still at a relatively early stage and ongoing pilot studies and/or data collection from the first implemented screening programme (in Norway) are likely to inform future evidence reviews."
