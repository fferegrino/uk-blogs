            "text": "Hidden beneath the waves along the south coast of Cornwall lies an ancient marine habitat, maerl beds. These pink, twiglet-shaped rhodoliths are free-living, calcified red seaweeds forming intricate, three-dimensional structures on the seabed. They're not just beautiful, they're biodiversity powerhouses, acting as nurseries for young fish, locking up carbon and playing a vital role in our coastal ecosystems."

            "text": "Maerl grows at an incredibly slow pace; some beds in the Fal Estuary are thought to be up to 4,000 years old, but they are highly sensitive to damage. Recognised as a Priority Habitat under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, they are legally protected, and were recently identified by Natural England as one of the UK\u2019s most irreplaceable marine habitats."

        {
            "text": "These habitats deliver significant natural capital. They act as nurseries for key commercial species like scallops and crabs and support food chains for birds such as the great northern diver and Slavonian grebe - species for which the Falmouth Bay to St Austell Bay Special Protection Area (SPA) was designated. They also play a role in coastal resilience and carbon storage, helping to tackle climate change."

These ecological links strengthen the case for protecting maerl beds as a foundation for wider ecosystem function. Further research will help refine our understanding and shape future advice."
