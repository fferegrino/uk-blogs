As part of the programme, we have a university day every Friday, which allows us time to focus on our studies without it interfering with our work at DVLA."

            "text": "The MSc programme has been really helpful for my development. Not only has it helped me improve my practical coding skills but, through my university studies, it\u2019s also allowed me to dive into the theory behind it. This mix of hands-on experience and deeper knowledge means I can take what I\u2019m learning and apply it to different roles in software engineering, carrying that knowledge with me wherever I go."

They\u2019re always happy to offer their time and provide feedback on my work, which has really helped me grow as a developer. There are a few former master\u2019s degree students in my squad, who I've become good friends with, and they've been especially understanding whenever I\u2019ve needed advice."
