The review was conducted by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health (NCISH) and aimed to understand how universities currently respond to students in urgent need of help and how to help identify areas for improvement."

These findings point to key transition periods as times of heightened risk, when students may struggle with adapting to university life, being away from home, or navigating a new country and culture."

The review revealed several gaps in university practices. In three-quarters of cases, bereaved families were not included in serious incident reviews following a death. Many students who died by suicide were already known to universities and had experienced stresses like academic pressure, social isolation, or mental health struggles. \u00a0"
