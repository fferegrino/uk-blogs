They include\u00a0malaria,\u00a0West Nile virus, dengue\u00a0and\u00a0yellow fever. At UKHSA, our medical entomology teams play a vital role in monitoring and assessing new species and diseases that could threaten public health."

UKHSA vector surveillance systems have detected these mosquito species in the UK on a number of occasions, leading to rapid action to minimise their chances of establishing."

Now, West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. In July 2023, fragments of the virus were identified in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected from wetlands in Nottinghamshire. While the risk to the public remains very low, this marks a significant development in vector surveillance"

This will also reduce the common Culex pipiens mosquito which is transmitting Usutu virus to blackbirds."

This work is supported by our national tick surveillance scheme, which receives thousands of tick samples from the public, veterinary practices, GP surgeries and wildlife organisations, particularly during the peak season of April to June. The information collected helps map seasonal patterns and geographical distribution, while our Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) tracks positive cases of diseases like Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, correlating infections with potential exposure locations."

The recent detection of West Nile virus in British mosquitoes exemplifies this emerging threat. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are extending the active seasons and geographical range of ticks and mosquitoes, introducing new diseases to the UK like tick-borne encephalitis, which were previously absent in Britain except for cases associated with overseas travel. Without decisive action, these changes could substantially impact public health, increasing disease burden and straining healthcare systems."
