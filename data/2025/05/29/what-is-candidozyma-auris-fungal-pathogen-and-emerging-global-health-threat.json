They can spread silently, thrive in hospitals, resist multiple treatments, and survive on surfaces for weeks. That's\u00a0Candidozyma auris\u00a0(C. auris) - formerly known as\u00a0Candida auris\u00a0- a fungal pathogen gaining attention from healthcare professionals and public health authorities worldwide."

It was first identified in 2009 in the ear of a Japanese patient and has since been found in more than 40 countries across 6 continents. What makes\u00a0C. auris\u00a0particularly concerning is its remarkable resilience \u2013 it can survive on surfaces for long periods of time, including in the hospital environment, and is often resistant to first-line medical treatments and disinfectants."
