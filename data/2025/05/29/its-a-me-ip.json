To recover losses from the failed Radar Scope release, Nintendo tasked Shigeru Miyamoto, a staff artist with no game development experience, to repurpose the arcade game\u2019s expensive hardware. Despite his lack of experience, Miyamoto\u2019s creativity and fresh perspective set him apart in the gaming industry.
