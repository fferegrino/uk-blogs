QALYs are defined as: \u201cA measure of the state of health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted to reflect the quality of life. One quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is equal to 1 year of life in perfect health.\u201d[1]"

This allowed it to compare the costs and benefits of the proposed policy against the alternative of maintaining the current rules on tobacco sales."

            "text": "It is also complicated where different QALY values are used in different circumstances \u2013 for example NICE uses a value of \u00a320,000-30,000 per QALY for general assessments, but uses a higher value for ultra-rare diseases; while the DfT uses the Green Book value of \u00a370,000 per QALY."

        {
            "text": "Alternative tools for cost-effectiveness analysis have been developed. The Value of a Prevented Fatality (FPF) provides an estimate of the societal value of a small change in the probability of a fatality. Statistical Life Years (SLYs) consider the value to society of a small change to life expectancy. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) reflect years of life lost because of premature death and years lived with disability. All of these measures (together with QALYs) are estimated by averaging values from surveys across representative population samples."
