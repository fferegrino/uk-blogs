            "text": "It seems at first glance that the contrast between the Southern part of Greater Manchester and the Northern part of its neighbouring county Cheshire, is massive. Urban versus rural, grey rather than green, nature poor not nature rich, municipal parks in housing estates versus stately homes in historic parkland, Coronation Street versus the Real Housewives of Cheshire."

These multi-partnership projects are designed to fast-track nature recovery by working collaboratively to create and restore wildlife-rich habitats, corridors and stepping-stones to help wildlife populations to move around freely."

A string of well visited wildlife sites and green spaces follow this length of riverside, providing a vital nature corridor between housing, transport and industrial development."

The wide pathways between trees provide feeding routes for Pipistrelle and Daubenton\u2019s Bats; the rough grassland meadows support Grasshopper Warblers, Ringlet butterflies and provide a wealth of insects for Swifts to feed on.\u00a0\u00a0"
