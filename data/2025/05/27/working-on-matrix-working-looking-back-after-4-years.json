            "text": "In late 2020, as we considered how to introduce the DDaT Capability Framework and associated pay system, we were also keen to reinforce the importance of multi-disciplinary working. In the rush to create our teams for the then Department for International Trade (DIT), team structures grew organically at pace. Under pressure to deliver new systems, reporting lines had a rag-tag mix of professions, roles and services. Unfortunately, this led to pools of inconsistent practice and technology. This made quality control and cyber monitoring difficult, but it also meant it was hard to move people across priorities. We felt this impacted people\u2019s professional development and career opportunities, and our function felt too siloed from the rest of the department."
        },
        {
            "text": "With the possibility of a new pay and capability system coming in, we felt it was the ideal time to look at our structure overall. The DDaT Capability Framework defines a range of professions and roles within them. It also creates the structure for colleagues to progress on their capability scores as they demonstrate improving skills and knowledge. Increasing your capability score can lead to increased pay without having to change grade or job."

        {
            "text": "With help from North Highland, who had supported other parts of government to implement these frameworks, we collectively worked with our teams to plan our approach to this.\u00a0 We used a panel of staff volunteers as our main sounding board along with our leadership team to agree on these principles for our new structure:"
        },
        {
            "text": "Through this we aligned to a model where Heads of Profession line-managed their professions. Each Chief (SMT member, usually a Deputy Director) would sponsor several professions and so line manage the Heads of Profession. We ensured these professions, and their roles, aligned to the DDaT capability framework."
        },
        {
            "text": "Then we created portfolios for task management that reflected the department\u2019s priorities. For cross-cutting work, we recognised enabling teams that sat outside of the portfolios. Each Chief would sponsor one or more portfolios and so would be task managing multi-disciplinary teams to deliver those outcomes."
        },
        {
            "text": "It naturally took us some time to adjust to this way of working. It was more disruptive for some teams and professions than others. In the meantime, we continued to grow our permanent headcount, starting at roughly 120 to over 500 full time equivalents. This growth, as well as increased demands on us to deliver, created some tensions and strains in the ways of working. This was added to as we grew to take on a third of the former Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)."

I cannot do justice to all that we worked on since moving to this way of working.\u00a0 However, some key \u2018aha\u2019 moments were when we found much clearer language to explain what we meant. Sounds obvious but when everyone has such differing responses to similar words, and there are lots of us, it\u2019s vital."
        },
        {
            "text": "Working in collaboration we explored and agreed language. Lots of post-it notes (real and virtual) were used in getting there. In doing so we clarified our thinking on roles, responsibilities and how to negotiate on tricky issues like sharing resources."
        },
        {
            "text": "This led us to being more careful with our language for explaining and defining teams. Through this process we improved our understanding of the needs and purpose of teams, and so how best to support people in them."

As a result. we rearranged our portfolios, changed some of their names and re-cast some teams to be clearer in their purpose."

            "text": "We have since been working on clarifying the different roles Heads of Profession play in relation and contrast to those at the same seniority who are managing portfolios. As leaders who sit on both sides of the matrix \u2013 line and task management \u2013 we are reflecting on how our behaviours and preferences can nudge and influence outcomes."

        {
            "text": "Why does this matter? Why should anyone choose this type of matrix working?\u00a0 The reason why is it means you will have multidisciplinary working baked into your essence. You will have communities of professions supporting each other, developing common ways of working and learning. You will also have the flexibility to respond to the changing needs of your stakeholders: Portfolios and teams can shift and move (ours have many times now) without it becoming a whole \u2018restructure\u2019 with all the fear, uncertainty and delay that entails."
