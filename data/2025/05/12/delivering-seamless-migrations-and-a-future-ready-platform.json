As a Programme Manager, my role is to oversee the migration process. I have ensured it is incident-free and delivered on time, while also focusing on the successful onboarding of service teams onto a new platform designed for the future."

Additionally, given the tight deadline, we were developing the platform while simultaneously onboarding the first services. "

It took multiple iterations, significant improvements, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the patience and feedback of our users to get things right."
