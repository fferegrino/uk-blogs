We live in Nottinghamshire with our young daughter, and this year, we began our fostering journey after years of talking about it. With Foster Care Fortnight underway, we wanted to share our story in case you\u2019re thinking about fostering, or if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve never considered but might be interested in."

            "text": "After years of \"one day we will\" conversations, we finally took the leap. We\u2019re unable to have more biological children but with plenty of love to give, we wanted to open our home to children needing safety and stability. We also wanted our daughter to experience the joys and challenges of sibling relationships such as learning to share, care, and build close bonds. Fostering provided this opportunity while making a positive impact in our community."

While we know not every placement will be as smooth, this experience gave us confidence to continue."
