A grower supplying fresh tomatoes to major supermarkets noticed something troubling - the tomatoes looked mottled and discoloured, and the fruits were misshapen. At first, they thought it might be a nutrient issue or a common virus. But tests confirmed their fears: Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) had made it to their crop."

            "text": "Highly contagious and difficult to control, ToBRFV can slash tomato yields by up to 70%. In the United Kingdom (UK), this has led to losses of tens to hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the greenhouse complexes have had to be completely disinfected to prevent further spread.\u00a0In Florida, a major tomato producing state in the United States (US), the virus is estimated to put at risk an industry with an annual turnover of $262 million, further underscoring the need to prevent introduction and take swift action when found."

They knew what it was before the diagnostic results came back: Phytophthora ramorum - a destructive plant pathogen responsible for \u2018Sudden Larch Death\u2019 - was on the move again, silently reshaping landscapes across the UK. In a five-year period (2009-2014) the UK government spent \u00a321 million on managing and slowing the spread of P. ramorum disease."

GAP-DC is integrating both targeted and wide-ranging genomic techniques to enhance early pathogen detection, rapid response and effective disease control."
