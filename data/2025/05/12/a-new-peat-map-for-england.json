The map has the most detailed national coverage to date for peat depth, peatland vegetation, upland drainage channels, and upland bare peat, which are all important in determining peatland condition. It\u2019s published on an open access, easy to use web viewer and across a number of freely accessible government platforms.\u00a0"

It will be a key resource for government, for conservation organisations, and for anyone else working on the large-scale restoration of peatlands or the ecosystem services they provide. The map has been produced by the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment programme as part of a nationwide survey of our land, freshwater and coastal ecosystems to produce a baseline of our natural assets."

            "text": "We already know that many of our peatlands are in a poor condition, but limited data has made it hard to build a detailed picture of what is happening across England. The new England Peat Map allows us to see that around three quarters of our peatlands are covered by plants and land use types associated with drier conditions, such as arable and horticultural land, bare peat, broadleaved woodlands, or near or within built-up areas and gardens, rather than the wetland plants we\u2019d expect on healthy peatland. \u00a0At least 37% is dominated by heather, which flourishes under dry conditions, while just 1% is dominated by Sphagnum mosses \u2013 a key peat-forming plant group associated with wetlands. The map also shows the locations of many thousands of drainage channels, which are often closely connected to dried-out, deteriorating peatlands. Taken together, the data provides the most detailed understanding of peatland extent and features ever available at an England-wide scale. \u00a0"

It uses satellite imagery, pre-existing peat survey data, new field survey data, and data on geology, topography (LiDAR), and historic land use. These are then analysed using AI algorithms (machine learning and deep learning). Using these algorithms we have, without needing to visit sites in person, predicted where peat will be found and identified drainage channels right across upland peat landscapes."

            "text": "Without needing to manually survey every peat deposit in the country, the England Peat Map combines modelling and real-world data to give our best prediction of where peat is. Our models are trained on over 300,000 data points from field surveys. They have an overall accuracy measure of over 95% for the extent of peaty soils and 94% for vegetation and land cover. As a national-scale map it will be a vital part of the decision-making toolkit for local scale management, though needs to be used in conjunction with local evidence for site-level decisions."

Drained lowland agricultural peat soils are responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from England\u2019s peat, so improving mapping of these areas will be an important area of work for the future."

However, it\u2019s also a triumph of teamwork between the public, non-profit, and private sectors. Natural England wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the England Peat Map without generous contributions of data from 29 partner organisations \u2013 ranging from the National Trust and the Great North Bog partnership to Anglian Water. Together we\u2019ve moved from a fragmented, localised picture of England\u2019s peatlands to a joined-up, national one."

            "text": "England\u2019s peatlands and peaty soils are among our most valuable natural capital resources. New peat only forms at a rate of about 1mm a year, so by far the best way of ensuring that we continue to receive its benefits is by not letting it degrade in the first place and restoring damaged peatlands. Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that our peatlands\u2019 value as a source of drinking water is worth many hundreds of millions, while our 180 million hours of recreational visits to them were worth \u00a3274 million. But all this is dwarfed by their value as a carbon store. The value of reduced carbon emissions from restoring all peatlands in the UK would be between 5 and 10 times the cost of restoration. At a conservative estimate, restoring 55% of peatlands to near-natural condition would have a value of around \u00a350 billion. In allowing us to measure how much peat we have in locations across England, and the features of our peatland landscapes, the England Peat Map will give decision makers vital information to help them make the right choices for these irreplaceable national assets."
