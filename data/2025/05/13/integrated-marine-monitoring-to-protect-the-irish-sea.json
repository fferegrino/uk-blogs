It is also essential to tackling the challenges posed by pollution, climate change, and human activities. Long-term monitoring across the catchment to the coast is essential to fully understand how changing pressures impact coastal and marine environmental, social, and economic assets. By understanding the health of these waters through a collaborative approach, we can develop strategies to mitigate pollution and protect the unique biodiversity of the Irish Sea."

The Survey operates continuous plankton recorders, devices which collect plankton (phyto- and zooplankton, almost 700 taxa routinely identified) from surface waters, using a consistent methodology, throughout the North Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans. The \u2018IN\u2019 route has been operated from Liverpool to Dublin, running since 1970 and collecting over 4000 samples in that time. Plankton in each sample are then counted and identified as precisely as possible, often down to the species level. The resulting dataset is open access and has been used in a large number of research projects, as well as more applied work within the marine policy realm. Data from the CPR Survey, from both the IN route and surrounding North Sea / north-eastern Atlantic, can be used to put other plankton sampling results into a wider context, adding large spatial and temporal scales to look at changes in the community."

Under the Seascapes programme, we collected data to understand plume dynamics, asses high risk areas and understand the impacts of pollution on seagrass communities and oyster beds. Our data also helps validate the analysis of water quality, including the colour of the ocean and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) data.  A collaborative effort, which integrates data from multiple sources, can achieve a more comprehensive and accurate picture of ocean health, covering the full source to sea system. It also helps to improve our knowledge on coastal and marine assets that are contained within these important systems."
