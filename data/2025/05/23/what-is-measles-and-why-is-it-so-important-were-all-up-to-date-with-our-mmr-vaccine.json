Most of these cases were in unvaccinated children under the age of 10. We have also seen a resurgence of measles in Europe after the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0As families prepare for travel over the summer break, there is more chance for measles to be brought in from countries where there are outbreaks. Catching up children who missed out on their MMR vaccines is a priority, in order to help prevent another rise in measles cases."

Most people will feel better after 7 to 10 days, however measles can lead to complications such as ear and chest infections, fits and diarrhoea and dehydration in younger children. On rare occasions measles can also lead to infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or brain itself (encephalitis) which can lead to long term disabilities or even death."
