            "text": "The ability to export with confidence, knowing you\u2019ll get paid for an export contract or potentially recover costs is a key consideration for any business, including small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). Cover for export insurance from market lenders isn\u2019t always available or viable. Lenders may assess that the risk is too high for them to take on, or for exporters, particularly SMEs, the cost of cover may be too high. That\u2019s where UKEF can help by complimenting \u2013 and not competing with - lenders through our Export Insurance Policy (EXIP)."

This involved working closely with a User Researcher to define user personas (exporters, brokers, Export Finance Managers (EFMs), underwriters) and conduct user interviews, workshops and surveys. It also involved working with internal stakeholders to understand business constraints, identify potential opportunities and how we would measure success."

            "text": "During alpha, we tested our risky assumptions and worked closely with the internal stakeholders on policy changes. As part of alpha outcomes, I documented user stories, written from the user\u2019s perspective with acceptance criteria that our software developers could use to begin coding in beta. These user stories were used to form the foundation for the service improvement strategy and roadmap"

I also consider the alignment of my service to the whole organisational estate. For this to happen I may need to speak with colleagues about changing processes and procedures, consider emerging technologies, regulatory requirements, industry best practice and market alignment. In this case our insurance policy guidelines were re-written to make it more closely aligned with private market wording."

By breaking down the project into smaller, manageable phases (known as sprints), I can ensure that progress is made while maintaining flexibility to adapt to evolving needs. This allows for early validation of new design concepts and quick adjustments based on user feedback."
