Skills are, of course, crucial to economic growth and a successful industrial strategy, both of which we support. "

This is where competition law \u2013 and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) \u2013 can play a role."

We can also support collaborations that benefit the UK by making clear that we won\u2019t prioritise enforcement. This was the case in the development of cutting-edge cancer therapies and businesses working together to achieve their environmental goals. We think the higher education sector could benefit in a similar way."

This type of collaboration may not be a problem \u2013 an example might be where there are many providers offering a course nationally and the course tends to attract students from across the country who will have other good options. However, because this is a more complex area, we are working to understand what collaborations may be under consideration and how these fit with the overall plans for higher education reform."

We will keep you updated on our thinking as it develops, as we continue to engage higher education providers and the government on how we can best assist the sector \u2013 for example through providing bespoke advice or issuing further guidance. This will support work by the government, which expects to set out its plan for higher education reform by the summer."
