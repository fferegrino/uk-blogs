It\u2019s humbling to see how much of the digital world becomes difficult to use under these conditions. Highlighting the need for inclusive and thoughtful design."

Leaving Sheffield, we carried a renewed resolve to champion accessibility. The best accessibility work ensures people don't need to ask for help in the first place."
