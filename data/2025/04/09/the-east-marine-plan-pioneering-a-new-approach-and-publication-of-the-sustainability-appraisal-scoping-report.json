The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs subsequently agreed with this recommendation and work began on developing the first second-generation English marine plan, marking a significant milestone for the Marine Planning team."

This innovative method was developed in collaboration with Natural England and ensures that natural capital assets and ecosystem services are thoroughly considered when assessing sustainability. This marks a first for such an approach to be taken for a SA of an English marine plan and the SA Scoping Report sets out the proposed methodology for undertaking it."
