            "text": "All screening can do harm as well as good. Potential harms, including false positive results, false negative results, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, also apply to IFs detected by screening. The detection of some IFs might lead to needless or harmful treatment. Others might be benign, clinically insignificant or not have associated interventions that can help, so their disclosure might cause unnecessary anxiety."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is therefore essential that national screening programmes have clear and consistent guidance on how IFs are managed, reported and communicated. This helps prevent referrals of clinically insignificant findings and optimise the follow-up of findings when interventions could be hugely beneficial. Screening programmes are also very expensive, so management of IFs should be cost-effective, where possible."

            "text": "The main purpose of lung cancer screening is to find lung cancer, not other conditions. However, the low dose thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan used in lung cancer screening can detect a large number and variety of IFs. Identifying many of these, for example findings linked to smoking-related conditions, can greatly improve a person\u2019s health. But some IFs can do more harm than good if we communicate them to patients."

        {
            "text": "Given how common IFs are in lung cancer screening, it is therefore important we provide health professionals with clear consistent guidance about which findings to communicate to patients and what follow-up actions to take."

It explains the potential significance of each finding, how and when it should be reported and what action the screening programme should take in each case. This can range from no action at all \u2013 for example, in the case of a finding of bronchial wall thickening \u2013 to an urgent referral for surgery if a large abdominal aortic aneurysm is detected."
