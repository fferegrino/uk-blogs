This ambitious project has already restored 24 nature sites, linking them together with nature-friendly farming and wildlife-rich corridors, to form a landscape of 9200 hectares. It\u2019s a partnership project formed of wildlife charities, community groups, local authorities and landowners led by Cambridge Past Present and Future and the Wildlife Trust for Beds Cambs and Northants."
