            "text": "In September 2022 energy prices hit a record high. Homes and businesses across the country were impacted \u2013 and so were the many schools and trusts whose energy contracts were due to be renewed around that time. Many were locked into long term, fixed price contracts at a time when the energy prices were at their peak. This would have a serious impact on those schools\u2019 budgets for years to come."

            "text": "The Get help buying for school team was able to help some schools and trusts negotiate contract extensions with existing suppliers, but it was obvious it was a priority for the Schools Commercial Team at DfE to look for a longer-term solution to offer better protection from this unregulated part of the market."
        },
        {
            "text": "Energy prices have increased, and the long-term outlook is for prices to remain high with the market continuing to be susceptible to volatility. Most schools currently have fixed term, fixed price contracts. Whilst offering some certainty in pricing they are inherently risky and leave a school exposed to whatever the daily rate is upon their contract expiry; in the case of the 2022 crisis schools adopting this method of buying their energy saw their bills more than double."

            "text": "Whilst this contract is flexibly priced, rather than fixed, some of the energy is bought up front, during the 30 months prior to delivery and then during the delivery period itself. This helps to level out the peaks and troughs in price variances."

The DfE become the \u2018contracting authority\u2019 and help schools to onboard to the new contract. Schools continue to get their own energy usage data and pay their own bills direct to the supplier."
