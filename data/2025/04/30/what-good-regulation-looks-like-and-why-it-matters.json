            "text": "Firstly, good regulation upholds the interests of UK consumers and businesses. We would be falling at the first hurdle if we didn\u2019t get that right. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been clear since joining the CMA that, though we must evolve, we\u2019re sticking firmly to the fundamentals \u2013 protecting UK consumers and promoting competition. Recent work underscores that commitment \u2013 like our recommendations to government for improvements to the infant formula market, our Ticketmaster investigation, and the launch of our first two investigations under the new Digital Markets competition regime."

            "text": "Good regulation also supports critical, long-term policy goals, and the broader macro-economic environment in which they are formed. Most notably, the UK desperately needs economic growth. It\u2019s the only way out of today\u2019s world of high debt, record tax take and intense pressure on public expenditure. It\u2019s our only route to prosperity for ordinary working families, with better public services, infrastructure and quality of life. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the government\u2019s number one mission \u2013 and why all regulators must play their part in helping achieve it.\u00a0"

So, for the CMA, good regulation also means really challenging ourselves on how we can encourage this to the greatest extent, while staying true to our fundamentals.\u00a0"

            "text": "There\u2019s a lot we can do for growth and investment through opening up markets to competition, as we did with Open Banking; levelling the playing-field for SMEs, like we did with online marketplaces; and strengthening consumer confidence as we start to implement the new consumer protection regime."

        {
            "text": "But we can go further \u2013 by making meaningful changes to how we carry out our work. Changes that matter to businesses, investors, and startups thinking about whether to choose the UK, over anywhere else in the world, as their home. We\u2019re now actively implementing improvements across \u20184Ps\u2019: the Pace of our end-to end-processes; the Predictability and Proportionality of our actions and decisions (including a sharper focus on UK versus global impact); and our Process, meaning the direct engagement we have with businesses and wider stakeholders. We\u2019re already making considerable headway with this 4Ps framework across core areas of our work, including mergers, consumer protection and digital markets \u2013 really listening and responding to feedback as we go."

            "text": "When it comes to good regulation, the UK\u2019s new Digital Markets competition regime (opens in new tab) has the virtue of already exemplifying many aspects of these 4Ps. It\u2019s designed to keep pace with fast-moving markets and technologies, while not trying to predict the future. It\u2019s highly tailored, applying just to the largest firms and offering the opportunity for scalpel-like remedies, not an industry-wide sledgehammer. And it\u2019s based on ongoing dialogue with firms and the wider ecosystem, collaborating on solutions which work in practice. It\u2019s early days, but progress so far is already starting to show the benefits of a bespoke UK regime."
