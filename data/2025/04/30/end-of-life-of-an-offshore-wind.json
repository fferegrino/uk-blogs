            "text": "The UK has been an early adopter of offshore wind, installing turbines in our waters since the turn of the century. We now boast 14.7GW of installed capacity, and in 2023 offshore wind produced 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs. Many of the earliest offshore wind farms are now reaching the end of their operational life. Over the next decade, the UK could lose over 1GW of capacity, rising to more than 10GW by 2050. Some sites may be able to extend their lifespan through repair and maintenance, while others could be suitable for repowering\u2014where the site is reused but all infrastructure is replaced with new technology. In some cases, full decommissioning will be required. Selecting the appropriate end-of-life option, and the level of decommissioning needed, will demand careful consideration of technical, financial, environmental, and social factors, with input from both industry and government."

            "text": "To support this, the Strategic Renewables Unit is convening a cross-government working group to raise early awareness of offshore wind end-of-life challenges, establish clear expectations, and provide guidance to industry on their decommissioning responsibilities. The first workshop, taking place in May 2025, will bring together government departments, regulators, the Crown Estate, and Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies (SNCBs) to share expertise and ensure a joined-up, strategic approach to managing the end of life of offshore wind."
