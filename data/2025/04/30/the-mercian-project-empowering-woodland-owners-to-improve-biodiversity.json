With a Forestry Commission woodland management plan in place for the commercial extraction of timber, Ros joined the project for support to enhance the woodland\u2019s ecological value.\u00a0"

This work, funded through the local council's district level licensing scheme for great crested newts, has created valuable new habitat."
