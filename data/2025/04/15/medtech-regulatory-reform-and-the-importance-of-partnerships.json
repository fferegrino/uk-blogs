Risk-proportionate regulation, which ensures patient safety whilst supporting innovation and access, will underpin the availability of these transformative technologies and is a key consideration for the multitude of stakeholders who need to work together to deliver change."

Working in partnership with stakeholders across national and devolved governments and with the NHS, patients, academia, and industry is essential as we progress with the reforms to medical device regulations. In this blog, I reflect on the importance of partnership working in our regulatory approach and highlight some of the key partnerships the MHRA\u2019s Innovative Devices team is engaging with."

Understanding the potential impact of emerging technologies and the regulatory opportunities and challenges they pose are important considerations as we update our framework. To support this work, the MHRA, the Office for Life Sciences, UK Research and Innovation, the Medical Research Council, and Innovate UK launched the UK Centres of Excellence for Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSIs) in January to advance regulatory science and ensure the UK\u2019s regulatory system is fit for the future. The end of March saw an important milestone as the seven CERSIs came together for the first time to discuss their goals, challenges and ways of working. With an opening address by Lord Vallance, the meeting was brimming with excitement and a palpable sense of optimism for an approach that is fundamentally centred on effective collaboration between partners."

I look forward to seeing the outputs from the teams and working with them to shape our future regulatory enhancements and innovative regulatory approaches."

The value of early engagement between developers, regulators and health system partners was clear to see at the AI Airlock Connect event held on 11th March. Baroness Merron and Dr June Raine joined the four innovators and many partners taking part in our AI Airlock pilot, to share valuable insights into the regulation of AI as a medical device. The AI Airlock will be critical to help us ensure early access to effective and safe products."

International partnerships are key to ensuring that harmonised regulatory approaches support UK patient access and international trade. Last month, we attended the 27th International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) Management Committee meeting in Tokyo where we provided updates and joined panel discussions with international regulators and industry partners across three important areas:"

We are now reviewing this feedback to make necessary amendments for clarity and to finalise the guidance. We do not expect the guidance to change significantly, and manufacturers should continue using it to support the implementation of the new requirements. The feedback will also help us develop new guidance to further enhance support as part of ongoing improvements."

A Statutory Instrument has been laid in Parliament to retain four pieces of assimilated EU law until they are replaced. This follows the publication of our consultation response which showed stakeholders favoured this approach. The SI is scheduled for debate in both Houses after the Easter recess and we\u2019re working with Ministers to support this process."

We look forward to more engagement and dialogue as we move forward with the upcoming publication of the government response to the routes to market consultation, the World Trade Organization notification of the pre-market Statutory Instrument and identifying priorities for future enhancements."
