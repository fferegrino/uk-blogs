This approach combines Delivery and Operations teams working together to automate processes through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which results in rapid deployments all the way through to production."

            "text": "For DEFRA, a delivery platform would eliminate much of the need for repetitive infrastructure building and strengthen overall governance and security requirements. It would reduce the\u00a0 long term cost and tech debt of projects, which is the build-up of future work due to time constraints. Most importantly, a delivery platform would allow project teams to focus on the business and public value add of their services."

The examples we found shaped the core principles of the CDP, which were then adapted to fit DEFRA\u2019s specific technology stack needs, accommodate its existing proven approaches, and align to its technical strategy."

            "text": "Once the discovery stage was complete, the CDP took shape as a cloud-hosted platform. As a result, teams do not need to build or understand the underlying cloud infrastructure that hosts the CDP, whether that might be AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Instead, they only need to build their service for the CDP itself, where users are provided with a set of common patterns to assure adherence to development standards."
