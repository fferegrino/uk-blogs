All of these improvements were made with the help of conveyancers, legal professionals, and Digital Registration Service users, who continue to provide us with valuable insights and real life scenarios of how they use the service and where further enhancements could be considered to improve their experiences."

            "text": "These developments came from users' comments that identified they found it difficult to enter additional parties to applications, such as when a proprietor has died or a guardian is acting. Our research has shown that this results in requisitions because parties are not accounted for in panel 13 of the e-AP1."

Digital applications are crucial for helping HM Land Registry deliver faster registration services and automating more of our work, which minimises the risk of human error."

To further prevent requisitions, customers will also be prompted to upload evidence of compliance with their application \u2013 in the \u2018attach documents\u2019 screen \u2013 if it is necessary."
