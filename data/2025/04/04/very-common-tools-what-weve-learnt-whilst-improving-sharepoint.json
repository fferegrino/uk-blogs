But for those who haven\u2019t, SharePoint is similar to Dropbox and Google Drive, except you can also use it to create web pages around your files. This is why it can function in ways similar to Wikipedia, while also being a folder system.\u00a0"

This is where user researchers and content designers can make a difference. We are sharing our findings because we think they can be useful for anyone responsible for a SharePoint. If you can take command of your filing and informational resources, you can not only make them more accessible and usable, but you can also change the ways people think about the services available to them. Doing so is a key part of CTaaS\u2019s agenda, and it advances MHCLG\u2019s Digital Strategy by enhancing our operational excellence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

We can only speculate as to why, but it seems likely that by clicking around, users expect to learn more about the site and therefore improve their chances of finding other things in the future. Meanwhile, searching (a behaviour adopted by a minority) was more efficient than scrolling and clicking around, as was using the site\u2019s A to Z library. There were times, though, where searching was less effective, such as when searching for words that can have a wide variety of meanings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
