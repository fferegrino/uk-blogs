Post Implementation Reviews (PIRs) check whether regulations are achieving their objectives or if they are imposing excessive costs. In doing so, they support the Government\u2019s growth agenda and its pledge to reduce the administrative costs of regulations by 25%."

            "text": "The RPC has been concerned over many years at departments\u2019 failure to complete PIRs. We are concerned because it means that departments do not have the evidence to correct past mistakes or suggest how to improve future regulatory decisions; it is also generally a statutory requirement."

            "text": "One of our earliest Blogs in 2021 reported that only 40% of PIRs were being completed on time. Since then, we have repeatedly raised this issue, most recently in February this year, where my Blog commended Defra for reducing their backlog of 56 PIRs, but noted that many other departments were still not meeting their statutory requirements to complete PIRs on time (or at all)."

Today we are releasing that information for the first time in the form of a league table of outstanding PIRs."

A spreadsheet with all the outstanding PIRs split by department is on our website here."
