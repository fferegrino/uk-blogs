Some examples include West Nile fever, Tick-Borne Encephalitis fever and Rift Valley fever."

            "text": "To better understand the transmission and control of vector borne diseases, it is important that we are able to correctly identify the vector species (known as taxonomy) and draw on sound ecological knowledge. Understanding the species that is critical for pathogen transmission can help us better understand the distribution of disease and apply the appropriate control methods against the target vector species."

            "text": "However, one in five insect species are species complexes. These species are difficult to identify using the arthropod structure alone. We therefore rely on the use of genetic methods of identification. Integrating these methods has been a key task for the Biodiversity Research Team, led by Dr Hern\u00e1ndez-Triana within the Vector-Borne Diseases Research Group at APHA."

In addition, this approach has been applied to separate tick species (for example Ixodes canisuga, Ix. hexagonus and Ix. ricinu) found from a range of hosts such as foxes and birds."
