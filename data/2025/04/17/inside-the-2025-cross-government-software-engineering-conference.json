Several parts of its core six-point plan depend on building and maintaining strong communities of digital practitioners across government departments.From lessons learned within our own groups, this will introduce a range of clear benefits, including:"

            "text": "An important part of any community are the bonds between its individuals. That\u2019s why events like the Cross Government Software Engineering Conference are so vital - they provide a space for people to meet and create those bonds. While our conferences were previously held virtually or with smaller teams, we organised this event to allow the wider software engineering network to engage at a much larger scale.The event would also tackle big challenges, such as how to build software that lasts, how to improve services over time, and how to boost public trust. That\u2019s why we wanted to use this event to bring together developers from across government to share best practices and highlight what works and what still needs to be improved.\u00a0Important to this was making sure we could drive home the message to senior leaders - that supporting digital delivery should be a top priority, and that this can be accelerated by supporting industry best practice and ways of working for software engineering.The day was only made possible by our generous sponsors: GovCamp and Government Digital Service (GDS). In the spirit of sustainability and accessibility, we made sure that the conference was a low-budget event with topics crowd-sourced from community coordinators.As a result of everyone\u2019s efforts, the conference was met with such incredible enthusiasm that tickets sold out.We structured the day of the event itself to allow time for detailed subject talks and case study presentations. We also made sure that there would be vital networking time, because informal connections are often just as important as the more formal sessions."

It was clear that being able to share best practices, challenges and opportunities in person is vital.The success of this conference has illustrated the need for similar future events, which we will be planning for soon. It has also allowed us to show senior leaders the importance and impact of providing these spaces for the community."
