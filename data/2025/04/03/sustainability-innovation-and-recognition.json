My responsibilities are wide-ranging, from overseeing our IT systems and financial business management to driving sustainability initiatives."

            "text": "Interviewer: Congratulations on your team receiving the Commander\u2019s Commendation award! How did it feel to be recognised?Lucy: It was fantastic to be nominated by an organisation outside the Defence Academy. It\u2019s a powerful acknowledgment of the team\u2019s hard work. What stands out to me is that sustainability isn\u2019t part of the team\u2019s core responsibilities. Over the last few years, people have embraced this space simply because they believe in its importance. Also, collaborating with our on-site contractors Serco and ESS has been incredibly rewarding."

            "text": "First, there\u2019s our moral responsibility as human beings to care for the planet. Second, as Crown Servants, we have a duty to deliver value for money and efficiency across government initiatives. Many of our sustainability ideas align with creating more resilient, cost-effective solutions for the future."

By adopting innovative approaches and adapting to extreme environments, we\u2019re building a more capable and resilient Defence. This concept resonates with people\u2014they see how their efforts contribute to something much larger."

One initiative we\u2019re particularly proud of is a scheme similar to the \u2018Boris\u2019 bikes scheme in partnership with Serco. This allows people to cycle around the site instead of relying on cars."

For example, our Single Living Accommodation (SLA) block and Medical Centre are being developed to meet Defence Related Environmental Assessment Methodology (DREAM) Excellent standards, aiming for Net Zero buildings. We\u2019re electrifying heating systems to reduce dependence on natural gas, and our small solar farm is already helping to cut electricity consumption from the grid."

The composter turns food scraps, peelings, left-over food, coffee grounds, compostable packaging and garden waste into very nutrient rich compost, resulting in no food waste leaving the site."

You don\u2019t need to tackle everything at once. Small, meaningful interventions can capture people\u2019s attention and encourage them to rethink their actions."
