This would contain around 820 tonnes of carbon (3,009 tonnes of CO2). Compared to 10ha of oak that would produce around 1,300m3 of stem wood containing 364 tonnes of carbon (1,336 tonnes of CO2) in the same period.2"

Therefore, from a net zero viewpoint, planting conifer spares more land than broadleaf woodland and this efficiency is an increasingly important subject as competition for land for food production, energy production, nature recovery and house building intensify."
