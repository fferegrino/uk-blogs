            "text": "To help government services integrate with GOV.UK One Login, their service teams need to understand how it works. This can be challenging, as our service isn\u2019t a single, linear journey but a multi-channel journey that involves a collection of triage pages and interrupted journeys. It also evolves constantly, with frequent updates to meet diverse user and service needs. This pace of change can make it challenging for other government department service teams to stay up to date and understand what they need to integrate with."

While we share user journeys through tools like Figma and presentation slides, these can be difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with our service. Keeping them updated also takes considerable effort, meaning they don\u2019t always reflect the latest version."

Internal tools like Mural and our staging environment offered some support but faced similar challenges with usability and maintenance. Additionally, teams\u2014including those who directly support users\u2014need a clear understanding of the journey."

Teams can report issues via a feedback form, and updates follow a federated model, allowing anyone with prototyping skills to contribute. Changes are reviewed through pull requests, guided by a runbook. We have used GitHub not only to host the prototype but also to serve as living documentation through release notes, making it easy for anyone to track the evolution of the service."
