We may suffer the sad loss of a loved one and find ourselves dealing with their estate. In this situation, using our probate service becomes a reality. We might find ourselves owed money by a person or business and need the help of our civil money claims service to resolve the problem. Or through tribunals, we could need to appeal life changing decisions like unfair dismissal at work or about the benefits we rely on to provide for our families and those close to us. At times like these we all deserve to access efficient services that won\u2019t make a tough situation more difficult."

Since 2019, Crispin\u2019s application is one of over 500,000 applications made digitally. He and so many others benefit from a more accessible and modernised service. 24/7 access to their online applications, clear intuitive guidance, consistent support available directly from our knowledgeable Service Centre staff. This is how it should be for the people we serve."

Before we reformed these services, people challenging decisions made by powerful organisations or agencies described a hard, slow process. For those where English wasn\u2019t their first language it was worst. These were very real barriers to accessing justice. Over 600,000 tribunal users have benefitted from modernised services that have transformed a range of tribunals appeals process."

Everyone involved in delivering a service are centrally located and under one roof. Issues can be identified, addressed and resolved far more quickly and efficiently. It has put an end for the need to send information and instructions across multiple locations. Our Service Centre and National Business Centres dealt with over 2.8 million calls during  2024, many from people looking for support and information about civil, family or tribunals cases."

We can see the results of this engagement - in January 2024 there was a backlog of 76,500 probate applications which we reduced to 37,200 in January 2025. This is thanks to a modern service and innovative working with experts in the field."
