This word can feel abstract, yet as we celebrate World Quantum Day and 100 years of quantum science and technology on Monday 14 April 2025, it's clear this field is poised to reshape sectors, from security to healthcare. Just as IT literacy evolved from machine code specialists to everyday users, quantum literacy will span a spectrum, which will be valuable at every level.\u00a0"

Now, shrink down, far, far smaller than anything visible to the scale of atoms and the particles within them. This is the quantum world, and it operates by a different set of rules\u2014enter quantum mechanics.\u00a0\u00a0"

This seeming ambiguity at the quantum level is not a weakness; it\u2019s a superpower, as it allows quantum systems to explore vast numbers of possibilities in parallel, an asset for quantum computing. Also, for secure communications, we can leverage quantum correlations between particles across long distances to detect eavesdroppers. If someone tries to listen in, it will disrupt the correlation, alerting the parties involved of the intrusion.\u00a0"
