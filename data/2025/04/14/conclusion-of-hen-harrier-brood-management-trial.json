Investigation and enforcement of wildlife crime is the responsibility of the police, and Natural England works closely with the police and the National Wildlife Crime Unit to support their investigations. However, law enforcement alone has, to date, failed to stop the illegal killing of hen harriers, and ways of encouraging coexistence of hen harriers and grouse shooting interests have been explored, in partnership with game shooting organisations.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "One way of promoting coexistence, brood management, involves maintaining the density of hen harrier nests on grouse moors at a set level, by removing the eggs and/or chicks from hen harrier nests under licence, rearing the birds in captivity, and releasing them back into the wild at a suitable location once able to fly and disperse. This was predicted to increase the confidence of moorland managers that the predation and disturbance of grouse by nesting hen harriers could be legally managed at levels compatible with grouse shooting, and in turn lead to changes in attitudes and reduced illegal killing of hen harriers.\u00a0"

            "text": "A plan to experimentally trial brood management was set out in the 2016 Hen Harrier Action Plan. Research licences to carry out brood management of hen harriers were issued from 2018 to 2024, with brood management carried out during 2019 to 2023 by a partnership of the Moorland Association, the International Centre for Birds of Prey, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Hawk and Owl Trust and Natural England. Over that period, 15 broods were taken from the wild, with the young birds later released, many carrying satellite tags. Records were kept of numbers and habitat of nesting hen harriers in England, survival rates of tagged birds (both wild and brood managed), and incidents of illegal killing. Two social science studies and a population modelling analysis were carried out.\u00a0"

            "text": "A Natural England-led evaluation of the evidence has concluded that it is likely that the availability of brood management has led to more hen harriers successfully breeding on grouse moors. The social science research suggests that this is unlikely to be due solely to an increase in moorland managers\u2019 confidence that the impacts of hen harriers on grouse can be effectively managed. Instead, motivations to increase hen harrier numbers could be attributed to moorland managers\u2019 desire to demonstrate a commitment to wildlife conservation and to grouse shooting as a sport more widely, despite a cost to business, with brood management working as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to allay concerns about hen harrier numbers increasing to levels at which grouse shooting would be uneconomical. \u00a0"
