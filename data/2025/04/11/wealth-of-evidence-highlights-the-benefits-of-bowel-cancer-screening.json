It's a good opportunity to highlight research analysis, along with data from the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England, that provides clear evidence of the benefits of bowel cancer screening. Regular screening reduces both the risk of getting bowel cancer and the risk of dying from the condition. Research shows an estimated 186 bowel cancers are prevented for every 100,000 people screened over a 15-year period.[1]"

            "text": "Bowel cancer screening can detect cancer early, even when there are no symptoms. It can also detect polyps, which are abnormal growths that can develop into cancer over time. Removing polyps is a relatively simple procedure that can reduce the chance of developing bowel cancer in the future."

        {
            "text": "The screening programme sends out a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit, and people use this kit to return a sample of faeces (poo) for testing in a laboratory. If blood is found in the sample, the programme invites that person for further tests, which can include a colonoscopy \u2013 an examination of the lining of the large bowel during which any polyps can be removed."

            "text": "FIT can detect human blood in faeces at lower concentrations than the gFOBt. It can detect more cancers, particularly advanced adenomas (tumours that may become cancers), and results in more polyps being removed at colonoscopy that might otherwise grow into cancers. Screening is not perfect, and there will always be some cancers that are missed (a false negative result) and some results which suggest people have cancer when they do not (a false positive result). FIT returns fewer false positive results than gFOBt.\u00a0"

Since April 2019 when FIT was introduced, national bowel cancer screening uptake has increased from under 60% to nearly 70%. This increase has been particularly marked in under-served groups with historically low screening uptake."
