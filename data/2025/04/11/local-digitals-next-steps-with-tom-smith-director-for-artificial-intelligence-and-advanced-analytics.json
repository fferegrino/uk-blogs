The English Devolution White Paper, Local Government Reform, and the Blueprint for Modern Digital Government set a clear direction: digital and data transformation must be central to how councils evolve. AI and other emerging technologies present new opportunities to improve efficiency, service delivery, and collaboration across the sector."

At the same time, the public sector must navigate change carefully. While adopting new technologies comes with challenges, failing to do so is an even bigger risk."
