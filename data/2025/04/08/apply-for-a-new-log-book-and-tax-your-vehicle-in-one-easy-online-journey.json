Our answer was to link the online vehicle log book service to the online vehicle tax service, so you can tax your vehicle at the same time. Previously, you would have had to wait for your replacement log book to arrive before you could tax your vehicle. But now, due to this service update, you can continue to use your vehicle instead of keeping it off the road."

Our Customer Insight team brought together a cross-section of volunteers from across the country to try the service. We asked them to apply for a new log book with the end goal of taxing the vehicle. This allowed us to observe how real people naturally interacted with the service, their understanding of the process, and how they felt about the way the services were linked."

We took that on board, made slight tweaks and tested again with a different set of volunteers. This time, feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Our volunteers especially liked being able to tax without needing to wait for the log book to drop through their letterbox."
