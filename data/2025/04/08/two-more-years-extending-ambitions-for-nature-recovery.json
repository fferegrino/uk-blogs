Now is thus a good moment to not only look ahead, but to also offer some reflections on the path we have taken over the past six years towards Nature recovery."

Catastrophic fires and floods from California to Australia, and from Germany to Pakistan are among the extremes that increasingly accompany rapid global warming. Here in England, the 2022 heatwave, that for the first time ever took temperatures above 40 degrees, caused almost 3,000 excess deaths, while flooding the following year washed away a fifth of farming income \u2013 a \u00a31 billion blow to our economy, not to mention the devastating effects on families and their businesses."

            "text": "None of this is going away and is unfortunately set to get worse. As responses are being planned, it is obvious we cannot address global heating without also tackling the loss of Nature, reliant as we are on its ability to provide us with food and water, to sustain public health, to regulate our climate and to help us adapt to what are now inevitable changes. These linkages between climate and Nature were recognised by nations at the landmark COP 26 conference hosted by the UK in Glasgow in 2021."

How we square all of this off \u2013 reducing emissions, restoring Nature and facilitating growth \u2013 is a tough challenge, but at Natural England we are planning for how we can play our most impactful role."

With ongoing damage being inflicted on the planet\u2019s life support systems, finding ways to grow Nature at the same time as growing communities and the economy really is a prerequisite for a sustainable future."

Recovering Nature for Growth, Health and Security outlines what we plan to do in placing a restored natural world at the heart of the Government\u2019s key priorities. As we look forward and to adopting new ways of approaching our mission via this new strategy, I find huge encouragement from looking back to what we managed to achieve during the past 6 years, working in common cause with such a wide range of partners."

This was later bolstered by a new Global Biodiversity Framework, that was in some large part achieved by the efforts of the UK, including the need to protect 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030."

More than 50 of these ambitious programmes are under way across England, with some of the first round now completing their two-year development phase and moving to implementation."

It is a similar story with new Sites of Special Scientific Interest, such as the Dearne Valley in South Yorkshire which is transforming a former coalfield into a place where people can enjoy such rare wonders willow tits."

This pioneering step has generated interest around the world. Another Environment Act provision was the initiation of Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS), and again Natural England has been working across the country to assist in making these strategies quality plans for the recovery of Nature during the years ahead."

It came just after I returned from Biodiversity COP 16 in Colombia and really brought home to me how the high-level discussions there need to be translated into local delivery of the sort displayed by the energetic and committed members of that LNRS."

This can be seen in the King\u2019s Series of National Nature Reserves, launched with the support of His Majesty the King in 2023, beginning with the Lincolnshire Coronation Coast NNR which will make 33 sq. km of dunes, marsh and mudflat \u2013 and their rich array of wildlife \u2013 more accessible to some of the 10 per cent most deprived neighbourhoods in England living within walking distance of the reserve. The Natural England Board has so far approved a total of ten new NNRs in the King\u2019s Series and will add a further 15 during the coming three years. Some of them are large and are taking Nature recovery to a new level in the landscapes where they are located."

The new NNRs, plus new SSSIs and new Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs), the Landscape Recovery Projects and Nature Recovery Projects, are all pointing in that direction, while the LNRSs offer more potential for the future."

I hope that the natural treasures along our shores will encourage many to explore our newest national trails \u2013 the King Charles III England Coast Path and the upgraded Coast to Coast Path \u2013 which are due to be completed soon."

One of my personal highlights has been the work we have carried out with a number of government agencies and many partners down the years to establish the science, evidence and regulatory framework needed to enable the careful return of beavers to our waterways, following an absence of more than four centuries. Not only was this policy a seismic moment in our nation\u2019s natural history, it gives one of our most charismatic (and ecologically transformative) species the chance to drive forward Nature recovery across our landscape."

In 2019 Natural England issued a licence to the Roy Dennis Foundation and Forestry England to undertake the careful release of young birds brought from Scotland at the Isle of Wight. In 2023 I was taken to see the first nest of such birds in England for 240 years."

The growing extent to which Nature is acknowledged as being essential for people\u2019s health and wellbeing is now apparent in mainstream thinking and policy. It can be seen, for example, in the work on green social prescribing projects in which the NHS, Natural England and a range of bodies have come together to help put Nature at the centre of improving mental health and tackling health inequalities."

It won\u2019t be easy, of course, with a rapid reshaping of the world order taking place at the same time as continuing pressures on household and national budgets, all of which will no doubt lead some to conclude that Nature recovery is an unaffordable luxury when increased spending on defence, health and development is needed."

Natural England\u2019s State of Natural Capital report, published last year, reminded us that 90 per cent of the world\u2019s food is derived from just 20 species, while in this country alone the farming industry is dependent on the \u00a3500 million service provided by pollinating insects."

Insurance leaders fear that climate and Nature-based disasters of the scale of the recent fires in California and flooding in Spain are making many properties uninsurable and threatening the entire future of an industry which in turn underpins the banking industry. We also have rising demand for public health services, including for conditions that we know can benefit from access to natural areas. So much for healthy Nature being a luxury."

The Government is setting out the means to enable this to take place, including alongside moves to step up the pace of building homes and infrastructure, via the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, facilitating the kinds of more strategic approaches that could achieve so much for planners, developers, the natural world and \u2013 consequently \u2013 people."

There is, however, still a lot to do and we will need to make step changes in the pace of action if we are to meet our national\u00a0environmental\u00a0goals.\u00a0I am looking forward to\u00a0continuing to work with the Natural England team and our many partners as we strive to do better for the natural world that sustains us, and in so doing\u00a0assist with our\u00a0national\u00a0goals for growth, health and security."
