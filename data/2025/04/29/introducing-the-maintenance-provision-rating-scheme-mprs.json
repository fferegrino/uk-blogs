It\u2019s here to help raise the bar for commercial vehicle maintenance, by rating workshops on staff skills and facilities. This way, operators can easily find skilled maintenance providers to keep their vehicles safe to drive \u2013 and hopefully make more informed choices on finding a provider that suits their needs.\u00a0\u00a0"

Whilst there are accreditation schemes within the sector, there are some parts of the country where there aren\u2019t many of those to choose from. Hopefully MPRS will become popular across the sector \u2013 giving operators much richer information.\u00a0\u00a0"
