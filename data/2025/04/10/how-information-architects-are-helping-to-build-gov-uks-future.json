As part of a wide range of work across the Government Digital Service (GDS), this will help to realise the vision set out in the blueprint for a modern digital government. The blueprint paves the way for a future where it takes less time for UK citizens to access public services, and where personalised services will come to users, not the other way round."

            "text": "More than a decade ago, when GOV.UK replaced nearly 2,000 government websites, we used content types. These formed a structural skeleton for online government. Each type represents a reusable, repeatable container with a shared purpose and common characteristics - for example, a press release, travel advice or a guide."

        {
            "text": "This approach has worked well, but as we expand into new channels and optimise for AI, we need more granular chunks of information, rich in metadata. Why? Well, structured content and meaning-rich metadata help to serve relevant, summarised content on platforms such as mobile apps. It also supports outcomes and accuracy when content is used to inform AI-generated responses."

            "text": "As we explained last year in a blog post on Inside GOV.UK, content modelling is one of the main ways we\u2019re doing this. By modelling smaller blocks of information, we are enabling GOV.UK content to be used in places other than traditional web pages in the most efficient way. Think Lego - reassembling to meet different needs."
