CCE played a crucial role in ensuring the success of the programme, helping colleagues navigate their digital migration into DBT and adapt to the changes brought with it. \u00a0\u00a0"

Hopefully this can help others working on future MoGs or large change programmes, and showcases the breadth of work that colleagues across Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) do."

We were in direct contact with colleagues booking to attend sessions to receive their replacement DBT devices. It was fundamental for us to stay connected with these workstreams to ensure they knew when colleagues were scheduled for their migrations. The Device Rollout and PDM workstreams could then ensure the correct personal data migrations were completed and the engineers running the sessions were notified."

We worked with the engineers to arrange one-on-one sessions with colleagues where needed to help those who were particularly anxious or less \u2018tech-savvy\u2019. We also worked with colleagues who used assistive technology or equipment to understand what they required to make sure we were prepared ahead of their sessions. This helped alleviate anxieties and made sure they could continue working effectively through their migration."

These were often static such as PowerPoints or manually sent emails.\u00a0From UR feedback, the programme\u2019s content designer created a Migration Hub. This was a fantastic SharePoint site where colleagues could find all the information and guidance they needed at every stage of their migration journey. This could also be continuously updated and meant guidance was kept current."

        {
            "text": "This resource was hugely improved by carrying out UR with colleagues undergoing their migration. We learnt that they were busy and required simple language which was easy to understand and not too technical. They preferred guidance to be presented in a variety of digestible formats such as pictures or videos. They also wanted to easily find out who to contact for help. These changes proved to be hugely useful for colleagues also using assistive technology. Having to download PowerPoint documents makes it difficult to navigate back to guidance pages and unnecessary images are hard for screen readers to understand."
