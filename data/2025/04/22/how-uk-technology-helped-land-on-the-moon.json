            "text": "Fast forward to 2021, Firefly Aerospace approached Nammo UK in search of an engine capable of landing their Blue Ghost lunar lander on the Moon. Thanks to the development of the HTAE, Nammo UK were well equipped to meet Firefly\u2019s needs, leading to the creation of the LEROS 4-ET (Extended Thrust)."

            "text": "The LEROS 4-ET was designed, manufactured and tested in-house at Nammo\u2019s Westcott (Buckinghamshire) and Dublin sites by their highly skilled team. The engine was tested on site in Nammo UK\u2019s vacuum test facility, a capability made possible through the support of the UK Space Agency\u2019s National Space Propulsion Test Facility. The collaboration between these two sites allows the team to simulate the conditions in space under vacuum."

            "text": "Before doing its final burn, the LEROS 4-ET had to complete a series of other manoeuvres to get to that point. On 9 February 2025 it completed its trans-lunar injection burn, which accelerated Blue Ghost to a velocity sufficient enough to escape Earth\u2019s gravity and enter free space towards the Moon. Approximately 4 days later, the 4-minute-long lunar orbit insertion burn occurred to slow Blue Ghost sufficiently for capture into lunar orbit."

            "text": "The LEROS 4 performed its longest burn on 2 March. This was the descent orbit insertion burn, lasting approximately 550 seconds, that was critical to the successful landing of Blue Ghost, working in conjunction with Firefly\u2019s 200 Newton engines on the perimeter of the spacecraft."

There are more exciting things to come, as ESA\u2019s Envision mission to Venus will be powered by the HTAE that will be qualified for flight using the Facility."
