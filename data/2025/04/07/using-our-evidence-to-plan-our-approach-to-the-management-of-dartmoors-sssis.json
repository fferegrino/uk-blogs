As an evidence-led organisation, we use this to inform our advice to farmers and stakeholders on Dartmoor. Our job is to take the best available evidence and apply it within the local context. This is needed to provide the best possible outcome for nature and for the people who work, live and visit Dartmoor.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our recent full surveys show there is much more work to be done to improve the condition of Dartmoor\u2019s SSSIs. All SSSIs across Dartmoor remain in unfavourable condition. For many areas grazing patterns are a factor. This includes both under grazing and over grazing. Any successful long-term plan to recover habitats will mean that grazing regimes will have to adapt. The type, numbers, timing and location of grazing animals are key. But we also know that this is very difficult to achieve in practice, given the huge extent of the unenclosed moorland commons.\u00a0"

            "text": "Our review of the evidence concludes that causes of unfavourable condition on Dartmoor are multifaceted. Contributing factors include over and under-grazing of livestock (e.g. early summer hardy cattle), excessive burning, peat cutting and drainage. The role of external factors such as nitrogen deposition and climate change are not well evidenced on Dartmoor but should not be ignored in management decisions.\u202f\u00a0"

            "text": "The approach to recovering Dartmoor\u2019s SSSIs needs to take account of all these factors \u2013 focussing on one issue such as over-grazing will not work. In fact, applying strict limits to grazing across Dartmoor may jeopardise the very farming systems needed. These farming systems are part of the recovery of the mosaic habitats that make Dartmoor a special place for nature. How to control vegetation management across large, complex and unfenced areas is still poorly understood.\u00a0\u00a0"

Achieving a level of control on Dartmoor\u2019s unfenced moorland for sustained improvement in condition is difficult. Even if this level of control could be achieved, we would need to account for the other factors. This all leads to our conclusions that a more holistic approach is needed. This approach must ensure we can sustain a long-term sustainable management regime \u2013 meaning it must be compatible with viable farm businesses. This of course, is in line with the aims of the Dartmoor Land Use Management Group. The success of this group is vital for nature recovery on Dartmoor.\u00a0\u00a0"

The Southwest Peatland Partnership has pioneered the restoration of extensive areas of peatland habitats. There are also three Landscape Recovery pilots that present an exciting opportunity to deliver the desired long-term and creative management. As well as this, the Protected Landscapes Targets and Outcomes Framework point to a step change in Government\u2019s aspirations for our most cherished landscapes.\u00a0\u00a0"

This will prioritise the protection and enhancement of irreplaceable peatland to prevent deterioration to heathland through targeted management and more regular monitoring. This will also bridge the gap to a time when there is more clarity on Environmental Land Management Schemes (ELMS) to support farmers when making the right choice for their businesses and for nature.\u00a0"
