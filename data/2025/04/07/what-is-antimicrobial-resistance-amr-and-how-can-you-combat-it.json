It might sound like the plot for a dystopian film, but this scenario is real and it's happening now. Antimicrobial resistance, known as AMR, is stopping antibiotics from being as effective as they used to be. There were an estimated 66,730 serious antibiotic-resistant infections in 2023, a rise compared to 62,314 that we saw in 2019, before the pandemic."
