Building on the success of the NIHR\u2019s existing ESGs, these groups will provide specialist academic input to help the UK NSC make robust evidence-based recommendations to ministers."

It only recommends screening if good quality evidence indicates it does more good than harm and represents value for money."

These will include concise evidence maps, which help determine if there is enough published evidence to justify more detailed work, and full modelling exercises that evaluate the overall effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening programmes in all their complexity. The new groups are also well placed to contribute to the continuous improvement of the committee's approach to the evaluation of the evidence."
