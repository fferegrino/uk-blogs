Alongside this, following a previous consultation, the government has been developing a package of reforms to help streamline the process and make it more effective. The outcome of this consultation has been published today (27 February), setting out how we\u2019ll work with the sector to put these reforms into action. Through user research and during the consultation we heard that LPAs are looking for clearer guidance, consistency and more practical tools to speed up plan-making. That\u2019s why today we\u2019re launching a new dedicated home for plan-making resources on GOV.UK.\u00a0"

Plans often end up as long, inaccessible PDFs \u2013 running to 300 pages or more \u2013 which make them hard to read, navigate and engage with for both professionals and the public.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
