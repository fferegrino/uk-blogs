This includes the ability for users issuing bulk claims to use the digital Online Civil Money Claims Service, the journey for damages claims, higher value claims, and multi-party claims involving unrepresented parties, and some of the supporting features like ability to bulk scan forms submitted on paper."

This helps more people settle disputes without going to a full hearing. We expanded HMCTS\u2019 Small Claims Mediation Service - hiring more mediators, adding administrative staff and improving the booking system. Most users are given a mediation appointment within four weeks. We have seen a record number of cases referred to mediation and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with users welcoming a quicker, lower-cost alternative to court."
