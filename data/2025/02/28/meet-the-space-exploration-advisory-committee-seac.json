He is a Professor of Biophysics in the School of Pharmacy, and Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Knowledge Exchange of the Faculty of Science. His research developed an understanding of the mechanical properties of proteins and has led to global collaborations in the areas of single molecule biophysics and molecular evolution. His interdisciplinary research encompasses the application of experimental techniques linked to computational analysis and simulation, and theory. Examples of his research include developing on-site, on-demand manufacture of medicines, studying the role of force in haemostasis and adaptation that links to the effects and consequences of spaceflight and in altered environments, and the changes in mechanical properties of muscle in spaceflight. In 2018, he established the world\u2019s first PhD cohort training programme in Astropharmacy; a subject that he also teaches to Pharmaceutical Science undergraduates."

UCL, 2. the Research Complex at Harwell, where the UK\u2019s Synchrotron, Neutron and Laser sources are located; and 3. ESRF, the European Synchrotron in Grenoble France. His research focusses on the computational simulation and X-ray imaging of materials at a microstructural level. He was one of the pioneers of multi-scale and through process modelling (now termed ICME), working at Alcan on the prediction of defects in light alloy components for companies such as Ford and Rolls-Royce. Peter is an avid experimentalist, developing nano-precision rigs that replicate the processing and service performance of materials on synchrotron beamlines, enabling us to see inside materials in 3D as they change in time. He has developed a series of additive manufacturing machines (both powder bed and Directed Energy Deposition blown powder) that work on synchrotron beamlines at Diamond Light Source, ESRF and APS. His work is revealing how microstructures evolve in processes ranging from additive manufacturing, volcanic eruptions and microstructures within the human body. His experimental techniques and open-source codes have been exploited internationally by aerospace, automotive, energy and biomedical companies to solve key engineering challenges \u2013 from developing additive manufactured human joint replacements to aerospace components."
