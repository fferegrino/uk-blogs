Another common misconception is that some people believe providing a plain text version of the original document fulfils the obligations of authors or content creators to deliver accessible content. Additionally, some think that authors or content creators only have to provide accessible content if a request is made or if there is a disabled person in the audience."

The Excel course is still in development and is expected to launch in Autumn 2025. The good news is there is no need for an alternative accessible version; these courses are designed to be universally accessible for everyone and specific instructions are provided in multiple ways such as Mouse, Keyboard and Voice."

The aim of the manual checklist is to scan for concerns that the automated tools cannot find, such as keyboard navigation and checking that errors make sense.
