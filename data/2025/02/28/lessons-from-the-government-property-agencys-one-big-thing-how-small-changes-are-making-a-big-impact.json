At the Government Property Agency (GPA), that's exactly what\u2019s been happening. As part of the Civil Service\u2019s One Big Thing (OBT) initiative, we\u2019ve embraced the power of small changes to help unlock our innovation potential, empower teams, and challenge current ways of working."

Since then, our teams have been exploring simple, impactful changes they can make to their day to day work. No formal sign off required, no need to ask permission \u2014 just pick an idea, try it, learn from it, and share the results. It\u2019s about removing barriers and creating a culture where it\u2019s okay to fail, as long as we\u2019re learning."

Some of the most impactful suggestions, like shorter meetings or shadowing opportunities scored most highly with colleagues."

            "text": "One key takeaway was that small changes are easiest to embed when they become part of existing team routines. Some teams found it helped by breaking their One Small Change into smaller chunks, adding it as a standing agenda in team meetings, and even incorporating it into away day activities. By weaving OBT into what teams were already doing, rather than treating it as an extra task helped make this easier for colleagues to take part in.\u00a0"
