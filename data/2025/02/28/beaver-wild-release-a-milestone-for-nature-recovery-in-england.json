The beaver\u2019s ability to transform and revitalise our degraded landscape is extraordinary.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is based on the extensive research and experience that we and our partners have been able to acquire through a careful, rigorous approach to beaver reintroduction over the last twenty years. It has been a long journey to this point, during which we have helped to provide\u00a0 feasibility studies, evidence, advice and recommendations to government in 2021, as well as successfully introducing a protection and licensing regime. We are proud of the work that has brought us to a very important new chapter for beavers and the natural world in this country.\u00a0"

Included in the announcement is information regarding licensing the wild release of beavers, managing the existing wild beaver populations, and developing a long-term management plan for beavers in England. Natural England can now issue licences to projects wanting to reintroduce beavers into the wild, where these projects demonstrate clear benefits and where risks can be avoided, mitigated or managed.\u00a0"

The project was assessed against beaver wild release criteria which have been developed through extensive engagement with stakeholders, in particular with the Environment Agency staff in our integrated project team.\u202f\u00a0"

We have also trained 400 people in managing beavers, and they can register for one of the class licences that have been designed to enable rapid and proportionate responses to potential challenges.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

We are therefore transitioning to a position where further enclosures will only be permitted in specific circumstances and more information on this will be shared in due course. We have run a series of workshops in January 2025 to help improve the monitoring and management of enclosed beavers. There will now be opportunities for beaver families or offspring from existing enclosures to be released into the wild as part of release projects.\u00a0Any proposal to remove enclosure fences and integrate beaver families into an existing wild population or new wild release project must first secure a beaver wild release licence, and in the first instance enclosure owners should speak to their local beaver management group or wild release project team.\u00a0"
