This means we can recruit an existing DBT colleague to cover the position for a fixed term at the same grade (level transfer) or as a temporary promotion. At the end of the EOI term, the position needs to be re-opened so that anyone inside and outside the department can apply.\u00a0"

It allows us to solve the short-term problem of covering a role in a more streamlined way than a lengthy recruitment process. It can also be a unique opportunity for the successful EOI candidate. They can try something different for a period of time and either bring the experience back to their previous role, or \u201ctake a shot\u201d at making the change permanent.\u00a0\u00a0"

At the end of 2023, our Data Analysis and Data Science teams had grown so that each would need a dedicated Head of Profession.\u00a0 This created the need for a Head of Data Analysis. At the time I had become increasingly involved in activities that were less technical and more leadership-oriented, so I applied to the EOI, with very few expectations. On my first day of work in January 2024, our Chief Data Officer told me that I had been successful and that we\u2019d be enacting my transition as soon as possible.\u00a0"

In 2 intense weeks I worked with my very patient colleagues to hand over the projects I had been leading and say my (temporary) goodbyes. At the same time, I got introduced to the team I\u2019d be managing and started learning about the details of their work and its context. I had to very quickly shift from writing code and analysing data, to helping my new team navigate some of their current challenges.\u00a0\u00a0"

They support Data Workspace (our platform for holding, governing, and analysing data) by helping others onboard new data sources to the platform. They also assist DBT staff in using Data Workspace tools to interrogate and manipulate data (like SQL, and the Python and R programming languages, or AWS QuickSight for creating data dashboards)."

The data analysts can work embedded in other teams to deliver pieces of work (like monitoring and reporting capabilities). They upskill colleagues so they can look after analytical products like dashboards once the data analysts step away. The work of the data analysts is thus varied and critical to the success of Data Workspace. It combines technical specialism with communication and stakeholder engagement skills.\u00a0"

This meant that Data Workspace, originally created by the former Department for International Trade, saw a sudden increase in the number of potential users, data and analytical assets. We had to help users migrate and learn about the new platform, as well as support analytically other activities related to the establishment of DBT. This added to the team\u2019s existing workload, which created stress for team members and risked making our backlog unmanageable.\u00a0"

At one point, the team doubled in size, which gave us the impetus to bring our backlog under control. Once we were confident that we\u2019d made the position of the team sustainable, we scaled back our resources to ensure best use of money.\u00a0"

Finally, we removed data analysts from the front-line.

This also created the opportunity for our data analysts to invest in their technical development. For example, they picked up tasks that required coding, or more sophisticated approaches to analysing data. "

For instance: I contributed to a new data strategy for the department and coordinated an away day for all the data professions and portfolios. I also led a cross-government effort to improve the job description of data analysts in DDaT. Being given the opportunity to step so far outside my comfort zone is an invaluable feature of the EOI process. It also speaks to the quality of our leadership in DDaT. They are open to giving their staff a chance to grow and give them autonomy and trust to take on new responsibilities.\u00a0"
