UBS is a concept that has been developed by academics at the UCL Institute for Global Prosperity (IGP), which articulates a radical redesign of the welfare state. It sets out how a network of 7 kinds of public services (healthcare, education, legal and democracy, shelter, food, transport and information) could comprehensively meet people\u2019s basic needs, enable them to thrive, and support social resilience in the 21st century.\u00a0"

At the beginning of 2024, our team had the opportunity to continue developing Camden\u2019s thinking on what UBS could look like at a local level, by running a series of co-design workshops."

We recognise we\u2019re lucky that at Camden we have a mandate from our leadership to design projects that help move us towards the \u2018third horizon\u2019 of public services - work that helps us understand, tackle and transform around some of the big issues of our society, such as housing or care. The \u2018third horizon\u2019 framework, developed by the International Futures Forum, helps us think through how we can design services that demonstrate the possibilities of a future system (our third horizon) alongside the \u2018business as usual\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0"

Working in a mission-led way inherently invites us to design with our eyes on the horizon and build capacity within our organisation to work with a \u2018test and learn\u2019 mindset. Going forward, we\u2019re looking to scale up our testing so we can start prototyping what elements of UBS might look like in the real world through small pilots that will give us and others interested in exploring this idea with us a good roadmap for how we can begin to make this tangible.\u00a0"

Though we worked to build psychological safety through co-creating \u2018ground rules\u2019 for how we\u2019d show up together, and compensated them for their time, we still had to navigate the tensions of doing this work as representatives of Camden Council.\u00a0"

Part of our role was in knowing how to hold the tension between recognising we need to fix things now, but also to begin creating something that will work for future generations."

They argued that whilst many designers come from the private sector where work can be delivered in fast-spaced \u201csprints\u201d - design in the public sector is tied to policy, funding cycles and parliamentary terms, which hugely slows things down. Generations of designers will pass down their work and ideas in an \u201cultramarathon baton relay\u201d in the hope that the time will be right for ideas to make an impact. This really spoke to our work on UBS and the way we had to navigate engaging residents in this process. The hope is that the work we do now to shape a vision will have an impact when the right conditions are in place."

Although it may sometimes feel like an \u201cultramarathon,\u201d employing design thinking in government spaces feels so much more meaningful when you know you\u2019re not alone. The value of sharing at and attending conferences like these shouldn\u2019t be understated.\u00a0"
