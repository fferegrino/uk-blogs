To move forward and make sure people could access these benefits as soon as possible, we asked councils to come forward and express their interest in being part of our Devolution Priority Programme \u2013 a fast-tracked programme to mayoral devolution with a view to new Mayoral authorities being in place in May 2026.\u00a0\u00a0This week, the government announced the six new areas that will join the Devolution Priority Programme \u2013 with Mayors to be elected in May 2026 \u2013 the largest single package of mayoral devolution in England.\u00a0"

Ministers have been very clear that the bar for postponing any 2025 elections was set very high \u2013 and would only be permitted if it would clearly help deliver both reorganisation and devolution to the most ambitious timeframe \u2013 unlocking the opportunities these will bring for local people.\u00a0"

The remaining 9 will be delayed until May 2026.

Between 2019 and 2022, the then government legislated to postpone 17 local council elections for one year during preparatory local government reorganisation work.

Previously, it has taken years to achieve both reorganisation and devolution with a number of areas not having yet achieved both - for example in both Somerset and Cumbria it took nearly three years (31 months) for the formation of new unitary authorities, with neither area yet gaining full devolution. We want to see areas on the priority programme move to full mayoral devolution to a much more ambitious timetable \u2013 with 15 months between now and these areas achieving Mayoral devolution.\u00a0"
