            "text": "Many people think apprenticeships are just for young people but that is not true. I have just completed an HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) service and maintenance apprenticeship, which was the perfect opportunity to learn a new, in-demand skill in an industry I have an interest in and set myself on a rewarding career path with the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency."

            "text": "The idea of changing careers and completing a technical apprenticeship was very daunting, but I found that completing an apprenticeship in my 30s came with some major benefits. I had already developed a good work ethic, strong time management and I knew where I wanted to take my career. This allowed me to focus on developing new knowledge of how HGVs function and to hone my problem-solving skills."

        },
        {
            "text": "Earning while learning: Due to my ongoing commitments, I would not have been able to leave my previous role and do education full time. Doing an apprenticeship allowed me to gain new knowledge through a blended approach, with weeks spent at college as well as gaining hands-on experience whilst working in my workshop placement, all whilst earning."

            "text": "High demand and job security: The transport industry is an important aspect of the economy. By completing my apprenticeship with the DVSA, I have gained job security along with fantastic career progression."

        {
            "text": "Variety and challenge: No two days were the same. I went from diagnosing and repairing complex mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic systems on a variety of vehicles, to spending time in college, or attending factory tours to gain a better understanding of the wider industry. This is a career that will keep me engaged and constantly learning."
        },
        {
            "text": "My age was an asset: My life experience outside the workshop proved to be a significant advantage, demonstrating the ability to build relationships with a variety of people, as well as my continued professionalism and my willingness to learn. The opportunity to learn with others in a similar situation to me made the apprenticeship much more enjoyable. The ages of those I worked with ranged from twenty-five through to forty plus and this enabled a wide range of experiences to be shared."
        },
        {
            "text": "Overall, if you're looking for a challenging, rewarding, and secure career, maybe you should consider a technical apprenticeship, don't let age hold you back. Completing my HGV mechanic apprenticeship offered me a fantastic opportunity to retrain, develop new skills, and build a brighter future. It's never too late to make a change."
