        },
        {
            "text": "Many teams work within this programme, but the Launchpad product delivery team works to create a modern and intuitive digital platform that can be used to offer information, rehabilitation content and distraction to empower prisoners on the inside, to live better lives on the outside. The first iteration of this was the Content Hub and Virtual Campus 2 on the laptops. Now we are progressing to bigger things."
        },
        {
            "text": "To do that, we needed to build a more mature home page and single sign-in to allow for more complex future builds and the right level of software access. In effect, we needed to futureproof the in-cell tech platform in order to build more progressively on it."

            "text": "Prisoners only need to sign in once to their laptops, with the password they currently use, in order to be able to access personalised content on every service in the future developed by digital or 3rd party suppliers. Launchpad Auth provides both authentication which allows prisoners to access services, and also authorisation which ensures that prisoners and services only have the permissions relevant to them."

        {
            "text": "But services that provide personalised content need to identify the prisoner.We also wanted to reuse existing capabilities as much as we could, hide the complexities of existing systems, and not give prisoners another set of usernames and passwords. So the Launchpad team realised it would be cheaper and easier to custom-build the solution. Which we did."

Teams that build software services for use outside of prisons or on staff systems can be tested quickly and regularly, but ours takes much longer. We learned patience and to take strong, small steps."

We also worked closely with Tech Ops to carry out an internal application security test."
