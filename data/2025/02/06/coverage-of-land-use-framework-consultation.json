            "text": "There is nothing in our analysis which suggests entire farms will be forced to change their land use. In many cases, land use change will make farms more profitable by diversifying their income streams and more resilient to increasingly extreme weather such as flooding and drought."

            "text": "But the Government will not dictate to anyone how to use their land; the consultation has started a national conversation on land use and will seek the views of businesses, farmers and landowners to determine how England\u2019s land can be used for the benefit of people and nature. It will be for individual business and landowners to make informed choices about their land using the most sophisticated land use data ever published."
