The aim of SbD is to reduce the cyber risks across MOD as well as promoting a \u2018one team\u2019 approach to cyber-security. This enables and empowers everyone to deliver and maintain capabilities that are resilient from cyber-attacks. To achieve this, we have introduced new policies, a new tool and guidance on how to apply the new approach."

This is now the go-to place for all Secure by Design guidance material, and replaces the previous guidance hosted on Defence Gateway."
