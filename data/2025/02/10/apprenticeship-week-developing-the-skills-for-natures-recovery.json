In my case, reading lecture topics that have a focus on riparian ecology and wetland restoration feeds into my role within the nutrient mitigation team, allowing me to understand the waterways we aim to protect and their associated ecosystems. This allows me to contribute to discussions within the team and have a greater understanding of associated legislation that impacts the way we do our jobs."
