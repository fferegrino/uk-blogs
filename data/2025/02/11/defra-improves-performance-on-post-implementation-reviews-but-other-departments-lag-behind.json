            "text": "Given the importance of ensuring that regulations do not impose unnecessary costs on business and provide a barrier to growth, for regulation with significant impacts, it is generally a statutory requirement for departments to undertake a Post Implementation Review (PIR) of the regulation within 5 years of it coming onto force."
        },
        {
            "text": "However, despite this statutory requirement, departments are generally not very good at completing PIRs on time (or indeed at all). Less than 40% of regulations have a PIR by the required deadline as we have repeatedly commented."

            "text": "In March 2023, the Office of Environmental Protection (OEP) published a report highlighting government\u2019s failure to publish at least 80 PIRs related to environmental measures. They singled out Defra as having a backlog of 56 PIRs. In response to the report, the then Defra Secretary of State, Therese Coffey made a commitment in Parliament to address the backlog by the end of 2024."

We commend Defra for tackling the backlog and for now undertaking PIRs in a more timely manner."

            "text": "We also note that, like Defra, DHSC and DfT are being proactive in identifying and undertaking PIRs. However, despite these improvements, we have yet to see a significant increase in the number PIRs from other departments. Since the start of 2024, only 30 PIRs were submitted to the RPC for scrutiny, compared to 140 IAs and OAs."

            "text": "To increase the transparency of the PIR process, and identify where PIRs have not been completed by the required deadline, from April we will start publishing a list of regulations without a required PIR. We welcome comments on this initiative and hope that it will increase the number of PIRs that are completed on time."
