Further afield, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports that it's 24% in the United States and 17% in the European Union. "

Part of what I do is to talk about my career journey, as well as my love of science and maths. I want STEM to be as exciting for the pupils as it is for me, and for them to see themselves as future scientists, despite barriers they may face."

And, above all, that it is important to work as a team as we are all unique and all opinions count.I explain to the pupils how diverse and inclusive teams contribute to innovation, climate resilience and wider sustainability."

Since I was a very young kid, I loved anything numerical and resolving formula and equations. I dreamt of going to university and using my skills to help protect the environment. I was lucky to get the support I needed not just to go to university but also to move to the UK, where I completed an Environmental Science BSc at the University of Southwest England in 2006. Despite it being the 2000s, there were only four women in my class of around 24."

I can recall once being told by a colleague from a different team that I don\u2019t look like a scientist \u2013 that I look too good and too stylish to be a scientist. I was a bit offended, and a bit in shock. Do scientists have \u2018a look\u2019?"
