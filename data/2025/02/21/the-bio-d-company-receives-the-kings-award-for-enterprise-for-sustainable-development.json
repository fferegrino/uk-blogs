What could be better?"

Because it is the work that goes on day-to-day across all departments that helped us to secure the award. Sometimes it feels like the small things don\u2019t make much of a difference \u2013 for example charging reusable batteries rather than using disposables, or organising recycling waste \u2013 but all of the little things contribute toward a bigger goal."
