            "text": "My highlights from the course included learning more about the history of screening policy, UK NSC\u2019s robust evidence review processes, and the ethical considerations in screening. As a strong advocator of informed choice, I found the discussions and debates on ethics insightful. I enjoyed learning about how the principles of medical ethics apply to screening and gaining a greater understanding of what can contribute to informed decisions."

            "text": "This experience has strengthened my expertise and interest in considering how the cancer screening community assesses and adopts innovation. For example, this includes the need to know that new screening tests are not just accurate but also that they can be feasibly and effectively embedded into a screening programme, considering the impact across the whole pathway. This has enabled me to contribute further to our thought leadership activities at CRUK relating to multi-cancer tests and surrogate endpoints."
