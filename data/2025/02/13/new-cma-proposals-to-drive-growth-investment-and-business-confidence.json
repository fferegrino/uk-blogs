Given the vast majority of deals the CMA looks at ultimately end in clearance (either unconditionally or with remedies), we must move as quickly as possible to get to the right decisions.

Under the UK\u2019s \u2018voluntary\u2019 system, parties may choose to notify a merger where they think it meets jurisdictional thresholds. But the CMA can also \u2018call in\u2019 deals, and UK law gives us an unusually broad jurisdiction by international standards. This can create uncertainty over whether we will review a particular deal or not."
