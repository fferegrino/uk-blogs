At the start, it's easy to second guess yourself wondering if you have enough knowledge, if you're asking the right questions or if you're ready to take on bigger responsibilities. But I've found that the moments where I\u2019ve felt a little out of my depth have been the moments where I've learned the most.\""

It\u2019s not just about the qualification at the end, but the people you meet, the confidence you build and the experience that help shape your career. So, if you\u2019re considering an apprenticeship, take the leap, you won't regret it!\""
