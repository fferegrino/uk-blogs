            "text": "The Care Certificate standards provide those at the beginning of their career in care with a fundamental basis from which, if chosen, someone can follow a pathway into other formal qualifications. These might include an apprenticeship, and further qualifications in a direct care role or registered nursing programmes across adult nursing, mental health or learning disability."

It is a fantastic way to build essential skills while supporting individuals who draw on care and support to live safely and independently."

Roles might include direct care roles, management roles, registered practitioner in social work, therapy, nurse associate, or registered nurse. Developing clear career pathways for professional carers, with a portfolio of experience and qualifications, creates valuable opportunities for self \u2013improvement, career progression, and promotion within the sector."

The diversity of opportunity is immense, and the satisfaction of working in a positive and collegiate way with colleagues from many disciplines can inspire not just a job but a fulfilling career."
