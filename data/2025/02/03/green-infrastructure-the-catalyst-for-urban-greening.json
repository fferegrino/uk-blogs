It\u2019s well documented that we need to build a more sustainable future, and at the forefront of this movement is the integration of green infrastructure within the pulsating heart of development. Parks, green roofs, rain gardens, and street trees play multiple roles in helping us make our towns and cities fit for the future, for people and for nature. Last August, we mentioned how the GI framework is being used in preparation of GI Strategies in Local Plans and how it was referenced in the consultation on the revisions of the\u202fNational Planning Policy Framework. In these two years, there has been some significant momentum towards building green arteries in our towns and cities, including:\u00a0"
