            "text": "Starting my apprenticeship in Group Finance at 16 years old was a unique experience - especially as I found myself among colleagues who were much older and more experienced. While my friends were heading off to university, I was diving into the world of finance. It could have been overwhelming, but the supportive and welcoming environment made it easy to adapt. I quickly realised that Group Finance wasn\u2019t just about numbers; it was a place where I could learn, grow, and build a meaningful career."

            "text": "The apprenticeship scheme\u2019s structured learning programme provided hands-on experience from day one. It wasn\u2019t just about completing tasks, it was about actively contributing to high-level projects that aligned with my career goals. I started working with the Group Finance senior leadership team early on, learning how to support strategic decision-making and understanding the broader vision of the department."

        {
            "text": "The apprenticeship also gave me the chance to collaborate with external agencies, such as the Government Internal Audit Agency and His Majesty\u2019s Treasury, where I was involved in publishing recommendations and learning about financial governance. These experiences laid a strong foundation for my day-to-day work, as I continue to work closely with senior leaders and contribute to impactful projects with external partners. The practical, real-world learning I gained during my apprenticeship continues to influence my role today and remains an essential part of my career in finance."

            "text": "I currently work in Group Finance, where I focus on counter-fraud initiatives and strategic projects. Beyond professional growth, I\u2019ve built lasting friendships during my time in the department. My colleagues and I have travelled together to places like Spain and Egypt, and outside of work, they\u2019ve become a key part of my life. Every day, I\u2019m thankful for the department, for the connections I've made, and for the chance to work with such a supportive and inspiring team."
