It is viewed as a world-leading process to provide reactor designers with early regulatory scrutiny. Our interaction with designers through GDA helps to support growth and fulfils one of our duties; to support sustainable development. \u00a0GDA can be carried out at a fundamental assessment level or at a detailed assessment level."

Reviewing designs on paper before construction is important but it\u2019s also extremely valuable to visit the design company, talk to engineers and, where possible, see their facilities and any existing operating sites. This provides a great opportunity to build our relationship with the company, develop a deeper understanding of the power station design and enhance the effectiveness of our assessment."
