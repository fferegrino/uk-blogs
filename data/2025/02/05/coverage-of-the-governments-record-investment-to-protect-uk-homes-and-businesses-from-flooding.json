To shore up creaking defences in need of repairs, funding will be reprioritised for investment in much-needed maintenance, benefitting a further 14,500 properties. This means a total of 66,500 properties will benefit from this funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The Express carries an op-ed from Farming Minister Daniel Zeichner, who explains how the new investment programme will also protect farmland which has been badly hit by recent storms, in turn helping to safeguard farm businesses and farmers\u2019 profits.\u00a0"
