Open tocolleagues across the UK public sector, the group provides acollaborative space to explore critical literature, debate emergingissues, and connect with others.As we approach our fifth year, it\u2019s clear that what was asomewhat niche interest is now a mainstream topic. From AI chatbots in the workplace to concerns about algorithmic bias indecision making, discussions once reserved for specialists arenow aired in public. Those of us responsible for delivering publicservices are under increasing pressure to figure out how data-drive tools, including AI, can deliver impact for the public, safelyand responsibly.This reading group offers a chance to step back from day-to-daywork and engage more deeply with the ethical challenges ofdata-driven technologies (including AI), supported by thought-provoking books and the perspectives of colleagues across thepublic sector.So, what\u2019s changing in 2025? And how can you get involved?"

Over the years, we\u2019ve explored booksand articles that challenge assumptions, provide historical contextto emerging tools and systems, and offer fresh perspectives onthe impact of data and AI.Each session is a facilitated discussion where we split intogroups. Attendees can share insights, ask questions, and thinkabout how the material connects to their work. Importantly, it\u2019s notabout arriving at a single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014it\u2019s about building ahabit of critical thinking and reflection in a supportiveenvironment."
