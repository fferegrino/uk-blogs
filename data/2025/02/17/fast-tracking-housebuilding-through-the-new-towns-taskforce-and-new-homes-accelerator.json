We support this by inputting into more than 10,000 proposed developments each year, ensuring new homes are built with adequate flood risk protection, supply of drinking water and sewerage services and also, by remediating and bringing back into use previously developed land.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

This includes supporting the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government with their work on New Towns; the Housing Accelerator Programme and developments in the Oxford to Cambridge Arc. In all three projects we strongly advocate early identification of solutions, particularly to provide drinking water and sewerage for new homes in catchments under particular pressure and steering proposals to areas with fewer flood risks. Our new National Assessment of Flood Risk and National Assessment of Flood Risk Map will further assist planners, developers and decision makers access the information they need to inform their choices about flooding from rivers, sea and surface water. Last week,\u00a0 we welcomed the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement of new funding under the New Homes Accelerator scheme. This will enable the Environment Agency to invest in its capacity, engage early in the process and further improve the efficiency of our planning application approvals.\u00a0\u00a0"
