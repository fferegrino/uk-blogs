There are 2 types of lessons; internal lessons; that's the mechanics of the wargame, how to make it better, how to make it more effective.\u00a0 And then there are external lessons; what do the findings from wargames tell us the bigger picture and that's the bit where I try and concentrate my effort more.\u00a0The difficult part is turning the analysis into a lesson.\u00a0Looking at what else is going on in other operational theatres, in training, in trends and conflicts across the world and then applying the findings from a wargame."

It's not a silver bullet that will fix every problem.\u00a0 It's important to have the ability to show workings, to understand how you got to that decision rather than just blindly trusting computing to come up with the answer. It's like a math exam, most of the marks come from showing your workings to get to the answer.\u00a0In wargaming, there's always going to be the human factor.\u00a0"

I think part of this is an element of education, that people understand that a wargame is not Google, where you can type in any question and an answer will come out. You need to do a lot of research and analysis beforehand to frame the wargame; if you have a bad question, you'll get a bad answer.\u00a0"
