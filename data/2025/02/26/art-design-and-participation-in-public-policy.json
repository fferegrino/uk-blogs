In autumn 2024, Policy Lab collaborated with Demos in a public event to explore this question as part of their Collaborative Democracy Network. Policy Lab has been at the forefront of policy innovation for more than a decade. Our work focuses on improving policy through new methods and by rooting it in people's experiences of government and everyday life. We use varied creative approaches to involve people in the policymaking process. Our growing portfolio of approaches that draw on artistic practice indicates its potential for improving policy, from bringing out human elements in the policy system to making space for and prompting reflection in policymaking.\u00a0"

Alongside an in-person and online audience, we were joined by four people with fascinating and relevant stories, including a local authority Chief Executive, a socially engaged artist, a movement director who leads a citizens\u2019 jury in Cumbria and a participant from that jury. Emerging from the speakers and participants is a strong sense that artistic practices can positively inform how organisations participate with the public. This includes:\u00a0"

At the heart of the project's work is Jury for Joy, a citizens\u2019 jury with 20 participants from across an area of 66 square miles, all selected via sortition (by lottery). The Jury for Joy meet twice a year. Their responsibility is to spend \u00a3100,000 on creating an artistic programme for the year. The jury decides this through a deliberative process - as with any citizens\u2019 jury - but the difference is that creativity and art is foregrounded in the process of deliberation and decision-making.\u00a0"

According to Kieran \u201cthe way in which our thinking is woven within these encounters leads us to deliberate with a sense of our and others\u2019 bodies and imaginations\u201d. In Policy Lab we have previously explored how using different senses can lead to different forms of insight for policy. The Jury for Joy has taken this into a space where multisensory activities support deliberation, the development of a collective identity and cohesive decision-making. Or to quote Clare again,\u00a0"

Over the last ten months they have been working with council staff in a participatory way to gather content for a public artwork titled CLOCK WORK. This piece comprises thirteen wall clocks for the Town Hall that explore the value of time and how we use it. There is one large clock for the entrance hall with twelve statements on it, accompanied by twelve smaller clocks each incorporating a single different statement. Each statement has been provided by Council staff through a series of participatory and sensory sessions, some of which were very short - five minutes - recognising the time pressures on Council staff.\u202f\u00a0"

At Policy Lab our mission is to radically improve policymaking through design, innovation and people-centred approaches. We are celebrating our 10-year anniversary, a period in which we have delivered nearly 300 policy participatory and innovation projects across government and our work is rooted in the lived experience of citizens. Please see our prospectus or contact us at team@policylab.gov.uk if you are interested in collaborating or commissioning us.
