This high-spec drone climbed to over 100 metres above the National Nature Reserve before flying out across the beach, where thousands of grey seal parents and their new-born pups were feeding, sleeping, fighting and playing. From far above their heads, the drone recorded imagery of the seals, documenting one of Britain\u2019s most important colonies at a vital point in their annual cycle. "

But while they are numerous at sites like the Winterton National Nature Reserve, it\u2019s worth remembering that the UK is one of the world hotspots. Around 35% of the global grey seal population is thought to breed on UK coasts, giving us a particular responsibility to protect them. "

One of the great advantages of the drone/AI method, however, is its potential to access areas which humans can\u2019t, giving reliable data even from points along the coast where there are few ground-based observers, or where seal colonies aren\u2019t fully visible from paths and viewing points.\u00a0"

When around seals you should always keep dogs on leads and take any litter home with you. It\u2019s also worth emphasising that no one should fly a drone over seals unless they have specific permission from any relevant authorities and landowners. "
