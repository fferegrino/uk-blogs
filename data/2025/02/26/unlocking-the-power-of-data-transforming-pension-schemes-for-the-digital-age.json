This analogy reflects the immense value and potential that data holds. Just as oil transformed the industries and economies of old, data has done so in the 21st century. However, like oil, data's true value is only realised when it is refined and properly managed."

            "text": "One of the most promising developments in the pension industry is the advent of pensions dashboards. These digital platforms have the potential to revolutionise member engagement, providing a user-friendly interface that simplifies complex information. By offering members a comprehensive view of their pension savings, they can help members understand their financial situation and plan for the future with confidence. For these dashboards to be effective, however, the underlying data must be accurate and up to date."

They will provide members with real-time access to their pension data, encouraging self-cleansing which could potentially lead to cost savings for schemes. However, this shift requires schemes to adapt their operational processes to handle new challenges, such as partial matches and value data requests."
