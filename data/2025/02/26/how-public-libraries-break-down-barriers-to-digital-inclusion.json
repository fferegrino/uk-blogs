Manchester Libraries increase the level of digital inclusion support provided by community groups by working with an informal network of VCSFE organisations. They increase the number of community organisations that embed digital inclusion in their activities by awarding them funding for offering a variety of digital inclusion support such as recruiting a digital champion volunteer or offering digital skills sessions."
