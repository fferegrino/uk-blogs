This includes informing us of changes to your name, address or telephone number, the address where childcare is provided, working hours and the number of children you look after. You also need to contact us regarding any change to the legal entity of your registered body. You can do this by emailing enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk from the email address you have registered with us and giving your URN. You must also let us know about changes to people connected to your childcare. If you are registered on the Early Years Register, the relevant EYFS sets out the full list of changes that you must notify us about. Providers registered on the Childcare Register must follow the relevant Childcare Register requirements."
