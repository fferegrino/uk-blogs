In response to this we made it easier to add additional parties to DRS applications.\u00a0 So for those applying to transfer of whole, a transfer of part, or a transfer of charge, they are now able to add parties such as additional trustee, trustee in partnerships and various other parties. These changes mean you can review and amend the transferor fields until you are confident that all the names in your application match the register and deeds, and that everyone is accounted for. It will also reduce the need for many requisitions for name discrepancies, improving the speed at which we can complete your applications.\u00a0"

We are building these new services using a more up-to-date and \u2018lightweight\u2019 API \u2013 moving from SOAP to REST \u2013 to ensure a better experience for both the technology developers and service users in the future.\u00a0\u00a0"

Customers who use DRS within the portal are informed of potential errors or omissions within their applications, and the new registration service will build on that to create parity for our customers and provide a single service available across both our web channel (DRS) and through our API platform to Business Gateway integrators."
