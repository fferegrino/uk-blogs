It was creating a task list for onboarding with one of our payment providers. The team came together and thought, \"this would be something good for you to work on\", to enable me to get the experience I needed. Before that I'd been doing a mix of front-end and back-end work, but mainly front-end."

            "text": "I had every Friday for my own independent learning, supported by my line manager who knew exactly what I needed to help me. He gave me a few independent tasks, so that I could do work on something I was struggling with, for example Cypress testing. I then used Mountebank, which we use in combination with Cypress. I'd been struggling with those 2 technologies and he got me to make 2 applications; microservices that talk together. Then I was able to work on the task list properly."

As part of a GDS apprenticeship you get to work on a project that has a business need \u2014 something that the team is going to use. And one thing we needed was a button in an internal tool we use called Toolbox that would allow us to reverse refunds."
