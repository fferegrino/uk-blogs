Misconceptions are harmful and allow the virus to spread because it\u2019s damaging to people\u2019s health when they get into the mindset of \u2018this doesn\u2019t affect me, why would I test for it?\u2019."

Some people might experience a short illness after they contract the virus which can present like the flu, but even then symptoms can vary, and it\u2019s easy to shrug off as \u2018just another winter virus\u2019. I didn\u2019t suspect anything; I was just going about my daily life unaware \u2013 which is easy to do when you\u2019re not regularly testing."

When I arrived at the hospital, doctors didn\u2019t know what was happening to my body. Even if I had known, I couldn\u2019t have told them because I was so ill I couldn\u2019t even speak. When the test results came back, the doctors discovered that I had HIV, and were then able to piece things together."

Once the test confirmed my diagnosis, NHS staff were able to provide me with the right treatment and get my health back on track."

            "text": "HIV medication keeps me healthy, so I can live a normal life. The medication I take has now reduced my viral load to an undetectable level. This means the virus is still there, but it has been reduced to such small amounts in my body that it cannot be passed on, including to my husband. You may have heard of the term \u2018Undetectable = Untransmittable\u2019 or \u2018U = U\u2019; this means that people living with HIV, and who are \u2018undetectable\u2019, have a zero risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partners."

            "text": "For me, HIV medication feels like a miraculous thing, but it\u2019s a treatment, not a cure. My road to recovery wasn\u2019t an overnight fix; it was a journey. I continue to take daily medication, and for the past 10 years I\u2019ve had to go to regular appointments to make sure my treatment is working properly, checking that the virus is at low levels, and my immune system is well. Because of the dedication I\u2019ve put into my health, I have been told that I am no longer required to check in with a doctor or have my bloods taken regularly, as I\u2019m the healthiest I have ever been in my HIV journey, which I am over the moon about."

            "text": "HIV continues to carry a lot of stigma, usually because people lack information about it. Being vocal about my HIV positivity online might come across as easy now, but it took me 5 years to tell people I was HIV positive because of that stigma. It was the most afraid I\u2019ve ever been of anything in my life. Outdated beliefs from the past still linger, but the reality of HIV today is completely different."

            "text": "Consistently using condoms is really important, but there are now other highly effective tools we can use to reduce the risk of transmission. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a daily pill that significantly lowers the risk of getting HIV for those at higher risk. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is an emergency medication that can be taken within 72 hours of potential exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. By combining these methods with regular testing and condom use, we can work towards stopping new HIV infections."

            "text": "Normalising the conversation about HIV, and encouraging regular testing helps break down that stigma. We should see sexual health testing as an essential part of self-care, just like eating well, exercising, and looking after our mental health. Knowing your status is about empowerment and taking control. HIV can affect anyone, no matter your gender or sexual orientation. Regular testing leads to earlier diagnosis, allowing people to start effective treatment sooner\u2014protecting their health and preventing transmission."
