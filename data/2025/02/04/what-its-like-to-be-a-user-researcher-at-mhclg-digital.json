The common mantra in user-centred design is that \u2018you are not the user\u2019, and it is the user researcher\u2019s role to gain an understanding of genuine user needs and pain points by speaking with the users directly. This goes a long way to removing assumptions and biases when designing digital products and services.\u00a0"

As a result, a user researcher is able to present validated needs and pain points to their wider team. This encourages the best practice of putting the users front and centre during the design and development phases of new or updated digital tools, products and services.\u00a0\u00a0"

In a multi-local authority case, a guest will have applied to stay with different sponsors in more than one local authority.
