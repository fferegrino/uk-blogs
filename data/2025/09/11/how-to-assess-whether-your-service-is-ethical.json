As designers our job is to make sure our services meet user needs, solve a whole problem, and make sure everyone can use our services. Now that technology is changing the way we live more than ever, it is important that we develop ways of assessing whether we are designing the right technologies in the right ways.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

Point 13 of the Service Standard, use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns encourages us to look beyond government for things that are tried and tested that we can re-use and therefore not duplicate work.\u00a0\u00a0"

Instead of open-ended questions, it starts with predefined risks and asks teams to explore how their service might lead to them.
