We\u2019re decommissioning UK Air and designing and developing services that are more accessible and which meet user needs. This is important work born out of the tragic death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death."

High temperatures, especially during heat waves, can contribute to increased ground-level ozone and particulate matter. In powering our services, we create emissions and we worsen the quality of our air. While it\u2019s fortunate to be working on a service with direct implications to climate change, it makes the mission of designing a sustainable service no easier or straightforward."

I\u2019ve seen brilliant examples of AI being used to support farmers to find the right funding, understand eligibility, and navigate regulations all while reducing the total environmental impact of the service. I\u2019ve also learned more about the \u2018minimise compute' philosophy which aims to aggressively mitigate carbon emissions by treating compute as a privilege, not a right and I\u2019ve been privy to attempts to incorporate sustainability into the service standard."

            "text": "Hosting and processing are areas in the delivery of digital services with a large environmental impact that teams should seek to reduce. But doing this can feel hard and disempowering as it is largely left up to the companies we commission to store, process and expose data to allow users to use it in the way they need. These entities often obfuscate metrics and collaborating openly remains challenging. Good examples from the likes of GOV.UK (e.g. One Login: Advancing digital sustainability in government case study) highlight the collective effort and time taken to baseline sustainability metrics but demonstrates the huge gains from using a baseline to pinpoint areas of service optimisation that can really drive digital sustainability gains as well as improve efficiency and save money."

Understanding what stage your service is at in its contract can help make delivery more sustainable. At Defra, social value and sustainability metrics are included in the evaluation of new suppliers. Suppliers need to demonstrate how they will reduce carbon in their design and delivery and also adapt their delivery to address emerging climate risks. Suppliers are required to ensure their responses were tailored to the service in question and it\u2019s brilliant that adaptation is a metric at all! Our team have designed contracts to broaden the applicant pool and enable a diverse range of bidders, which I believe will have a positive impact on sustainability reporting."

            "text": "Considering sustainability is a long term, ever weaving exploration, we should prioritise work to embed it. With a new budget cycle in mind, we worked to ensure sustainability was a written line in that budget. The number isn\u2019t huge, and at the moment it's ambiguous as to what it will be spent doing, but it\u2019s there, protected and allocated. Convincing budget holders to keep sustainability as a line even when under financial pressure felt like a big win."

Ask them where there are opportunities to influence design for a more positive environmental impact. At Defra we have a wonderful digital sustainability team who conduct sustainability assessments of services. It\u2019s necessary for all of us to learn from others who have way more technical expertise and experience navigating the entrails of government."

This isn\u2019t about coming with answers but about asking questions. Importantly these meetings allow me to talk to the team about sustainability and encourage them to come along on the journey. If it\u2019s a product manager's role to take a direction and bring a concept to life, we need to inspire people to care and consider sustainability in their role and work."
