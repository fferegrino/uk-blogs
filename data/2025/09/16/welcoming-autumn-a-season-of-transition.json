            "text": "Most broadleaf trees are deciduous, though there are some exceptions such as holly, which is an evergreen that keeps its glossy, spiky leaves year-round. Conifers on the other hand, tend to be evergreen, with exceptions such as European larch which are deciduous and will shed their needles each year."

            "text": "The broad leaves that captured summer sunshine so efficiently are now becoming liabilities. In freezing temperatures, these large leaf surfaces would lose precious water and risk cellular damage from colder weather."

        {
            "text": "Deciduous trees have already begun forming abscission layers \u2013 specialised barriers at the base of each leaf stem that gradually restrict the flow of nutrients and water. As autumn progresses, this layer will produce enzymes that methodically break down the cell walls that anchor each leaf to its branch. Eventually, even a gentle breeze will be enough to send the leaf spiralling towards the ground."

        {
            "text": "Without leaves, trees can enter dormancy to dramatically conserve their energy. They retain moisture within their woody tissues to prevent dehydration, whilst their bare branches offer less resistance to winter winds and reduce the burden of snow settling on them.\u00a0These clever adaptations allow trees to weather the colder months ahead with minimal stress, conserving their resources for spring's eventual return."

            "text": "Scots pine needles may begin showing a subtly different blue-green colouration as they develop natural antifreeze compounds. Norway spruce branches will start adjusting their angle, preparing to shed heavy snow loads more effectively. This helps to prevent branches from snapping under excessive weight, and the downward slope also helps deflect harsh winds."
        },
        {
            "text": "By late October, conifer growth virtually ceases as trees redirect their energy towards survival rather than growth. The vulnerable bright green summer growth darkens and hardens to withstand freezing temperatures. Several species will also develop thicker waxy coatings on their needles to prevent water loss, as the frozen soil in winter makes water uptake more difficult."

        {
            "text": "Autumn also brings more visible changes in conifers, as mature cones begin opening up on warm days to release their seeds. You might notice the contrast between this year's small green cones and the larger brown cones from previous years finally splitting apart. Meanwhile, new cone buds are already forming for next year's cycle!"

        {
            "text": "During the autumn and winter months, trees naturally redirect their energy from leaf and shoot production towards root development. This makes it the optimal time to plant trees. The seasonal shift makes newly planted saplings far more likely to survive, as they can focus entirely on establishing robust root systems without the demanding task of supporting active foliage."
        },
        {
            "text": "The cooler, wetter conditions typical of these months provide ideal establishment conditions. Increased rainfall delivers consistent moisture without the risk of summer drought stress, whilst lower temperatures reduce water loss through transpiration. Dormant trees also experience considerably less transplant shock compared to those moved during the growing season, as they're not actively producing new shoots and leaves that would place immediate demands on a disturbed root system."

            "text": "The arrival of autumn marks the beginning of intense activity for woodland wildlife too as they prepare for winter alongside the trees. The year's collective seed and fruit production across the woodland is now reaching its peak; with hazelnuts, acorns, beechnuts and berries becoming increasingly abundant. This autumn bounty will drive much of the wildlife behaviour you'll observe over the coming weeks, from squirrels frantically collecting nuts to birds like jays taking acorns for their winter stores."

        {
            "text": "These interactions benefit trees as much as animals. The Eurasian jay is considered by some to be the most important factor in oak dispersal and spread, as they store thousands of acorns each autumn yet fail to retrieve many of them.[1] Meanwhile, berry-eating birds like thrushes and blackbirds consume fruits whole, dispersing viable seeds through their droppings across wide areas."

            "text": "As leaves fall and begin to cover the woodland floor over the coming months, they\u2019ll become the foundation of the soil\u2019s underground economy. The leaves provide essential food for an army of decomposers \u2013 earthworms, millipedes, springtails and countless soil bacteria and fungi \u2013 who will work tirelessly to break it all down."

        {
            "text": "Look out for the gradual disappearance of leaf litter through autumn and winter as these active decomposers turn complex plant tissue back into nutrients. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium locked within the fallen leaves will slowly release back into the soil, which creates a nutrient-rich zone around each tree\u2019s root system. These nutrients will be reclaimed by the trees to fuel growth in the spring."
