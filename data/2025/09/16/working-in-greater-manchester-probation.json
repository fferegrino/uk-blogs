His enthusiasm and adaptability saw him progress from operational support to a probation services officer, then fully qualified probation officer. After six years, he moved into his current staff engagement role \u2013 his \u201cabsolute dream job\u201d."

It\u2019s creative, varied and gives me the freedom to try new things. Before this, I spent six years as a probation officer, which was a huge responsibility and a real eye-opener. Making decisions that could impact offender\u2019s lives was daunting but also incredibly rewarding. The journey to get here has been full of opportunities and brilliant colleagues, and I still enjoy coming to work every day."

            "text": "How did you build the confidence to handle decisions about other people\u2019s lives in your role?I quickly realised I wasn\u2019t making decisions alone. We always discussed cases as a team, and my manager was there whenever I needed to talk things through. It was a steep learning curve, but each experience built my confidence and taught me to trust my judgement."

            "text": "When I was a probation officer, the team atmosphere was one of the best parts of the job. You see each other most days and everyone\u2019s ready to step in and help if someone is struggling. That support made a high-pressure environment much more manageable. Even now, with larger teams, the culture of looking out for each other is still strong. We often socialise outside work and that bond carries into the workplace. If you have a tough session with an offender, you can always offload to the team and get advice. You are never really working alone."

            "text": "What does resilience mean to you in probation work?For me, resilience isn\u2019t about bottling things up or just pushing through. Early on, I\u2019d work late and keep going no matter what \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t healthy. Now I see resilience as recognising when you need support and being open about it. Asking for help actually makes it easier to cope in the long run."

        {
            "text": "What skills are essential for a probation officer?Patience and genuine listening are huge. People don\u2019t always express themselves in the way you expect, so you need to give them space and time. Cutting someone off too quickly can shut them down, especially if they\u2019ve rarely been listened to before. It\u2019s about taking the time to respond thoughtfully, even in a fast-paced job."

            "text": "I think people who have worked as teachers or police officers have the closest skills already to what we do. But really, it\u2019s a broad mix. I\u2019ve even worked with a former priest. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019ve done before, as long as you have strong communication skills and life experience. Being able to build relationships is essential. You also need a basic level of IT because the job involves a lot of admin work."
