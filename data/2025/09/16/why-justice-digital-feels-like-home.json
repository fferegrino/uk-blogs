With our values, culture, and community, it\u2019s no wonder we are one of the best places to work in the Civil Service.\u00a0"

            "text": "We know that our strength lies in our differences. Diverse teams bring fresh ideas, challenge assumptions, and help us see problems from new angles. That is why we work hard to make sure everyone has a voice, and that those voices are listened to. Innovation doesn\u2019t happen in echo chambers; it happens when we embrace a range of perspectives.\u00a0"

            "text": "Fairness matters too. Inclusivity is about recognising that people have different needs and making sure those needs are met. Whether it\u2019s flexible working, accessibility, or tailored support, we aim to create a level playing field where everyone has the chance to succeed.\u00a0"

            "text": "In my role as a Social Mobility Ambassador, I\u2019ve seen first-hand how powerful visibility can be. Visiting schools in underrepresented areas and showing young people that there is a place for them in the Civil Service, it\u2019s one of the most rewarding parts of my job. When someone sees themselves reflected in a space, it opens doors.\u00a0"

In justice Digital we also have targeted initiatives like the Women in Engineering Working Group and Women in Digital and Data Forum that aim to increase female representation in technical roles and leadership.\u00a0\u00a0"
