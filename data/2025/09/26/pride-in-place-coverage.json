The piece goes on to quote the Prime Minister\u2019s speech yesterday, announcing the funding, and also carries comments from MHCLG\u2019s Secretary of State and the Chancellor. The paper\u2019s editorial, titled \u2018Streets of Hope\u2019, sets out the announcement isn\u2019t just about \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d but about bringing \u201chope and opportunity\u201d to communities. The Independent takes a closer look at the programme, explaining what it means, highlighting the fact that the money will be given to communities to spend as they see fit for their areas."
