Users will see fewer hand-offs between teams when they need support, a greater focus on their perception of the experience, and we\u2019re introducing commercially incentivised experience level agreements to drive continual improvement."

To put this into perspective - across the EU, 160,000 laptops are thrown away every day. While 80% could be recycled, only 20% are. Each refurbished laptop we use saves approximately 316 kg of carbon reduction, compared to manufacturing a new one. We're proud to be leading positive change in this area."
