But numbers alone don't capture the transformation I've witnessed \u2013 from salmon returning to spawn in Swindale Beck after 150 years to communities that are more resilient to flooding because we've allowed rivers to flow naturally again.\u00a0"

While the extreme flooding caused devastation across Cumbria, our restoration projects proved remarkably resilient, with waters returning to normal levels much faster than in unrestored areas and allowing farming to resume more quickly. This taught us that nature-based solutions deliver benefits far beyond wildlife \u2013 they build climate resilience for the communities we serve.\u00a0"
