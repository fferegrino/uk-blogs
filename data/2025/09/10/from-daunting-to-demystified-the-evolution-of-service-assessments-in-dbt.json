            "text": "When service assessments were first introduced in DBT (formerly the Department for International Trade) in December 2021, they were viewed as a formal requirement \u2013 something to get through, rather than something to learn from. The process was new, the expectations were unclear, and for many teams, the experience felt intimidating. There was a real fear of \u201cfailing\u201d in front of senior stakeholders, especially for complex, policy-led services. Assessments were one-size-fits-all events and perceived as high-stakes."
        },
        {
            "text": "When we first picked up the reins of the service assessment process last year, it felt like we were assembling a plane mid-flight. Teams were unsure how to prepare, what to expect, or even whether the assessment would reflect the realities of their work. Engagement was low because the process was reactive and treated more like a compliance hurdle than a meaningful checkpoint. Assessments were booked late in delivery and teams scrambled to prepare slide decks that tried to tick every box. It was not uncommon for teams to feel like they were being judged, rather than supported."
        },
        {
            "text": "In short, the early days of service assessments were marked by uncertainty and anxiety.\u00a0 There was a sense that the process was something to survive, rather than something to embrace."

            "text": "Fast forward to today, and service assessments feel like a completely different experience. What was once a daunting hurdle has evolved into an adaptive process that supports teams to improve, learn and grow. We have built a culture of continuous improvement that embraces progression over perfection."
        },
        {
            "text": "The new ratings system reflects this shift. Services are no longer given the ratings of \u2018met\u2019,\u2018not met\u2019 or \u2018met with conditions\u2019, but rated either Green (met), Amber (not met, not critical) or Red (not met, critical). The Amber rating allows services to continue delivery while addressing the areas that need improvement. It keeps momentum without compromising standards, highlighting that assessments are no longer just a compliance tick box, but an opportunity to support the direction of travel. This encouraged a more open, constructive and conversational approach, reframing assessments as opportunities for learning, rather than judgement. Assessors are now encouraged to take on a more human approach: bringing empathy, curiosity and a genuine desire to support teams. This allows assessments to feel less like a tribunal and more like a conversation with a critical friend. It focusses on helping services move forward, not catching them out."
        },
        {
            "text": "Early engagement has also been key. By working with service teams right from the outset, we have supported preparation for the assessment through embedded feedback loops. We have introduced assessor focus groups, participated in retros and even introduced a show and tell into our pre-meet calls. All these came from listening and adapting to user needs, reflecting our commitment to improving the process for everyone."

Collaborating on training materials has helped grow our assessor community, with quarterly training for colleagues in both DBT and other departments. This ensures training is streamlined and consistent with GDS\u2019s vision, increasing assessor confidence and building a better-connected community of practice."

            "text": "The Service Standard is now a guiding light from day one, not just a checklist at the end. The results speak for themselves: since September 2024, compliance has increased from 50% to 76%. Our biggest increase is around accessibility and Service Standard 5, where our compliance has grown from 14% to 78%. Some Standards, such as 9 and 11, are now met 100% of the time \u2013 an achievement that felt out of reach a year ago. This is all thanks to the culture we have embedded, sustained by a growing community committed to doing things better, together."

We recognise this, and take a proportionate mindset to assurance, offering flexible options that fit the context. Whether it is a non-transactional service, or a complex service with multiple user journeys, proportionate assurance enables early intervention and course correction without blocking delivery. This helps teams stay on track even under severe time constraints or stakeholder pressure."

        {
            "text": "Our aim is for a mindset that is less of a blocker and more of an enabler. We support teams to set up for success by surfacing risks early, including encouraging Alpha reviews within the first 8 weeks. Even when teams are still shaping their direction, these early assessments can flag issues to senior stakeholders (such as under-resourcing).\u00a0 This enables timely course correction before code is built, and change becomes more complex. We also offer pragmatic solutions such as regular assurance reviews. These are used to maintain alignment with the Standards across multiple structurally similar user journeys, without the burden of repeating full assessments."
