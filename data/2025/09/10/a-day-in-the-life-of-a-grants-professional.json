That\u2019s not just a clich\u00e9, it\u2019s the reality of life in the DSIT Grants Hub, where I work as part of a centralised team of grant specialists in the department\u2019s Commercial function. Our job is to help policy colleagues design and deliver grant schemes that are robust, compliant, and ultimately deliver real value for public money."

            "text": "My role gives me a front-row seat to a wide range of programmes, from Cyber and AI to Regulatory and Health to name just a few. It\u2019s not just the breadth that keeps things interesting, but the depth too. I often find myself deep in the details of grant functional standards such as assessing if a grant is considered a subsidy using the Subsidy Control guidance to diving into eligible funding assessments on grant claims."

            "text": "We offer different levels of support depending on the needs of each scheme. Sometimes that means providing core advice on business case development and award processes.

You get to see the direct link between your work and the outcomes it enables, whether that\u2019s supporting cutting-edge research, helping small businesses grow, or driving forward national priorities. And you do it all while navigating the complexities of public sector governance, which keeps you sharp and grounded."

We need to make sure we're prepared, while also managing team resources efficiently. It\u2019s always encouraging when interest is high, but that also means a last-minute scramble to ensure we have enough assessors in place to manage the workload.\u00a0"

            "text": "I also make sure to get involved early in the design of grant schemes and seek input from experts where needed, such as the Complex Grants Advice Panel (CGAP). Having a clearly defined and consistently followed assessment process helps maintain confidence in our recommendations, especially when significant funding is at stake."

            "text": "Spotting an application that seems too good to be true often comes down to the detail or lack thereof. Vague statements without supporting evidence or a clear rationale for the project's expected outcomes are a major red flag. I also look closely at how the grant will be managed and reported on, particularly around stakeholder engagement or risk management. If there\u2019s ambiguity in those areas, it prompts further scrutiny."
