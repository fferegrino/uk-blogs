It may appear that the user group is highly digitally literate at present, but this is not a certainty, nor will it necessarily be the case for all future users. The service should be designed for those with the most complex needs with regards to literacy, ESL, accessibility. If the service meets the needs of these users, it will meet the needs of the average user\u00a0\nkeep in mind that an individual's self-assessment of their digital literacy is not an accurate measure of their actual ability\nmake use of recruitment approaches beyond agencies, particularly if this route is delaying your research. There was a mention of using charities to recruit individuals with accessibility needs, this can often be a very fruitful approach and would be worth exploring. Ensure that you can show the panel at the beta assessment that you are doing all you can to recruit appropriate participants\n\n"
