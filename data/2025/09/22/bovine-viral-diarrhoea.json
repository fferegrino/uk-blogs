            "text": "Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) presents a major challenge to farmers due to its ability to spread silently through persistently infected animals, causing immunosuppression, reproductive losses, and increased vulnerability to other diseases. These effects lead to significant economic costs from reduced productivity, veterinary expenses, and trade restrictions. Diagnostic complexity and the need for coordinated eradication efforts further complicate control, making BVDV a persistent threat to cattle health and farm sustainability both in the UK and globally. I play a leading role in addressing this disease through my work as Head of the National Reference Laboratory for BVD at the Animal and Plant Health Agency."

            "text": "The NRL for BVD really is a team effort, not only overseeing testing, but also providing advice on BVD-related matters to vets and livestock practitioners. My role involves improving our testing capabilities and helping to fill in knowledge gaps by advancing research to better understand how the virus transmits across different species. I also develop species-specific diagnostic assays, and continuously check that the tests we have are fit for purpose. All this information is shared with colleagues at APHA and our partners."

            "text": "Unlike most viral infections that animals (or humans) can overcome, leading to full recovery, BVDV is unusual as it can cause persistent infection. This means continuous shedding of the virus (the process by which virus particles are released from an infected host into the environment) and greater chances of onward transmission. By identifying and removing these persistently infected animals, we can take an important step towards stopping the spread of this virus and eradicate the disease."
