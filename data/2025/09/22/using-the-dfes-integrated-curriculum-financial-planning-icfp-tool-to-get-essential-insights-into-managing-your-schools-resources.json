            "text": "I first came across ICFP through the free DfE webinars, and I found it really interesting and started testing it. Since joining Campfire Education Trust, we have used it to inform budget setting and to make sure that the expenditure, particularly around staffing, were in line with the metrics."

            "text": "So, I worked closely with them and with the school business managers to implement ICFP, the metrics it provides, and the importance of them in helping make decisions. All of our headteachers are better informed and absolutely on board with it now."

            "text": "The integration is what makes it so powerful. I always emphasise that finance isn't a separate function. You need to understand what's driving the finances in your school, making sure they're linked to the curriculum, the costed school development plans, the whole strategy of where your trust is going.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "At CET, we've just set the next three-year budget forecast and ICFP has been invaluable. Funding is tight, so it's increasingly important to make sure that we're getting the best out of it. We've got to ensure that the children are getting the best education possible and that staffing structures are appropriate."

            "text": "Context is key. All our schools are very different. We have some schools with high levels of deprivation; we have some schools that are PFI schools. There are all sorts of different things to consider. So, we don't compare metrics against each other, but individually we can keep an eye across the whole trust from a consolidated position of where we are but also monitor the individual schools."

        {
            "text": "If there are metrics that throw up things that are outside what would be deemed the usual range for a particular school, it just opens those discussions, to provide the school with a range of options so that we can look at what else we could do to achieve a balanced budget."

        {
            "text": "This forward visibility allows us to avoid possible job reductions through natural staff turnover and strategic planning. Without these metrics, you don't get an early enough warning, making it much harder to address potential issues before they become critical."

            "text": "Alongside the data we get from ICFP, we also use the DfE\u2019s Financial Benchmarking and Insights Tool (FBIT). With this, we can look at what other schools or trusts are spending on certain things to check whether we're in line \u2013 though you need to be wary of whether you\u2019re comparing like for like."

Context is key when using benchmarks and ICFP, and it is therefore essential that the metrics are considered in the light of the individual school\u2019s detailed knowledge of pupils and their complex needs."

The training was first rate, and I now support other schools and trusts in their resource management."
