However, there was no clear agreement on what the threshold levels should be. Many suggested raising the tier 1 ceiling above \u00a3500,000, and some proposed aligning thresholds with audit limits."

In addition, we are aware of jurisdictional differences in audit thresholds, which reinforce the need to avoid conflating the reporting frameworks. The SMB is considering all of the views received in determining the way forward with tiered reporting."

But we also recognise the need for well-signposted support materials that help charities navigate tricky terrain with confidence and we will be looking to work with partners in this space. This is particularly relevant where new or complex accounting treatments are concerned.\u00a0 The more accessible the SORP is, the more confident charities can be in meeting their obligations and telling their stories well."

It\u2019s clear that thoughtful refinements, informed by the consultation, will improve clarity, consistency, user understanding and promote public trust through clear, relevant and proportionate reporting."
