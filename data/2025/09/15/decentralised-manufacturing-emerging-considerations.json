            "text": "Decentralised Manufacturing (DM) is the overarching term used in the UK to cover the two elements of the new manufacturing and supply framework: point of care (POC) and modular manufacturing (MM). A cross-agency team of Quality and Clinical Trial assessors, Safety and Surveillance assessors, Inspectors for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Pharmacovigilance (PV) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) plus scientists from the MHRA Science Campus have worked closely together to support the implementation of the new DM legislation. These teams also come together to help answer a wide range of stakeholder queries which relate to the designation of DM products, applications for or variations to Clinical Trial and Marketing Authorisations, manufacture, licensing requirements and general handling and oversight of medical products."

We have included this blog on both our MedRegs and MHRA Inspectorate blog pages, to share information widely among followers of both blogs."

In the period between this SI being signed into law on 23 January 2025 and it coming into force, regulatory guidance documents were developed through an in-person workshop on 12 March 2025 and further comments received after the workshop. These documents, together with other DM information, have been published on the new Decentralised manufacture hub."

            "text": "This framework provides manufacturers with new alternatives in a broadened range of manufacturing and supply options beyond those in the current factory-based model, i.e. centralised manufacturing. The framework is not only for new products. It also provides an option for existing centrally-manufactured products at clinical trial or authorised, which will benefit from DM, to change based on an appropriately supported and justified variation."

            "text": "However not all products and processes will be suitable for DM. This is primarily a \u2018scale out\u2019 option contrasting with the current \u2018scale up\u2019 model which is typically used for products that have long term stability and are geared for large uniform markets. Centralised manufacture is still the default or baseline manufacturing and supply position. The new legislation introduces new legal tests for the MHRA to assess the justifications submitted for either POC or MM via the designation step described below."
        },
        {
            "text": "Currently DM is only applicable within the United Kingdom (UK) and applicants must have a legal presence in the UK to apply for designation to manufacture DM products here. However, DM frameworks are being introduced in several other territories. For example, the European Union has draft legislation and the USA has the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s FRAME initiative. The MHRA will continue its international engagement to support interoperability of DM frameworks across different territories and to update guidance documents where needed."

Some manufacturing processes may never be suitable for DM and others currently may not be suitable for DM. These decisions are based on considerations such as manufacturing complexity, environmental condition requirements and availability of automation. These are expected to change over time as new technical developments come into operation."

Where centralised manufacture is unsuitable or is restrictive, a justification anchored in clinical benefit must be submitted to the MHRA through the DM designation process. Aspects relating to clinical benefit may be wide-ranging and may incorporate elements of improved clinical outcomes and equity and timeliness of access, such that there are no geographical barriers to accessing innovative medicines in what for some conditions, may be a narrow clinical window of eligibility. In all instances, data or published literature should be presented to support claims around clinical benefit."
