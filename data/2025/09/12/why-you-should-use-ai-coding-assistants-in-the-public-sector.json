They allow developers to focus their time on tasks which require more human oversight and thinking, with previous studies presenting solid evidence to support this, such as the Effects of Generative AI on High-Skilled Work: Evidence from Three Field Experiments with Software Developers."

This is why the Engineering Excellence team at the Government Digital Service (GDS) designed the cross-government AICA trial in order to surface real, measurable metrics that can be applied across the entire public sector and beyond.\u00a0"
