            "text": "The IADC, which is over 30 years old, is a group of 13 Member Space Agencies who perform coordinated research on space debris topics. The research performed by the Committee focuses on a range of topics from developing new approaches to shield spacecraft from natural and human-related debris impacts to forecasting the evolution of space debris environment. The output from this research has guided the development of the Committee\u2019s most well-known product, the IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, which has informed the regulatory approach across the globe on how to mitigate the human impact on the space environment."

The establishment of the Associate Member status in 2024 was intended to encourage interaction with a broader range of Space Agencies, fostering collaboration and raising awareness of the Committee\u2019s research activities and guidelines."
