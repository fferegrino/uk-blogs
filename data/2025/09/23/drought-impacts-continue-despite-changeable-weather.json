However, this spring and summer has been dry and the drought is causing significant environmental impacts, with Atlantic salmon, hedgehogs and garden birds struggling (as reported at the recent National Drought Group)."

There are some positives, with some some increases, albeit very small. For example: Yorkshire Water\u2019s reservoirs stocks are 30.8% (as of 16 September) following a 0.2% increase \u2013 the first rise in levels since January."

A couple of weeks of rain are enough for lawns to turn green and stop trees shedding leaves. For this reason, many people believe that drought is an easily reversible problem, and that a short period of heavy rain is enough to prevent a prolonged drought.\u00a0"

Here at the Environment Agency, we are continuing to respond to the environmental impacts of drought, including rescuing fish in distress and investigating low flows and algal blooms. We are working closely with water companies to ensure they are following their drought plans and working with other abstractors on managing their access to water."
