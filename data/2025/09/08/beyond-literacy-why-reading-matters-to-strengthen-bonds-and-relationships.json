Books offer children a safe space to process emotions, make sense of the world, and see themselves reflected in a way that validates their experiences."

The book we read to a child may be simple \u2013 but it provides the basis for consistent, emotionally rich, co-constructed experiences through a simple ritual accessible to all families. These reading experiences enhance bonding, which is not only important for children, but can also contribute to caregivers\u2019 wellbeing."

The books have increased children\u2019s confidence and emotional expression, and the kits have enabled their families to discover new ways of enjoying time together."
