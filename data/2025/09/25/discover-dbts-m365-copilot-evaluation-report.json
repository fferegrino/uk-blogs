However, the evaluation identified some limitations and the need for training and support to maximise M365 Copilot benefits and mitigate risks. The evaluation findings will feed into a series of internal recommendations and next steps. Further evaluation is being conducted to assess the value for money and environmental impact of M365 Copilot usage in the department."
