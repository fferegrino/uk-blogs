This English anaesthetist's invention transformed anaesthesia from a game of dangerous estimation into a safer, controlled science, making surgery not just survivable but more humane. Dr Clover is regarded as one of the founders of British anaesthesia and is honoured by the Association of Anaesthetists with a biennial lecture.\u00a0"
