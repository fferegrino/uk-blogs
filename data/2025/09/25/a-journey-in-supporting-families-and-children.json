            "text": "Early in my career, I began to deliver Triple P parenting programmes, first through children's centres and then through my own company. I started noticing clear patterns: I observed that many parenting challenges stemmed from experiences of domestic abuse, sometimes ongoing, sometimes historical. I realised we were trying to address parenting when, in fact, the children were communicating with us through their behaviour, which was influenced by the impact of domestic abuse. We were tackling the symptoms rather than the root cause."

Since then, it has been used widely as a training tool for professionals across the sector. My role was to help ensure the film\u2019s message was accurate and impactful. I continue to work across countless organisations and local authorities, supporting them with their response to children affected by domestic abuse through training and consultancy."
