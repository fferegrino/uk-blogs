This challenge is not an insignificant one, given the pace at which science continues to advance and new technologies emerge.In the Government Office for Science\u2019s Emerging Technology team, one of our aims is to strengthen cross-government collaboration on emerging technology. A problem that we identified was that people using different terms for identical, or overlapping, technologies was holding back collaboration. For example, which are the most important technologies out of AI, neural networks or machine learning? This isn\u2019t a question likely to lead to useful insight."

We also hoped it would allow for easier communication of our insights and help us structure our data-led technology assessments. Finally, we thought it would also give us a snapshot of science and technology, which we could regularly update to keep pace with new developments. So what have we done?"

Technologies are organised into a hierarchy, whereby each level goes into more granular detail, but not all technologies at the same level are equal in size or importance."

We hope that a consistent, quality-assured approach to the defining of technologies should lead to better analysis and more rigorous evidence underpinning science and technology policies.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "The Emerging Technology Taxonomy is designed to be a living document that is regularly updated. One of the reasons for this \u2013 and one of the associated challenges with doing so \u2013 is that our understanding of science is constantly developing and new technologies are continually emerging. New technologies don\u2019t neatly evolve from an ancestor. Often, a new technology will be the combination of several innovations. The taxonomy structure is always going to be a judgement we could revisit. For example, does quantum computing sit in quantum technology or future computing? Of course, it\u2019s both. One of the ways in which we ensure our taxonomy keeps pace with new developments is through our horizon scanning function."

We draw on this function to help government anticipate \u201ctechnology surprise\u201d, which we broadly define as a disruptive and unexpected development in science or technology. This can bring challenging domestic and international policy issues, lead to substantial socioeconomic impacts, and present wholly new opportunities or risks for government. There are a range of ways in which technology surprise might occur, be it a major breakthrough in a particular field, a new application or rapid adoption of an existing technology, or a convergence of different technologies to create new possibilities and use cases."
