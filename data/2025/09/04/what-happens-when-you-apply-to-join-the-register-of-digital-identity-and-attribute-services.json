It can take up to 20 working days for your service to appear on the register. That\u2019s because there are important, human-led review processes that take place after your service is certified. Often those processes aren\u2019t visible to providers who\u2019ve applied to join the register, and that leads to one question:"

This process commonly takes around one to two weeks \u2013 though it can be more or less depending on the specifics of your service."
