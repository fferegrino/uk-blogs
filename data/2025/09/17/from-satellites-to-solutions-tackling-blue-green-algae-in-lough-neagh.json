            "text": "Responding to this challenge requires more than traditional monitoring alone. That is why the UK Space Agency, through its Unlocking Space for Government programme, has joined forces with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) and partners in Northern Ireland to explore how space data can be applied directly to this pressing public need."
