Medical attention (rabies post exposure prophylaxis) was not received at the time of the scratch and sadly the patient died after being infected with rabies virus.

In addition, each year, we test around 14,000 pet blood samples to confirm rabies protection after vaccination.

We are collaborating with domestic and global researchers to innovate and enhance rabies vaccine efficacy and applying artificial intelligence for rabies virus detection. In addition, we develop tools to check how well vaccines work (antibody neutralisation detection). For instance, our recent research has focused on engineering rabies viruses to glow under a microscope (express fluorescent proteins), making it quicker and easier to spot protective antibodies. We use bioinformatics for genetic typing of the rabies virus (reading the virus\u2019s genome) to help us understand how, where, and when the virus spreads around the world.\u00a0"
