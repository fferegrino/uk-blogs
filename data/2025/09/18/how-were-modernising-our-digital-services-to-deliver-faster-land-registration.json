            "text": "We've made significant progress in speeding up our services through automation. While speed is our priority, we are also always conscious of the integrity of the register so we are rolling this automation out carefully across different types of application. We've fully automated several types of the simpler applications (e.g. removing a deceased owner\u2019s name from the register) and introduced elements of automation throughout many others. This includes automating 30,000 additional Charge applications in the last financial year.\u00a0\u00a0"

This not only speeds up those applications but also frees up our caseworkers to focus on other, complex applications like First Registrations or leases. This in turn results in much quicker completion times and reduces the overall age of unprocessed applications.\u00a0"

These checks are already completed in our web service, DRS, so this change brings parity to our registration service irrespective of the channel used. This technology quickly catches errors before applications are submitted, preventing delays and requisitions that slow down the process. A full list of what these digital checks will be looking for is covered in our online guidance.\u00a0"
