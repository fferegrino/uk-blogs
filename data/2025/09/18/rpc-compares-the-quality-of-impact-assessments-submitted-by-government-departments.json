As well as the headline \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 rating, we rate IAs across four areas: rationale and options; cost-benefit analysis; wider impacts; and monitoring and evaluation plans. Areas that are rated \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018Satisfactory\u2019 provide good or sufficient support for decision-making on those areas of the assessment, while those rated \u2018Weak\u2019 or \u2019Very Weak\u2019 provide inadequate support for decision-making."

Top performers were the Department for Business & Trade (DBT) and the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS), both having 79% rated as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018satisfactory\u2019; the weakest performers were the Department for Education (DfE) and the Ministry for Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) with only 50% and 48% respectively of their ratings being above the line. This means that we judged over half of the assessed areas for those departments as inadequate to support decision-making."

This means that the department has an opportunity to address the areas of concern and resubmit the IA for a further review."

The department with the highest percentage of initially unsatisfactory IAs was HM Treasury with 60%, while the lowest percentages were DCMS with 13% and \u2018top of the class\u2019, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) with no IRNs at all."
