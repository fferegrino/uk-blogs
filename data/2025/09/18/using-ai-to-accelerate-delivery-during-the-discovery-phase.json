Additionally, tools like Google and OpenAI have limitations on the amount of data they can analyse, making them useful for analysing smaller datasets (around 50 records) but not for large-scale analysis. The classification of documents also had an impact on the tools we used\u2013for most tools only documents classified up to \u2018Official\u2019 could be analysed. When using M365 CoPilot, which is accessed through our Defra laptops, we could analyse documents up to and including \u2018official-sensitive\u2019."
