After all, once people can use their digital ID to buy a bottle of wine, they\u2019ll expect it to have the same purchasing power for things like tobacco and vapes, fireworks or gambling. That\u2019s why we are working across government to promote consistency across in the rules for the sale of other age restricted products.\u00a0\u00a0"

There are also clear benefits to being able to ensure that payments have been authorised by the right person, without that person needing to visit their bank in person.\u00a0\u00a0"

This guidance will provide clarity on the definition of a digital identity and give further detail on how trust framework certified DVS can be used in line with the MLRs\u2019 risk-based approach.
