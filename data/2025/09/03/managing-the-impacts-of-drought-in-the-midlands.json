Drought was declared in the West and East Midlands on 15 July, joining the North-West and Yorkshire which went into drought in June.Dry weather continues to impact water resources across England requiring water companies to take action to manage demand with the public being urged to use water wisely. Across England, rainfall was 20% less than long term average for June. June was also the hottest on record for England, with two heatwaves driving unusually high demand for water."

            "text": "What is the water situation in the Midlands?  In the Midlands, public water supplies are currently secure, but we are seeing adverse effects on the natural environment due to the ongoing lack of rain. And while groundwater levels have been normal across the region, they are starting to fall. Meanwhile, river levels are already low with some river flows in the region at their lowest for June since 1976. For example, the River Severn catchment received only two-thirds of the rainfall it normally does in June, while the Trent catchment fared worse, with only 37% of its long-term average for June. Lack of rain combined with warm temperatures lead to low water levels and less oxygen in rivers and streams \u2013 a stressful situation for the wildlife that depend on them. "

So, what is the Environment Agency in the Midlands doing to achieve this during the current prolonged period of dry weather? We operate water supplement schemes that support rivers \u2013 such as the River Severn Regulation."

As the government body responsible for licensing abstractions in England (taking water from the environment), we encourage farmers and growers to take and use water in a sustainable way. This includes putting temporary limits on abstraction licences and supporting water transfers (where someone with water to spare supplies another abstractor). We also ensure water companies have robust drought plans in place, should they need to activate them (it's your water company who will decide whether or not a hosepipe ban is needed this summer). Find out more about how we are supporting the farming community to manage the impacts of dry weather. "
