For some, it can increase the risk of developing serious lung and airway infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia or can make existing conditions worse. Flu spreads easily and can lead to hospitalisation - in some cases, even death. The flu virus is constantly evolving, which is why getting vaccinated each year is vital.\u00a0"

Women will pass on some immunity to their baby, protecting the child during the early months of their life.

From 1 September 2025, pregnant women can receive the vaccine as the flu vaccine in pregnancy offers the baby some protection in the first few months of life. All eligible children can also receive a vaccination from 1 September as the protection from the flu vaccine lasts much longer in children, and earlier protection can help reduce transmission to the wider population. This includes those aged 2 and 3 years, primary and secondary school children, and children in clinical risk groups. \u00a0"
