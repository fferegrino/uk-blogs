Adult fish will be spawning, or recovering from spawning, and emerging eggs and juvenile fish are also vulnerable. As a result, from 15 March to 15 June inclusive, the statutory coarse fish close season comes into place on rivers, streams, drains and some protected stillwaters and canals."

Being a fish at this time of year is quite an exhausting and stressful business, so any measures to protect them benefit fish populations now and into the future."

This is to ensure people aren\u2019t fishing illegally where the close season applies. Anyone caught fishing on protected waters at this time could face a hefty fine. During last year\u2019s close season, the Environment Agency carried out 933 close season patrols resulting in 106 close season offences and 203 other fishing related offences."
