The AI-driven approach is currently undergoing human validation, but demonstrates the potential for AI to dramatically speed up the use of qualitative analysis in public health research.\u00a0"

Our tech experts and scientists evaluated various LLMs for their ability to analyse thousands of online reviews, screening for key terms related to gastrointestinal symptoms - such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain - alongside mentions of specific food types like meat and fish."

UKHSA maintains hundreds of guidance documents for members of the public and professionals, and consistency is important to reduce the risk from health hazards. Manual reviews of guidance documents are time consuming and challenging. A recent project uses secure LLMs on UKHSA\u2019s computing clusters to automatically detect potential conflicts between public health guidance recommendations. The system lets users upload a piece of guidance in development and automatically retrieves existing, relevant sections of UKHSA guidance, then flags any potential conflicts between them. This is currently being user-tested internally, and is showing promising early results, with over 90% accuracy rates in both retrieving relevant text and identifying discrepancies in recommendations."
