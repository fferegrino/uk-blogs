Motivated by this, and wanting to apply my scientific knowledge in a new setting to bring impact to a wider range of people, I joined government in 2020 working on Public Sector Decarbonisation in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Since then, I\u2019ve also worked in the GSE Profession team in the Government Office for Science, before most recently moving to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology as Fiscal Strategy Lead, working on the Spending Review.\u00a0\u00a0"

In government, however, the focus shifts to the impact and benefits of our work. We always think about why we are doing something and what the broader implications are to ensure we are delivering a tangible difference to people\u2019s lives.\u00a0\u00a0"
