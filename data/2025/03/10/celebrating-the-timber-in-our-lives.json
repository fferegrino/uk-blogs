Wood fuels our fires, supports the smooth movement of goods in the form of pallets and even plays a role in medicine. If you look around, you\u2019re guaranteed to find something made from wood."

Trees capture carbon as they grow, and this carbon continues to be stored in wood products throughout their lifespan. As a country, the importance of producing timber needs to be more prominent in our conversations, recognising that investing in timber is an investment in growth and our planet."

The UK imports 73% of its timber, making it the second largest net importer with only China importing more, and this is a situation we must work to improve. Food security is important, but so is timber security!"
