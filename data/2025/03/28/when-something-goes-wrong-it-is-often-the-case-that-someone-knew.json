            "text": "Recent independent inquiries have laid bare the catastrophic impact of major failures by public sector bodies on innocent lives. The Grenfell, Infected Blood and Post Office inquiries all heard harrowing evidence of human suffering, including the tragic and avoidable loss of life. Public sector failure also comes with a financial penalty \u2013 not just the expense of inquiries to determine why scandals happened and the cost of government compensation schemes borne by the taxpayer. There is also the time public sector bodies must spend dealing with the aftermath of failures, inevitably diverting resources from their organisations\u2019 core purposes. And then there is the damage done to public trust. Public sector organisations wield huge power over the lives of citizens and are entrusted to act in the public interest. When they let down the public, the consequences are manifold and far-reaching."

            "text": "Understandably, the public wants to know that those identified as culpable for failure will face consequences. They rightly want those responsible to be \u2018held accountable\u2019. But how much better would it be if public sector bodies could avert the crisis in the first place?"

            "text": "Of course, the old adage that \u2018hindsight is 20/20\u2019 holds true \u2013 it is far easier to evaluate past decisions from the vantage point of knowing the outcome than it is to foresee problems in advance."

            "text": "Major failings in public life are invariably due to a combination of factors. The picture is usually complex \u2013 illustrated by public inquiries often spanning several years and producing reports that can run into well over a thousand pages. However, a look at some recent public inquiries such as the Grenfell, Infected Blood and Post Office Horizon IT inquiries and independent reviews such as the Windrush review and reviews of maternity services, reveal recurring themes. These include a failure to listen to and act on concerns raised by employees and/or the public, a failure to learn lessons from past mistakes or similar incidents and a failure to identify and share emerging themes that might have alerted the organisation to a developing risk. There is often a failure of the board to have effective oversight of issues and concerns. A common characteristic of bodies responsible for a major failure is an overly defensive organisational culture.\u00a0"

            "text": "To stand a chance of successfully recognising and responding to early warning signs leaders must do four things. They must realise they have a problem, act to address it, identify the wider lessons to be learned and be diligent in ensuring that those lessons are embedded fully within the organisation."

        {
            "text": "When things go wrong, it is often the defensive response of the public sector body and its failure to acknowledge what happened and offer a meaningful apology that compounds the pain suffered. Responding with candour is important following major failures when the public wants to know what has happened. But the responsibility to uphold the principles of honesty and openness goes wider. These principles \u2013 like all of the Seven Principles of Public Life \u2013 are an important guide to the behaviour the public expects at all times."

Rather than making hard recommendations, we offer practical insights and \u2018points for reflection\u2019 intended to help leaders think deeply about the processes and culture in their organisation and consider whether improvements can be made. But the questions are not only for leaders; they can help staff at all levels to challenge their leaders to think about these important matters.\u00a0"

But this isn\u2019t a reason not to try to get better at recognising the first signs of things going wrong and to respond appropriately. The cost of failure is too high not to try."
