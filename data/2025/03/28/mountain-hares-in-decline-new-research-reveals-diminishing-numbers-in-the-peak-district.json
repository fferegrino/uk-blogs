These cold-adapted mammals, with their distinctive seasonal white winter coats, have become an iconic part of our upland landscape."

            "text": "Since 2017, we've been conducting surveys of mountain hare populations in the Peak District using distance sampling methodology - the leading non-invasive technique for wildlife population monitoring worldwide. Our previous research, published in 2022, established baseline population figures of approximately 3,500 mountain hares, with density hotspots of around 15 hares per square kilometre."

            "text": "Our latest findings, based on eight years of continuous monitoring, show a dramatic decline of nearly 60% in the main mountain hare hotspots. Density has fallen to just 6 hares per square kilometre, with the total Peak District population now estimated at only 1,000 individuals - a number that raises serious questions about their long-term viability."

            "text": "The causes of this decline are likely complex and interconnected. As cold-adapted animals, mountain hares are particularly vulnerable to climate change. When their white winter coats no longer match the increasingly snow-free landscape, they become more visible to predators - a phenomenon known as coat colour mismatch."

            "text": "Interestingly, our research indicates that mountain hare numbers appear higher in areas where previously degraded blanket bog has been ecologically restored with diverse vegetation. In contrast, numbers remain very low in areas dominated by deep, impenetrable heather."

We're considering additional methods such as Global Positioning System (GPS) collaring to better understand how mountain hares respond to human activity and environmental changes. However, with such low population densities, this approach may meet initial challenges in actually finding hares for collaring."
