            "text": "There's something magical about watching your children's imagination come alive through LEGO. I recently sat in amazement as my son engineered a car using nothing but LEGO bricks and elastic bands. His eyes lit up with pride as he demonstrated his creation, carefully explaining every technical detail of how he'd made it work. It wasn't something from an instruction manual - it was purely from his own creative mind.\u00a0"

While the colourful sets with their detailed instructions are brilliant fun, it's when the bricks are scattered across the floor and my children are deep in concentration, bringing their wildest ideas to life, that I see the real value of these little plastic blocks. From spaceships with improbable engines to fantastical creatures that exist nowhere else, every creation tells a story and shows me how their minds work in wonderfully unexpected ways.\u00a0\u00a0Our team mate Amber recently delved into the fascinating story behind these beloved bricks, exploring LEGO's remarkable journey from a small Danish woodworking shop to a global brand and the crucial role intellectual property has played in protecting their innovation along the way."

            "text": "LEGO was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932 and, remarkably, the family still owns the company. The name LEGO comes from two Danish words, \u201cleg\u201d and \u201cgodt\u201d, meaning \u201cplay well\u201d, and the bricks were the first of their kind. Originally protected by patents like \u202fGB908097, LEGO is now the world\u2019s most valuable toy company, with a now estimated 86 LEGO bricks per person in the world. Although there are competitors, LEGO dominates the market thanks to its high quality. The plastic is dyed, not painted, and the mix of ingredients is precise enough to make each brick extremely durable.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Since the Christiansen family filed their first patent back in 1958, LEGO's journey has come a long way. The late 1960s saw the arrival of Duplo, the larger brick designed for smaller hands and in 1979 the toy figure, now known as the mini figure, was patented. Suddenly LEGO sets could include people and police, fire and rescue sets started popping up on shelves. These, along with the accessories to compliment them, allowed\u00a0 children to play within the world they had created.\u00a0"

            "text": "By the mid 1970\u2019s, LEGO\u2019s original patents began to expire, forcing the company to think creatively about their IP protection. The company turned to copyright and trade marks to protect its brand, filing two applications for 3D shape trade marks in 1996. While LEGO were able to register the shape of their products as trade marks, they can be complex to obtain. If you\u2019re interested in filing an application for a 3D shape trade mark, we recommend consulting a trade mark attorney [link]: CITMA - Find a Chartered Trade Mark Attorney. \u00a0"

Patents safeguard its innovative technologies, while trade marks protect its brand identity, fostering consumer trust and recognition. Strong IP protection helps prevent counterfeiting, ensuring the integrity of genuine products and encourages investment in research and development, leading to a broader range of creative and engaging toys.\u00a0"
