            "text": "For decades, the UK has faced a sustained threat from terrorism. That threat has amplified since October 2023, Hamas\u2019s attacks in Israel and the ensuing fallout."

            "text": "While we rightly focus on the tragic outcomes of terrorist acts, we must also understand what drives individuals to commit them in the first place."

            "text": "As the government's independent adviser on extremism, I have long observed a persistent debate about what motivates terrorism. Some point to the role of ideas. Others emphasise socioeconomics, personal trauma, or mental illness. This debate matters enormously for how we shape our counter-terrorism policies."

            "text": "To bring clarity to this question, I commissioned Dr Donald Holbrook to conduct forensic research examining the electronic content collected from 100 UK terrorists over several decades. His findings, published today, are unequivocal and significant."

        },
        {
            "text": "What Dr Holbrook discovered is striking. Terrorists do not merely dabble with extremist ideology \u2013 they immerse themselves in it. They actively seek out, consume, debate, and even produce ideological content that guides and justifies their actions."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over half of the individuals studied had created their own ideological material justifying their involvement in terrorism. This demonstrates a level of engagement with extremist ideas that goes far beyond casual interest."
        },
        {
            "text": "This research proves decisively that ideology is not peripheral to terrorism \u2013 it's central. It explains why terrorists fight, what they hope to achieve, and what actions they consider justified in pursuit of their goals."

            "text": "Islamist ideology tends to be more theological, focused on justifying violence through religious interpretations, whereas Extreme Right Wing content is often more openly hostile and violent."

        {
            "text": "Terrorists draw inspiration from a surprisingly broad range of sources, not just the most radical voices. In the case of Islamist terrorism, individuals were influenced by clerics traditionally associated with 'non-violent' groups such as Muslim Brotherhood ideologue Sayyid Qutb."

            "text": "Only with deep understanding of extremist ideologies can we develop effective counter-extremism policies. This expertise cannot be developed by academics and think tanks alone \u2013 it requires the involvement of practitioners and policymakers."

            "text": "There are reasons for optimism. The Counter Extremism Sprint commissioned by government following the horrific murders in Southport demonstrated a desire to address the root causes of extremism. The Home Secretary has publicly acknowledged the need to confront the ideological drivers of terrorism."

            "text": "However, we must be careful not to lose focus. While addressing individuals with poor mental health who may be drawn to violence is important, we must not create more haystacks when we need to be homing in on the needle."
        },
        {
            "text": "The government must be nimble, seeking a balance that allows it to tackle both violence-fixated individuals and terrorists simultaneously, using the most appropriate tools of the state. Sometimes these approaches will overlap. Often, they will not."
