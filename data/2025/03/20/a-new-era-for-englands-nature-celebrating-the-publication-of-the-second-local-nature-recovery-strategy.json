It marks a significant milestone towards our country\u2019s efforts to tackle biodiversity loss, climate change and improving people\u2019s access to nature as part of a growing national Nature Recovery Network. Out of a total of 48 Strategies in the pipeline, North Northamptonshire is the second to reach publication so far. It highlights what can be achieved when Local Authorities, NGOs and wide-ranging local partners work collaboratively towards a shared ambition for nature recovery."

They aim to drive more co-ordinated, practical and focused action to recover nature. Selected Local Authorities, collectively covering the whole of England, have been tasked by Government with developing these plans for nature, biodiversity and wider environmental goals."

North Northamptonshire Council lead the development of the Strategy as the Responsible Authority (RA) with input from partners including the public, the Wildlife Trust Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire (BCN), Northamptonshire Biodiversity Records Centre (NBRC), Natural England (NE), Forestry Commission (FC) and the Environment Agency (EA). With their priorities reflected in the Strategy, these partners now have both a stake and agency to deliver on them. Delivery of the LNRS will contribute towards meeting the Government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan targets, supporting our national objectives."

            "text": "The LNRS identifies priority areas through the production of a Local Habitat Map. The RA commissioned Natural Capital Solutions to undertake this key task. This consultancy had already shown its skill in analysing complex datasets to identify opportunities for nature recovery through an earlier Natural Capital and Habitat Opportunity project. The mapping was praised during the review process for the advanced analysis of multiple data sources, which resulted in clearly indicated priority locations where action for nature would be most effective. If all nature recovery actions presented on the Local Habitat Map are delivered, we could see an increase in land managed sympathetically for nature by 24.5%."

The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area (SPA) has seen reduction of wintering birds at a faster rate than the UK average (76% decline in Golden Plover, and 45% decline in Lapwing populations since 2011). The LNRS focuses on practical actions to reduce recreational pressure and increase the extent of supporting habitat for these declining species. It\u2019s one of many areas where Natural England\u2019s experts supported the Strategy. In this case, Natural England\u2019s ornithologists gave their advice on measures to support the SPA and inform North Northamptonshire\u2019s Local Plan development."

The Wildlife Trust BCN produced a Statement of Biodiversity.

Nene Rivers Trust CEO Kathryn Soares commended the \u201cbold and brave\u201d decision to have a bottom-up approach with the Strategy\u2019s development, empowering local partners to play a key role in LNRS creation. The Wildlife Trust BCN Conservation Manager, Matt Johnson, commented on the recent success of their beaver reintroduction project (practical action number 100) \u2013 saying \u201cif we\u2019ve managed to achieve that action, the other 107 will be a breeze\u201d. Hard work and dedication will achieve nature recovery, and all who attended left the event feeling inspired."

And that means nature will be there for us, for our health, wealth and security. Meeting that ambition is a long road ahead but North Northamptonshire\u2019s LNRS takes us one significant step towards it."
