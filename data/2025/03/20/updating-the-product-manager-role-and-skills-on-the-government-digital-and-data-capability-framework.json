The Government Digital and Data Capability Framework defines digital and data roles in government and the skills expected at different role levels. Since its launch in 2017, many of the digital and data roles listed in the framework have largely stayed the same. "

As Head of Profession for Product it felt timely when I joined DfE in April 2024 to review the product manager role. To support this, I\u2019ve been working with Olivia Helliwell, from Government Digital Service (GDS), who leads content for the Framework."
