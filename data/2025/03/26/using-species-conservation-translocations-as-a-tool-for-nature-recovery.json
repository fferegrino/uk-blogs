This applies to all projects, including those led by Natural England. The level of evidence required will vary depending on the nature of the proposal. Proposals that seek to restore ecosystem function at a landscape scale or that involve species where the potential impact of their release is not fully understood, are likely to require significant evidence gathering (biological, social and economic) before proceeding. However, we strive to balance the need for sufficient evidence and the risk of inaction."

It is also an offence to release into the wild any animal or plant listed on Schedule 9. The schedule lists certain species that are ordinarily resident or regular visitors but whose release needs to be controlled, including certain native species (e.g. barn owls).\u00a0 The release of a former native species is therefore controlled because it involves a kind of animal that is no longer ordinarily resident. Guidance to help interpret these terms can be found on GOV.UK."

Releases of such animals will therefore require a licence unless it is agreed by Natural England that a licence is unnecessary."
