We showed that they too could grow up to do programming and themselves as a career. There were so many girls who had clearly never considered doing anything technical before, and it was so exciting to show them a new path and help them realise the possibilities before them."

Throughout my career, it has been rare to work in a team with another female engineer, and it\u2019s clear that women remain significantly underrepresented in this field."

            "text": "Women are underrepresented in software development. According to a Diversity in Tech report in 2024, only 20% of software developers in the UK were women or non-binary.\u00a0 At Justice Digital in 2023 our representation stood below this average at 17%."

            "text": "This lack of representation is particularly surprising given the strong history of women in computing. Back in the 19th century, Ada Lovelace theorised how a computer could be programmed to solve complex calculations, essentially making her the first-ever computer programmer. The original \u201ccomputers\u201d were, in fact, women: human mathematicians who analysed data using mechanical calculators."

            "text": "This working group includes some wonderful people in a variety of roles across all teams in Justice Digital. We will work to come up with ways to improve the representation of women in engineering by looking at how we can improve recruitment and retention, how to better support our women, and see how we can contribute to the wider community of women in tech."

I would love to hear your ideas and suggestions on how we can make this a reality. I can be contacted at natalie.wood@digital.justice.gov.uk"
