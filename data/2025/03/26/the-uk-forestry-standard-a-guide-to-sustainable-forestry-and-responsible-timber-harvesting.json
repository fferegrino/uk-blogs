        {
            "text": "Different silvicultural practices are used to grow and harvest trees depending on site type, species choice and the objectives of the forester. Techniques such as continuous cover forestry, which is gaining popularity, maintains a permanent canopy while allowing for selective harvesting. It can help increase resilience to climate change by providing shade and shelter to the next generation of trees, either planted or germinated from seeds from nearby trees. Selective systems provide a more stable habitat overall, which suits a wide range of woodland species, though not all.\u00a0"

Clearfell benefits bird species including nightjar and woodlark that like open and woodland edge habitats. This management practice is a requirement of some designated \u2018special protection areas\u2019 aimed at protecting these species.\u00a0"

To protect ecosystems, harvesting is carefully timed and low impact techniques are promoted to conserve soil health, reduce compaction and prevent erosion. Forest managers are encouraged to avoid harvesting during the bird nesting season and avoid practices that degrade soils and historic features such as woodbanks; such as the use of heavy machinery when ground conditions are wet. This often means being mindful of when to harvest timber and maintaining buffer zones.\u00a0"
