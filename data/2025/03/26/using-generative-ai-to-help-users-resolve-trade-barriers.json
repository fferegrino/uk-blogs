When businesses report barriers they face, there is a cross-government effort to resolve the barrier quickly and efficiently. The Digital Market Access Service (DMAS) facilitates the management of trade barriers. We recently introduced a Large Language Model (LLM) feature to improve knowledge sharing across global teams."

After downloading the dataset of over 3,000 barriers, they would have to run through a complex search of over 50 keywords to find all relevant barriers. "

Potential duplicate barriers might look like a black labrador or a golden retriever. Whereas barriers which are poor matches might look like a Staffordshire terrier\u00a0. While they are all dogs, labradors and retrievers are much more similar than a Staffordshire terrier, and the technology can understand this nuance.'"
