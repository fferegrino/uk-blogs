            "text": "Since we announced the pilot cohort in early December, the AI Airlock team has been busy onboarding the successful candidates and working with them to design and implement bespoke testing plans. AI medical devices have the potential to radically transform healthcare if implemented safely. However, it can be difficult to evaluate and ensure the safety, accuracy and explainability of these products, which requires an agile regulatory framework. The AI Airlock pilot cohort highlight four cutting-edge projects addressing some of these challenges, each focused on advancing the role of AI while meeting critical safety standards."

It explores the use of TAG-RAG technology, a novel approach to overcoming regulatory concerns associated with the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare. Their Airlock case study seeks to determine what constitutes sufficient clinical evidence of safety while assessing SmartGuideline\u2019s ability to minimise hallucinations, improve knowledge retrieval, and ensure more preordained responses."

Since LLMs are often criticised for their lack of transparency, OncoFlow is designed to provide clear, comprehensible, and consistent justifications for its outputs, ensuring that clinicians and specialists can trust its recommendations. The study compares different AI models to evaluate their performance, explainability, and clinical utility in processing unstructured oncology data."

The study hypothesises that there should be no significant difference between synthetically generated summaries and real data in terms of quality. A key objective for this case study is to understand the parameters that define high-quality synthetic data, the challenges of using LLMs to generate such data, and how AI can be leveraged for validation."

Federated AI Monitoring Service (FAMOS) by Newton\u2019s Tree is designed to enhance the safety and performance of third-party AI medical devices. By identifying performance variations and safety issues in real-time, FAMOS aims to improve risk management and regulatory compliance. This case study will investigate the use of real-time monitoring systems for identifying performance variations and safety issues within a product\u2019s post market surveillance and safety monitoring of AI as a medical device."

Each candidate gave detailed presentations about the regulatory challenge and some early insights from testing so far. In the afternoon the group discussed the future of the Airlock programme and captured all important lessons to be learned. This will help us create guidance and support for companies bringing new and transformative AI technologies to the health system."

We have now completed the Simulation Airlock testing - roundtable workshops involving open discussions and brainstorming exercises. These sessions brought together technology and regulatory stakeholders to address focussed questions and provide critical insights from their areas of expertise. The next steps include drafting outputs based on insights from the simulations and virtual testing. Over the summer, an extensive AI Airlock programme report will be prepared including learning from each pilot project as well as key insights from the overarching programme evaluation. We will also be aiming to hold a public webinar to mark the final step in the pilot programme."
