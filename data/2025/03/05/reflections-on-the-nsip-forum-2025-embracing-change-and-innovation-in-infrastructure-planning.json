What's particularly interesting is the pipeline of over 70 projects at pre-application stage. While the energy sector continues to dominate, we're seeing some notable trends: solar projects are increasing, as are electric line applications, while there's been a decline in both road projects and offshore wind developments."

In the run up to and during pre-application, it's vital to thoroughly read and understand Government Guidance and our Pre-Application Prospectus. We strongly encourage early engagement with relevant parties around drafting of protective provisions and emphasise the importance of good design too! Do check out our recently updated and published advice and associated webinars."
