Drawing on everything we've learned, we're assembling a team of project management and business change experts from across HMCTS and beyond. With their expertise we'll focus on carefully managed, incremental improvements that will allow us to better deliver changes and make the justice system work better for everyone.\u00a0"

We'll also expand the system to handle more types of cases, including probation breaches and all non-police prosecutors, increasing the capabilities of the system and streamlining more processes. The link between the Crown Court's Digital Case System and Common Platform will be strengthened, further improving the movement of materials between magistrates' and the Crown Court. I'm confident that these changes will help build a more efficient service that works better for everyone who uses it.\u00a0"

In 2024, Service Centres handled over three-quarters of a million phone calls and emails relating to criminal cases. Last year we migrated all calls from magistrates\u2019 courts in the North West and South West regions to our Service Centres. We\u2019ll be extending these improvements to the remaining 5 regions in the first half of 2025, reducing pressure on court staff and improving services for our court users.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Every case now has a single unique reference number that can be used by all parties - from police to CPS to courts - making it much simpler to track a case. When cases conclude, police forces receive instant notifications of Crown Court results, enabling faster updates to the Police National Computer. Non-Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) prosecutors are now able to view and upload case materials directly on a case-by-case basis, as well as check in to hearings, streamlining the process further for another of our partners.\u00a0"

We\u2019ve now introduced this to all police forces to prosecute SJP cases in this way. It is enabling them \u2013 and a range of other non-police prosecutors \u2013 to deliver functions more swiftly and accurately.\u00a0"
