After explaining everything and having a good cry, they encouraged me to contact the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) and talk to my manager about putting a Carer\u2019s Passport in place.\u00a0 I was assigned a counsellor whom I spoke to for 6 sessions. I found it incredibly cathartic and it helped me immensely during a particularly difficult time. I also looked up Carer\u2019s Passports, and arranged a meeting with my line manager who was and has been incredibly supportive about the whole thing.
