            "text": "The UK Government is embarking on an ambitious digital transformation of public services as outlined in the blueprint for a modern digital government released earlier this year. TechTrack, our innovative digital apprenticeship programme, is at its heart. This programme will bring in 2,000 talented apprentices into Whitehall departments by 2030, creating a powerful pipeline of digital expertise across government and comes alongside a wider announcement to nearly double the number of civil servants working in digital and data roles. Alongside the reskilling of thousands of existing civil servants, TechTrack represents a bold commitment to ensuring we have the critical skills needed to revolutionise public services through technology - generating opportunities nationwide and delivering tangible benefits to citizens."
