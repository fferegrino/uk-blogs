            "text": "Space weather occurs when explosive events near the Sun\u2019s surface project strong radiation fields towards the Earth. These events typically peak during solar maximum \u2013 a cycle that occurs approximately every 11 years \u2013 but serious events can also happen during solar minimum. Currently, we are experiencing a maximum, with solar activity at its highest level in more than 2 decades."

            "text": "As the Sun reaches its most active period in 22 years, we\u2019re increasingly aware of the risks we face from severe space weather events. An example of this was seen in the \u2018Mothers\u2019 Day Storm\u2019 in May 2024, which produced aurora visible across southern England. This was the strongest solar storm since 2003 to hit the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. There were stunning images to be seen, but UKHSA scientists were also studying these events to work out whether they posed a risk to people."

Those at greatest risk include individuals in high-altitude aviation and space environments, where the magnetic and atmospheric protection offered by the Earth is reduced."

            "text": "The threat related to the aurora is chiefly from the magnetic fields that cause them, which can induce currents in conductors at sea level. These magnetic fields caused a major electricity grid failure in Ottawa in 1989 and less significant grid failures in South Africa and Sweden more recently. But none of the events that caused those impacts were close to being as powerful as the 1859 Carrington Event, which caused geomagnetic storms and disruption to telegraph communications. It is often taken as a benchmark for a worst-case scenario, but historic records show that events in the one-in-a-thousand-year category could be much worse even than the Carrington Event."

Arrangements for a severe space weather event are regularly exercised to test preparedness, including the advice we feed into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)."
