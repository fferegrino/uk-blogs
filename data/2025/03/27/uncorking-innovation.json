Wine, like everything else, has plenty of hidden intellectual property (IP). From its branding, protected by trade marks, to ornate labels registered as designs, IP flows with each pour. My colleague Sara recently explored the origins of the corkscrew, the key that opens your favourite bottle, so today, we're diving into a key part of its IP and how it changed the game. It turns out that just like a good bottle, this invention has increased in value throughout time\u2026\u00a0"

            "text": "Believe it or not, the person wine enthusiasts have to thank for being able to open a bottle of their favourite tipple with ease this summer, is a member of the English clergy. Cheshire-born Reverend, Samuel Henshall, was granted the first patent for the corkscrew in 1795, and his patent, No. 2061 issued on 24 August 1795, represented a significant innovation in wine access technology.\u00a0"

            "text": "Henshall's design wasn't the first corkscrew ever created - earlier versions had existed since the mid-17th century when cork became the standard bottle stopper, but his was the first to receive formal intellectual property protection. This was thanks to his clever addition of a disk that prevented the worm (spiral section) from going too far into the cork. This became known as the Henshall button, and the seemingly small invention made the device patentable, paving the way for the future of innovation in corkscrews.\u00a0\u00a0"

He dealt with financial debt throughout his life, and it's reported that upon his death in 1807, he was buried with the remaining stock of his corkscrews - a poignant symbol of an invention that, while revolutionary, failed to provide its creator with the financial rewards of his IP.\u00a0"

One modern wine opening technology even allows users to pour wine from a sealed bottle without even popping the cork. The Coravin system, protected by a plethora of patents, including EP2844606, allows wine to be extracted without removing the cork at all - an innovation that may have seemed like pure magic to Henshall.\u00a0"
