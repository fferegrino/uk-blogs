Over the six month period dividing our user research studies, the civil servants\u2019 awareness of AI has increased and people have become more familiar with tools like chatbots. However, the way they conceptualise AI has been shaped by the prominence of generative AI tools, with some participants associating AI primarily with generative AI."

Generative AI tools are not the solution to every problem and present issues of accuracy, potential bias, and, in some cases, sustainability. It is important that people implementing AI services demystify AI for their stakeholders, making sure that they understand the potential and limitations of different AI technologies when considering if AI is the right tool for the job."

User research suggests that, in addition to training and guidance, sometimes a single example or case study can help demystify AI and change people\u2019s attitude. During interviews several people mentioned a specific presentation, conversation, or case study that got them excited about AI and prompted them to learn more."
