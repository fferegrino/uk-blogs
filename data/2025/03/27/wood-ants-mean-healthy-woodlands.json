One of these insects, wood ants (Formica rufa), are architects of the forest floor and have been shaping Britain\u2019s woodlands for years. They tell a complex story of survival and cooperation, and their presence as a \u2018keystone\u2019 and \u2018indicator\u2019 species tells us a lot about the health of our woodlands.\u00a0"

            "text": "In a bizarre act of symbiosis, wood ants 'farm' aphids by stroking their abdomens to encourage the secretion of honeydew, which is the excess sugary sap that aphids extract from plants. In return, the aphids escape being eaten and the ants protect them from predators like ladybirds. This is because when under attack, wood ants spray formic acid into the air that deters predators, which incidentally also smells like salt and vinegar crisps!\u00a0"
