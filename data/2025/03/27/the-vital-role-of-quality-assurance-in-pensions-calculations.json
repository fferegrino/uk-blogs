In the pensions world, they can arise through errors in numbers or in the way that we present and communicate information. They can be genuine errors or misinterpretations of data and information held on our administration systems. Some, due to poor or incomplete data, may be outside of the administrators\u2019 control while others arise from individual or systemic issues within pension systems and processes."

In the vast majority of cases, administrators provide good, clear and accurate information to their members. Very little is ever said about the considerable number of transactions and interactions that members have with their pension providers every day where things go right."
