If storm overflows operate when they shouldn\u2019t, they can affect the water quality in our rivers and coasts. EDM data helps to inform our inspections \u2013 we use it to identify which overflows have unusually high spill counts or durations to inform where to investigate.\u00a0\u00a0 When we find that water companies have broken the law, we take a wide range of actions \u2013 including prosecutions for the most serious offences."

            "text": "Our role is to take action which brings about the best outcome for the environment, and make sure those who pollute pay \u2013 depending on the severity and circumstances of a spill this can range from warnings to criminal prosecutions. For example, last year Severn Trent Water were fined \u00a32million for raw sewage discharges; and Yorkshire Water paid \u00a31million to two environmental and wildlife charities following an investigation by the Environment Agency."

Take, for example, at a wastewater pumping station in Hampshire. Using EDM data, our officers could see that it was discharging an unusually high number of times. During their inspection of the station, they found that the site was breaching its permit and identified lots of other risks which could affect the storm overflow use.\u00a0Southern Water is now addressing the concerns and non-compliances during our inspection to reduce the impact on the environment."

Undoubtedly, the results from this year\u2019s returns show that the current situation is far from where we want it to be; but what this data gives us is greater transparency, enabling greater scrutiny about the scale of the issue. It\u2019s the evidence we need to drive tougher actions and underpin future planning, which will ultimately see spill counts reduce and support wider economic growth."
