What if an employee\u2019s concerns had been taken seriously? Or a complaint had been escalated to the right person and preventative action had been taken? Or if lessons had been learnt from past similar incidents or failures? How much pain and suffering could have been prevented \u2013 and how much resource could have been redeployed across the public sector?"

Our review \u2013 launched last year \u2013 looks at how this can be done. As well as a public consultation, we have been hearing first hand from leaders and practitioners with a wide range of views and experiences about how the public sector can get better at acting on early warning signs.\u00a0"

Our findings \u2013 based on the wide range of evidence we heard \u2013 are intended to support leaders to work through what improvements can be made to their own organisation\u2019s processes and culture and can be used by staff to encourage attention in these areas.\u00a0"
