Each year International Women\u2019s Day celebrates the growing contributions of female entrepreneurs around the world and this year\u2019s theme \u2018accelerate action\u2019, provides a global call to deliver strategies to advance women's equality.\u00a0 Despite significant progress, the United Nations reports that women are less likely to be entrepreneurs and face more disadvantages when starting businesses, and globally women remain less likely to participate in the labour market than men."

The report also recommends improvements to the framework within which regulations are made. This includes ensuring that when new regulations are created, gender impacts are considered, and women are consulted on the regulatory reform decisions that impact them most, to take into account socio-cultural norms and avoid unintended negative consequences."
