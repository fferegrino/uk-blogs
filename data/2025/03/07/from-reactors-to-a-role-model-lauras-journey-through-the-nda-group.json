Whilst at times I have found myself in the minority as a female professional on sites, I have seen a change in this over my 22 years in NDA group. I am encouraged to be part of an organisation that is committed to shifting the dial on gender balance in the nuclear industry and I am proud to be a woman in nuclear on International Women\u2019s Day. \u00a0"

I had made the decision to go to work at 18 instead of going to university and I wanted to pursue a career in nuclear - the industry that is the heartbeat of the community I was born and raised in."

            "text": "I spent my first 5 years in the environmental analytical laboratories at Sellafield analysing a range of samples for radioactivity to demonstrate Sellafield\u2019s work was safe and compliant with its permit. The work was rewarding and felt really connected to our core purpose of creating a clean and safe environment for the future, but I was keen to gain broader experience in the industry. I took a bit of a leap, which was daunting at a young age, and moved to another NDA group site over 400 miles away in Caithness, Scotland. Dounreay - the site of the UK's fast breeder reactor research and development. That\u2019s where my career in waste management began."

            "text": "I gained invaluable experience from my time at Dounreay, learning about all aspects of the nuclear lifecycle through supporting the management of radioactive waste generated from the site\u2019s oldest facilities and working to solve some first of a kind decommissioning challenges."

            "text": "I then moved to Nuclear Restoration Services (formerly Magnox) which is a subsidiary of the NDA. At the time NRS were responsible for decommissioning twelve sites across the UK which gave me a unique opportunity to work in a diverse range of roles. I spent time at Bradwell in Essex, Trawsfynydd in Wales and Chapelcross in Scotland before being appointed to oversee waste operations across all twelve sites allowing me to travel and work across them all."

This includes participating in the Whitehall and Industry Group Women\u2019s Leadership Programme and a secondment into Scottish Government providing strategic and technical leadership as they developed the programme of work to underpin the upcoming Scottish Higher Activity Waste (HAW) policy."

As part of this work, I was able to visit the Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD) Closure Project in Ontario, an initiative to safely decommission Canada's first nuclear power reactor. Sharing learning and expertise with our international counterparts helps the NDA develop robust strategies and implementation approaches to decommissioning and waste management challenges in the UK."

It\u2019s impossible to choose a single highlight but a couple of specific memorable milestones have been being part of the team that consigned the first Low Level Waste into the new LLW disposal facility adjacent to the Dounreay site, and supporting UK Government on the development of the UK policy framework for managing radioactive substances and nuclear decommissioning, published in 2024. \u00a0\u00a0"

Working across the NDA group has given me some amazing opportunities and I am looking forward to seeing what comes next."
