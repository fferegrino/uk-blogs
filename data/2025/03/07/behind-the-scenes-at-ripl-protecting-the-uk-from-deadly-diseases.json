Every day, our scientists receive clinical samples from healthcare providers across the UK. Using diagnostic techniques like serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, our teams work to quickly identify diseases that might be difficult to diagnose in hospital laboratories."

            "text": "Our specialist laboratories are equipped to detect and contain high-risk viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, and Lassa fever. These infections may be imported into the UK by returning travellers and, although extremely rare it is important to provide 24/7 access to testing to make sure proper infection control and public health measures are put in place.\u00a0 We receive about one sample per week for testing for possible imported viral haemorrhagic fevers. And our rigorous containment and safety measures ensure that no pathogen slips through the cracks."

            "text": "Our scientists and clinicians have developed tailored diagnostic panels based on patient travel history and symptoms. These panels cover 10 world regions, allowing us to look for a number of infections in a single sample as quickly as possible, rather than ruling out possibilities one by one. From imported viruses to bacterial diseases like anthrax and Q fever, our expertise spans a wide range of infectious threats."

            "text": "Beyond testing hospital samples, RIPL is involved in other public health protection and surveillance work. For example, we provide testing for anthrax for samples from potentially contaminated old buildings or suspected animal infections. We are also involved in a wide range of surveillance work, including testing samples from blood donors and healthy volunteers to assess the risk of vector-borne disease in the UK.\u00a0"
