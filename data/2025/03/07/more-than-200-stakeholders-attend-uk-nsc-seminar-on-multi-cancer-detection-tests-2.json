So, a single test for multiple cancers will have different cancer-specific benefits and harms. Such differences have clinical and policy implications that would be missed by solely focusing on aggregate, rather than individual, cancer outcomes."

It concludes that aggregate outcomes are a necessary first step that could show that an MCD has potential, but policymakers will ultimately need robust evidence of cancer-specific benefits and harms to effectively consider multi-cancer screening programme proposals.\u00a0"
