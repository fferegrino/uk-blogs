            "text": "The recently published blueprint for a modern digital government was the result of many weeks of researching, sketching and prototyping, by teams working as part of the Digital Centre Design team in GDS. We were keen to explore what the ideas in the blueprint might look and behave like, when they inevitably bump up against the rough edges of the real world. We spent some time thinking through not only a vision of the future, but what making that vision true would require of us, and colleagues in the public sector."

            "text": "We wanted to understand what a modern digital government would feel like if you were a citizen, a public servant, front line worker or a business owner. We looked at the joins between services. We came up with the idea of making them more like furrows and less like obstacles. We spent as much time thinking about trust and transparency of services, as we did about technology.\u00a0"

            "text": "In traditional GDS fashion, this was best done by thinking and working as openly as possible, using a wall, and taking people through our thinking as much as possible. We took temporary ownership of a tiny \u2018pod\u2019 in one corner of the GDS office in Whitechapel, and began covering its walls with assumptions, principles, sketches, case studies and concepts.\u00a0"

            "text": "The beauty of working on walls is that they instantly turn into presentations when you need them to. So when colleagues passed by, or when helpful visitors turned up, we were able to talk through our thinking, and literally point at thoughts and the connections between them. Even though we\u2019re big supporters of remote and flexible working, it was, we have to admit, a refreshing reminder of the benefits of working together in the same space at the same time."

They checked in our early thinking, helping to keep us honest, refine the messages, and join the dots. They pushed us to be ambitious and to keep people at the heart of the vision.\u00a0"

That helped us feel more confident that we were going in the right direction."

That\u2019s not a new concept - GDS was thinking similar thoughts a decade ago - but we were trying to make use of everything that\u2019s been learned in those intervening years.\u00a0"

(Digital credentials - ways of proving facts about things - are an essential part of this, and still very much in their infancy in UK digital government services.) We know we need a downward flow of permission, from the highest levels, to assure colleagues that the big changes necessary are changes they\u2019re allowed to make. And we know that the scale of the task is enormous, stretching out far beyond the remit of central government - which in turn adds more complexity, and needs more courage from teams and their leaders. This is bold stuff.\u00a0"

We made simple scenarios with words and pictures, which morphed over time into slides we used to help us explain our thinking to ministers and civil servants. We discussed ways that services could \u2018do more\u2019 for users, by making inferences and suggestions. What might that look like?\u00a0"
