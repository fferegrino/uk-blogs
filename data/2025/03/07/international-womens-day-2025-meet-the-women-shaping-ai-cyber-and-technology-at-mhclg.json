But I\u2019ve also had incredible allies who made me feel truly valued. International Women\u2019s Day has been so important \u2013 hearing stories of women in leadership roles kept me going. I consciously decided to persevere, knowing this is my dream career and I belong here just as much as anyone else.\u00a0"

You are unique, you have talent \u2013 take this to the table and be unapologetically yourself!\u00a0"
