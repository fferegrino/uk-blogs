I joined the civil service in 2004, working as a Marketing and Event Manager. It was my transferable skillset of organising and engagement that led me to my current role. My first year consisted of shadowing and supporting my current line manager and I learnt all about project management at various sites across the south of England."

            "text": "At this time, there were not many female project managers, so it was very common to find myself surrounded by men when attending meetings. Being new into this environment, with little knowledge and experience, I secretly felt very intimidated \u2013 not because the people I worked with, but because I was female, I felt like I didn\u2019t fit in."

        {
            "text": "However, after working closely with my team, I gained a deep insight into project management and I really enjoyed the learning and experiences I was exposed to. I have to thank my current line manager, George Liu, because I learnt so much from him when I first joined, and continue to do so now."

            "text": "I have been involved in many high-profile projects, including an extensive refurbishment of infrastructure to support the capability of 2 Military Intelligence Battalion at Trenchard Lines, Upavon. The project involved remodelling an aircraft hangar, built in the 1930s, to provide Light Aid Detachment workshops. Refurbishment to the Battalion headquarters and Junior Ranks\u2019 dining space, and a new extension to the armoury and ammunition store. This project was officially handed over in December 2024."

The new build project which was officially handed over in January 2025 is one of the first full glulam construction on MOD estates. The building is approximately 2,000m2 and meets NET Zero requirements."

I have been able to apply my learnings from these qualifications to my job and I now lead and mentor Assistant Project Managers through various projects."

I work with some incredibly talented women (and men, of course!) and I feel proud to work for DIO, where diversity is celebrated and encouraged, even when it goes against the \u2018typical\u2019 idea of who would do that job."
