I would often think how helpful it\u2019d be if there was a centralised platform where I could get access to all the professional and technical information that I needed, all in one place. It seemed like something of a pipe dream at the time, but the good news is that it\u2019s finally here. Our Government Internal Audit Knowledge Hub network site is your new go-to place for everything that you need to know about internal audit in government."

            "text": "The hub site is a game-changing resource where we can store, organise, and share a wealth of information for users from across the UK government internal audit function. In even better news, our one-stop shop is completely free. It's like having your own personal internal audit library at your fingertips."

            "text": "One of the best things about our new site is its ability to help you overcome two major barriers - the unknown unknowns and not knowing who to ask for help or for information. By joining our new Knowledge Hub network for government internal audit, you can easily discover what information and resources are available to you AND you can connect with other colleagues in our function to take part in constructive discussions and share ideas."

So I won\u2019t argue with that \u2013 there\u2019s, nothing more to say other than let\u2019s soar together. See you soon at the hub!"
