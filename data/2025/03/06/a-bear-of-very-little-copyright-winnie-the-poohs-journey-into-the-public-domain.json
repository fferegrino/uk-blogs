As an avid reader, I have many fond memories of heading into school dressed as my favourite characters, and while I'm not donning a costume this year, I am thinking about the IP in some of my favourite children's books. Today I\u2019m exploring all things IP in Winnie-the-Pooh, one of Britain's most beloved bears. I\u2019m one of many people who have always loved A.A. Milne's stories of Pooh and his pals, and so I was intrigued to hear that this little bear is the centre of some big copyright discussions.\u00a0"

It gives creators control over how their work is used, copied and adapted, ensuring they can benefit from their creativity and continue producing work we all enjoy.\u00a0"

Milne passed away in 1956, the original Winnie-the-Pooh stories will enter UK public domain on 1st January 2027. The illustrations by E. H. Shepard have separate protection, and as he died in 1976, the illustrations will stop being protected on 1st January 2047. This means that for now in the UK, Pooh is protected - but this isn't the case everywhere\u2026\u00a0"

He first appeared in \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\". This adaptation was able to appear before the books entered the public domain thanks to Disney's licensing agreement with the Milne estate. A licence is an agreement between an IP right owner and another party, granting permission to use protected material in specific ways, showing how intellectual property can be commercially shared while maintaining protection. Through careful licensing, Pooh has appeared in numerous formats while maintaining his cherished character, and the Disney version of Winnie-the-Pooh has become infamous.\u00a0"

This trade mark protection will likely continue even after the copyright of the original books expires, ensuring Disney's particular interpretation remains protected.\u00a0"
