These hubs help people understand some of the barriers disabled users may face by using various simulation tools. Initially, they were set up in different locations with physical equipment like simulation glasses and ear defenders, offering a hands-on way to experience accessibility challenges."

We have since refined and expanded them to better fit our sessions. The feedback we received from our sessions was always very positive; the only suggestion being to add more personas."
