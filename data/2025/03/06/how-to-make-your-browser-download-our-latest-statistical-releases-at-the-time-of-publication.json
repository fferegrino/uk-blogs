The code of practice for statistics requires that \u201cstatistics should be available to all users at the same time\u201d so we must ensure our website can meet demand. To do this, we cache our website content and explain here why we do it, the different types of caching and how to make sure your browser downloads our releases at the time of publication."

Browsers on end user devices also use caching.\u00a0 Every time a user visits a webpage, the browser downloads everything on that webpage - HTML, JavaScript, stylesheets, images etc.\u00a0 To speed up the time it takes to display the page again, the browser caches everything it downloads by saving a copy of the files on the device.\u00a0 Browsers store these files until their time to live (TTL) expires or users manually clear their browser cache (TTL tells the browser how long to cache the content before downloading it again)."
