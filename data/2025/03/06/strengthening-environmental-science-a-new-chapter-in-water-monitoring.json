This state-of-the-art facility demonstrates how protecting our environment and growing our economy can work hand in hand \u2013 creating skilled jobs for scientists and researchers while strengthening England\u2019s capabilities in environmental science and innovation. The refurbishment, funded through Defra\u2019s Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme, will help protect our waters while supporting the businesses that depend on them."

Like many public sector organisations, we have faced resource pressures in recent years, a challenge recognised by many environmental organisations and specialists. The refurbishment of our Leeds laboratory represents an important step forward in our ongoing work. This investment will enhance our monitoring capabilities, providing increased capacity to analyse samples from our newest monitoring networks while helping us build on our existing scientific expertise."

We monitor more than 1,800 different elements in water, from chemical compounds to microscopic life, helping us understand and protect our rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. This work fulfils 42 different legislative requirements, split across nearly 100 programmes and environmental themes."

Our team of over 1,000 skilled scientists and technical experts use this data to make evidence-based decisions that protect and improve our environment. Whether it's responding to pollution incidents or tracking long-term changes, every action is grounded in robust science."

This baseline will tell us what our waters are like now, helping us measure and understand changes in the future. The NCEA programme has designed new monitoring networks to provide a national-scale picture across different water environments - including rivers, small streams, lakes, groundwater and estuaries & coasts. As these networks are established over the coming years, they will help build our baseline understanding of England's waters."

We have already collected data from 1,400 sites across England\u2019s rivers, working towards our target of 1,600 sites. To ensure we get an unbiased nationally representative picture, we use a scientific method that randomly selects sites across all types of rivers. At these locations, we will be gathering and analysing different features of river health, from the chemical makeup of the water to the tiny plants and animals that live in it."

We're exploring how this data can help us understand the broader benefits our waters provide - from supporting wildlife to contributing to local communities and the economy. By looking at our rivers, streams and other water bodies through this 'natural capital' lens, we can better understand their value to society and how they change over time."
