            "text": "Firstly, we don't think customers were given clear and timely information about how the pricing of certain tickets would work. In particular, we don't think it was clear that there were 2 categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first before the more expensive standing tickets were released. As a result, many fans may have waited in a long queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide quickly whether to pay a higher price than they expected."
        },
        {
            "text": "Secondly, we\u2019re concerned that Ticketmaster labelled certain seated tickets as \u2018platinum\u2019 and sold them to fans for around 2.5 times the price of equivalent standard tickets, without sufficiently explaining that they didn't offer additional benefits and were often located in the same area of the stadium. We\u2019re concerned that this may have misled fans into thinking they were getting better tickets when that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case."

            "text": "We\u2019re also looking at how \u2018dynamic pricing\u2019 is being used across different sectors of the economy. Dynamic pricing generally involves prices changing in a relatively short period of time because of changing market conditions, like a high level of consumer demand or a shortage of availability. In some cases that can involve complex algorithms, with prices changing frequently and at great speed."
        },
        {
            "text": "There is often considerable confusion about what dynamic pricing is and how it is used. For example, in our Ticketmaster investigation, many fans were under the impression that Ticketmaster used an algorithmic pricing model to adjust its prices in real time. However, we did not find evidence that was the case. Instead, Ticketmaster used a different pricing model where it released a number of standing tickets at a lower price and, once they sold out, released remaining standing tickets at a much higher price."
