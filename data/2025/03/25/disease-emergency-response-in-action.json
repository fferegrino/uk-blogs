Individuals need to make rapid decisions, under pressure, around next steps to ensure any potential incidence of a new disease outbreak is identified and contained as quickly as possible."

Many diseases have similar clinical signs. Simply observing these signs does not give a definitive diagnosis, and so laboratory tests and other evidence is needed to support the ultimate decision of confirmation or giving the all-clear."

The last localised outbreak in the UK was in 2007, and before that, a national outbreak in 2001 cost the country over \u00a314 billion in monetary terms alone, and took over eight months to eradicate."

The National Reference Laboratory for foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) where tests are carried out is based at The Pirbright Institute."

A private vet notified APHA, as they are legally bound to do so, and an official APHA vet went to investigate within a few hours of the report being received. This case became a suspect FMD report case."

By the time I had all the relevant information, it was clear our teams had already taken the action they needed to and were in full control of the situation. The premises concerned was put under precautionary restrictions (no movement of animals, people or materials, and to use disinfectants and enhanced levels of biosecurity) while additional samples could be taken late at night and sent to Pirbright for analysis. All this took place late on a Sunday evening. The repercussions of this decision meant a local livestock market, due to take place on Monday morning, had to be stopped until disease could be negated, so communication began late that evening to make sure any impacts were minimised."

Then we received the initial negative blood result, and while waiting for the full results from the additional samples, teams from across APHA began preparations for any positive results. By the time we had the final negative results, we had sampling teams, valuation suppliers, culling contractors, and disposal solutions poised to roll into action. This was an incredible effort and demonstrates how we stand up when the biosecurity of the UK is under threat."

So, it is \u00a0essential our response is rapid, ensuring we have a grip of the situation in the quickest possible timescales. APHA teams, in particular our vets, are making these decisions day in and day out \u2013 thankfully in this case the disease was negated. But without APHA\u2019s ability for rapid response we would be at greater risk of a disease outbreak occurring and spreading rapidly with far reaching consequences."

Farmers and the public must play their part too. Farmers by practicing good biosecurity and sourcing animals responsibly, the public by observing rules on bringing meat and other products of animal origin into the UK from countries affected by FMD and other animal diseases such as African swine fever and goat and sheep plague."
