            "text": "However, UKHSA would advocate for active DTV research across all families included in the tool (even those with a relative \u201clow\u201d categorization) given the risk of emergence of new pathogens that may represent 'disease X'.\u00a0"

The need for effective diagnostics and therapeutics to identify and treat resistant infections or the need for new vaccines to prevent spread are key reasons why some have been prioritised."
