This is led by intelligence sent to us from garages and the public, and data from assessing MOT garages. This assessment is known as a \u201csite review\u201d \u2013 which can either be onsite or offsite. We\u2019ve done site reviews for many years. It helps us to keep test stations operating as they should and allows us to \u201crisk rate\u201d \u2013 helping us target our efforts at garages that are most likely to have problems. The site review process also provides opportunity for advice and guidance."
