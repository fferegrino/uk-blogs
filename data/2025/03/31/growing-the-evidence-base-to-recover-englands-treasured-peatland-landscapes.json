From the sweeping moors of the Pennines to the ancient heaths and mires of the New Forest, these treasured landscapes are more than just amazing wild spaces to visit. They support farming and other rural communities, and are home to rare and special habitats and species, including habitats that are our most important terrestrial carbon store. About 70% of the UK\u2019s drinking water comes from upland catchments1, where healthy bogs help to store and purify the water supply of surrounding urban populations.\u00a0"

Britain and Ireland are home to about 13% of the global blanket bog resource (see UK Peatland Strategy 2018-2040). Like other peatlands, blanket bogs form when sphagnum mosses and other plant material dies and accumulates in waterlogged conditions. In good condition, blanket bogs continue to accumulate carbon indefinitely and they retain large volumes of water (providing natural flood prevention). Their wet state also makes them more resilient to wildfires.\u00a0\u00a0"
