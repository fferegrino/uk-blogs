It contains recommendations on how to build a user-focused service that involves \u2018applying\u2019 for something. This blog post describes what a service pattern is, how this one was made, how we think it could help design better services, and what we\u2019d like to do next."

            "text": "Designers in government are already familiar with the use of patterns to create digital experiences. Components and patterns usually specify things like the design of a button, a date picker, or multi-page experiences like signing into an account. Using the same patterns in multiple government services can bring many benefits including efficiency, scalability, user experience consistency and improved accessibility.\u00a0"

            "text": "\u2018Service patterns\u2019 take this idea a step further by describing replicable pieces of services that can be combined to build or shape end-to-end services. For example patterns for \u2018apply for something\u2019 and \u2018book an appointment\u2019 could be used to create services to receive a new benefits payment, get a new passport, and many others. A library of service patterns would act as design guides to build services in repeatable and consistent ways."

Below we\u2019ve described the work done at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). We\u2019ll then describe the cross-government work to test how we create service patterns."

To support the \u2018front-to-back\u2019 of service design, we synthesised a wide range of user need evidence, designed service patterns for colleague users, mapped to various components, channels, policy information and organisation goals. We also investigated how service patterns might be published in the DWP Design System."

Five patterns stood out as having the greatest potential for shared needs - \u2018apply\u2019, \u2018appointments\u2019, \u2018get a decision\u2019, \u2018pay\u2019 and \u2018evaluate\u2019.\u00a0"

Participants mapped their service pattern needs against each other\u2019s to identify similarities and variations. The outcome of that workshop is now available as a prototype for review and feedback. The prototype includes user needs, internal business needs, journey stages and steps, and typical user scenarios. We expect a full pattern library to contain other types of information such as recommended digital components and patterns, case studies, and any relevant accessibility concerns.\u00a0\u00a0"
