Every day, we bring expertise, empathy, and commitment to complex situations, ensuring that children are safe and have the best possible outcomes in life.

Yet, it is profoundly rewarding to help children and families stay together, find appropriate support for children, or ensure a child is placed in a loving home."

Many dedicated alternatively qualified practitioners play a crucial role in supporting us to deliver outcomes for children and families. Each role is vital. Without our colleagues, we could not perform our statutory duties effectively, and children and families would not receive the holistic support they need."
