These are mainly aimed at children\u2019s homes and fostering agencies. The changes are intended to encourage more providers to look after children with high or multiple needs."

The changes make it clearer that inspection outcomes will properly reflect practice that improves stability for children."

We published research last year which found that 91% of local authorities said they struggle with this. This often means that some extremely vulnerable children are living in unsuitable provision, far from family and friends. Some children wait months, or even years, for a settled and stable home."
