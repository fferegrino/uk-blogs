Late payments can create serious cash flow problems, making it difficult for businesses to pay suppliers, invest in growth, or even stay afloat. Tackling these delays is central to the Department for Business and Trade\u2019s (DBT) mission to support small business growth and build a resilient economy. As a key ministerial priority for DBT, the Payment Practices Reporting Service plays a vital role in developing a fairer and more sustainable business environment."
