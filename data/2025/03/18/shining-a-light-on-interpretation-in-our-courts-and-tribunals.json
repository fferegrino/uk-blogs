The ability to understand what\u2019s happening and enabling people to communicate clearly is critical to the smooth running of a hearing, and for defendants, interpreters can be vital to receiving a fair trial."

They interpret a huge range of languages from Bantu to Polish, as well as delivering British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation or our obligations under the Welsh Language Act. Interpreters support in-person and remote hearings across the civil, criminal and family courts, and in tribunals."

Many are qualified to degree level in their chosen language, but for some particularly rare languages where qualifications are not available, or there are fewer interpreters, we\u2019re more flexible balancing support for court users with the experts available to work with us."

We\u2019ve accepted all the recommendations made in the review such as providing training to ensure interpreters have the skills they need to support remote hearings effectively."

            "text": "The needs of our users and interpreters are changing, so we\u2019re looking to the future and running a procurement exercise that we expect to complete in 2026 for the provision of language services to take us through to 2030. We currently work with interpreter services organisation TheBigWord need and our own Welsh Language Unit to book Welsh language interpreters. \u00a0to ensure court users can access the interpreters they need. This is because the justice system is complex and finding interpreters for the variety of languages needed to the high standard the justice system demands is rightly time-consuming. If court staff were responsible for this, it would impact the time they have to spend on progressing hearings and supporting judges."

Interpreters will be able to decline bookings that they may find particularly distressing, for example, hearings involving sexual abuse or murder."

            "text": "These plans are very important to us. By supporting interpreters and listening any concerns they raise we\u2019ll continue to ensure anyone \u2013 whether they\u2019re at risk of being evicted, dealing with domestic violence, or involved in a case that relates to children \u2013 can access swifter, effective access to justice through our courts and tribunals."
