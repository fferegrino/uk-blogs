The ScHARR team, which presented encouraging interim results to the UK NSC\u2019s fetal, maternal and child health (FMCH) sub-group in November, is now focusing on completing the model and incorporating stakeholder feedback. Caveats and uncertainties include the cost of treatment, the long-term benefits for children and families and that 2 SMA drug treatments are available under a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) managed access agreement (MAA) at present."

These 6 labs are in a good position to begin testing for SMA and together could test samples from approximately 370,000 births per year. He explained that the ISE would provide a good opportunity to optimise the screening pathway to ensure that the best health outcomes could be gained from treatment.\u00a0 "

Steps needing further clarification include information given at the point of first contact with parents of babies where SMA is suspected, clinical management if SMN2 copy numbers are not available at the first clinical visit and defining where the screening pathway ends and the care pathway takes over. A smaller task and finish group has been working on information for parents and staff training materials. First drafts have been shared for comment with the clinical pathway task and finish group, prior to wider consultation."
