            "text": "It\u2019s small and secretive bird which, arguably, a lot of people won\u2019t have heard of let alone been lucky enough to see. So, I consider myself extremely lucky to be leading a project to understand its habits and movements. "

            "text": "Breeding in northern Eurasia, Jack Snipe are a winter visitor to the UK, being present mostly from September to April. They prefer marshes, wet grasslands and the muddy fringes of reedbeds, but will also feed overnight in fields of short grass or stubble, feeding feasting on insects, worms and snails."

            "text": "An estimated 110,000 Jack Snipe\u00a0winter across the UK, making them one of our most widespread and numerous visitors, but due to their secretive and nocturnal nature this population estimate is deemed unreliable. However, with Natural England\u2019s input and advancing technology, our understanding of them is improving.\u00a0"

            "text": "From 2000 to 2015, on average fewer than 120 Jack Snipes were caught and ringed across the UK each year. With the advent of thermal imaging cameras making detection of birds both during the day and night much easier, the annual average of birds ringed has since increased to over 420, with a record 738 in 2023. However, up to 2023, just 121 birds had been recaught and only 21 of those abroad. So, very little is known about their migration routes and choice of stopover sites."

Both birds roosted each day at the same site, but they visited two or three different feeding areas, visiting the same field(s) for up to four nights in a row, before visiting another area and sometimes returning to a previous field on a later night. "

            "text": "In December 2024, we recaught another tagged bird - this time one that had migrated to its breeding grounds and returned to winter in Staffordshire. Unfortunately, the tag battery failed on the bird\u2019s outward migration, but it did reveal for the first time the migration route of a UK Jack Snipe."

        {
            "text": "Having wintered in south Staffordshire, regularly roosting at the same wetland (occasionally elsewhere and once on Cannock Chase) and feeding in local grass and stubble fields, it flew overnight in mid-April to a wetland in Essex."

            "text": "The next day it had flown to Germany and the day after that to Poland, having flown over 1,000km in three days. It stayed there for a further 15 days, rebuilding its energy reserves, before flying to another site in Poland and two locations in Latvia by the end of the next day, when the signal was lost. The bird was still migrating and would no doubt have continued north-eastwards into Russia."
