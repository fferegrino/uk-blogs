This doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t look at young carers in the other 10 inspections. We report on strengths and areas for improvement, so sometimes things may have just been \u2018middling\u2019 or \u2018okay\u2019 so we wouldn\u2019t go into as much detail."

            "text": "We saw a comprehensive support offer for young carers through a range of activities, groups and one-to-one sessions. This helps young people understand their own needs alongside the needs of the person they are caring for and provides time away from their caring tasks. Senior leaders have strategies that have improved how they identify and support young carers."

            "text": "In some local authorities, increasing numbers of young carers benefit from innovative, holistic early help provided through family hubs. These hubs offer a wide range of early help tailored to the specific needs of children and their families. Young carers receive bespoke individual support alongside group work, allowing them to meet others with similar experiences and share their views with council leaders. Assessments are tailored to the needs of young carers, whatever their age. Professionals understand and address their specific situations."

            "text": "Young carers are supported by a range of professionals, including social workers and youth engagement workers, who provide timely and effective support.

        {
            "text": "Some support services for young carers are underdeveloped, which leads to inconsistencies in the quality and availability of support. There is a lack of awareness of young carers, and this means they are sometimes not identified. If children with caring responsibilities are not recognised as young carers, they cannot receive the support they need."

            "text": "Due to increased demand, some families experience delays in receiving support. This can leave young carers without the help they need for long periods. Some children are left at risk because their needs have not been assessed well enough, which means those needs are not met."

            "text": "Many of these local authority children\u2019s services recognise that they need a cultural change in order to create the best conditions for effective practice and support for young carers. Inspection has a part to play but ultimately the responsibilities sit with local authorities to support young carers well."
