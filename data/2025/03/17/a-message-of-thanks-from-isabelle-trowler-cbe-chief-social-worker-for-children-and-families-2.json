            "text": "Firstly, one of the most important messages to give this week and across the year, is a huge thanks to you all for everything you do. I have seen some amazing practice over the last year, and everyone is working so hard - your commitment and the ambition you hold for children, young people and their families, always, always, shines through."

            "text": "The last 12 months has been a big year on all fronts for social workers. We\u2019ve seen a general election, a new government, and a new Children\u2019s Minister (who was previously a social worker!). It has also brought a key focus on reducing child poverty and supporting family stability, plus new money for local authorities which is ring-fenced for prevention work with families. You should know that this is all a result of the very encouraging social work practice across England over recent years. "

            "text": "We are also seeing better workforce recruitment and retention with more social workers in permanent posts, lower caseloads, and fewer vacancies. This is for the second year running so we have our fingers crossed that this shift will continue in the years ahead. So much of that best practice is now also enshrined in the new statutory Children\u2019s Social Care National Framework, which gives absolute clarity of purpose to children\u2019s social care, but also what you need to enable you to do the social work you came into the profession to do - strong, practice-focused leadership, a strong workforce, and effective multi-agency contributions."

There will be a consultation on this so do share your thoughts with the Department for Education (DfE)!"

            "text": "I met with some of the National Principal Social Worker Network in early March at their in-person meeting and will meet the network again on the 18 March with the Centre for Sexual Abuse. It\u2019s really important that you get your views to your Principal Social Worker for them to share at a network meeting. Even if I\u2019m not there, my colleagues from the DfE always are and they are very keen to get your perspectives, too! I\u2019ll be meeting soon with Principal Social Workers in the West Midlands to chat through their thoughts and work towards the Children\u2019s Social Care reform programme. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting into the discussion. "

We have decided to do some work together to help bridge the gap between practitioners and senior leaders. I think all in all, we are held in good stead for the year ahead."
