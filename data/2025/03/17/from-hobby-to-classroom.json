This feeds into getting buy in from whoever's playing the game.\u00a0Being able to explain and get people to understand what they're doing is helpful in the future is a core skill.\u00a0I feel like I'm going down the softer side of things than Steven does. Its people skills, people management and also understanding the softer side of social science, bringing in sociology and anthropology."

Defence has obviously been the one where it's been present for the longest, but we're seeing a resurgence again in terms of interest and in what it can do and how it can add value. Equally, we're also seeing a greater level of interest outside of Defence, particularly in business wargaming.\u00a0I think the expansion beyond the Defence field is probably one of the biggest trends I've seen in the last few years."

We're seeing a lot more academic engagement with wargaming. I think that is going to drive a significant community of interest within academia. I think we'll see more experimental wargaming happening at a number of different institutions, driving the idea of it as a research methodology and giving wargaming more academic rigour."

New approaches to rigour like ways of ensuring that your results are going to be valid. So overall, I\u2019d say professional standards in the form of more handbooks. This would benefit from academic collaboration, of course, but also increased international collaborations."

The first is\u00a0Operation Overlord Normandy\u00a0because I\u2019ve spent hours playing it with friends. I find it really interesting the impact a single change could have had on the outcome of the operation, for example, the weather. For instance, if it was poor weather meaning no allied air support, then the Germans could have completely stopped the Canadian and British armies. The other game is the\u00a0Counterinsurgency series on Cyprus. For a similar reason, it's a point of history I don't know as much about but being able to identify some of those core principles of counterinsurgency and how you can enact them, in a hobby environment, is really fascinating. It adds an extra level of enjoyment to be able to go \u2018oh, OK, this is why this stuff happens\u2019.\u00a0"

This isn't saying Defence is bad at this, I just think introducing a new concept to force change quickly is always a difficult challenge; you need buy in. I was having a conversation with someone the other week and they were saying they don't see history and historical games as being useful in shaping future context, I sort of bit my tongue quite strongly at that point."

And is the design nourishing this goal? That's the validation. I think we have a lot to collaborate on that front and finding the right way to communicate that to your customers."

Other than that, I think just play games. Playing is a core part of this because the more you play, the more you can critically appraise what you're playing; and the more you can understand what's needed to go into that game design process and how you can draw people in, keeping people interested in what you're doing.\u00a0"
