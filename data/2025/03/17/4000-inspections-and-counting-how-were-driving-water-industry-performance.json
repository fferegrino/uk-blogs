At the heart of our plan was a significant increase in both our workforce and the number of inspections we carry out. We have achieved both; exceeding our target of 4000 inspections for the year to the end of March and recruiting hundreds of specialist staff."

Over the past five years, it\u2019s been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.

We are here to ensure they do what the public expect them to do."

Our approach is to look at the whole regulatory cycle combining increased inspections and more enforcement action using a broader range of powers, along with new digital tools. This combination we\u2019ll be able to deliver meaningful improvements in water industry performance, hold persistent offenders to account and ultimately see a cleaner water environment."

This can result in problems and failures not happening in the first place. Our intelligence will feed into new statutory Drainage and Wastewater Management Plans which set out how companies plan to extend, improve and maintain a robust and resilient drainage and wastewater system over the next 25 years. They will be key in enabling growth by delivering capacity ahead of time as we face pressures from climate change and urban creep and a growing population."
