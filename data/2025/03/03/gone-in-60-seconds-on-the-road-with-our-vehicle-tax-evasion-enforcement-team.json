Our campaign slogan felt appropriate here: \u2018hard to hide, easy to tax\u2019. The van was clamped within 60 seconds and the owner had to tax the van and pay a release fee \u2013 a cost that could have been avoided if the vehicle keeper had kept their vehicle taxed."

This 20-year-old car had been abandoned on a residential street and the lift drew a small crowd of intrigued residents who were all too happy to see it gone. The car was in great condition for its age (except for its vehicle tax status), and so off it went on a MINI adventure to the pound."
