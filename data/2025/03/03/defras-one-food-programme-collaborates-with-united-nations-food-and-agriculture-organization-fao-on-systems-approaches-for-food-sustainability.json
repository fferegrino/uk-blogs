The aim of the workshop was to identify opportunities for collaboration between One Food and FAO\u2019s development of a Multi-Hazard Dashboard for early warning of threats to food security."

The programme, which includes 21 UK, South African and global partners drawn from government, academia and non-profit, is organised around three main themes of \u2018food system evidence\u2019, a \u2018One Food Risk Tool\u2019 and \u2018enabling change\u2019. The programme has been developing and testing the themes in South Africa and the workshop is a natural extension of this, working with FAO to explore how the tools and knowledge can have impact long-term at a global level."

            "text": "The workshop gave the opportunity to present the One Food approach and its principles of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. One of the central outputs of the programme is the \u2018One Food Risk Tool\u2019, a whole-system risk assessment tool, developed on the template of the earlier Seafood Risk Tool, which seeks to estimate the impact of all hazards (i.e. problems) acting on, or created by, food systems. The tool considers chemical, biological, physical and socio-economic hazards along different stages of the food value chain, across all food sectors. This allows the relative risk of hazards to be compared, actively embracing trade-offs and, in doing so, facilitating collective decisions on priority interventions."

The report will soon be published on the One Food Community platform and will form the basis for future developments."

            "text": "What clearly emerged from the workshop was that the One Food Risk Tool and FAO Multi-Hazard Dashboard are strongly complementary; the hazard dashboard will provide a country/global snapshot of current presence and extent of animal, plant and environment health hazards, whereas the One Food Risk tool provides an assessment of the impacts of these hazards and identification of suitable mitigation strategies. Both One Food and the Multi-Hazard Dashboard are targeting ambitious goals and the group exchanged insights on challenges, successes, and best practices, focusing on optimising synergies between the initiatives as a means to address the complex interconnections between food, ecosystems, climate change and society."

FAO\u2019s commitment to secure and sustainable food is fully evident in their ethos, from food waste measurement and hydroponics in the nutrition-positive canteen to the programmes of work they presented on hazard early warning and climate-driven food loss. In times of uncertainty, it is gratifying to see Defra-funded research align with and support FAO\u2019s global efforts to feed the planet well and the collaboration with both the FAO and the South African government assures us that the One Food programme is having tangible impact."
