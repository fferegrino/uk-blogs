Early diagnosis is essential for the most successful outcome."

An array of factors such as awareness and geographical access to healthcare services, language and cultural barriers, and lack of support to attend screening appointments can all play a part. They also experience difficulties self-administering treatment and attending follow-up appointments. Consequently, 25% of individuals with TB and social risk factors do not complete treatment within the expected duration."
