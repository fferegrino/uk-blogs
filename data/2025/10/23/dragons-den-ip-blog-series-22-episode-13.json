From wrestling entertainment to tattoo care, educational gaming and house-sharing solutions, the Den was packed with innovation and tech ventures at every turn.\u00a0"

            "text": "After a tense and exciting wrestle, Andrew pitched what he described as 'the ultimate variety show' \u2013 a ticket-selling business that also finds success on social media. The pitch was filled with nostalgia as he shared tales of childhood wrestling matches with his dad. The entrepreneur and his business certainly packed an impressive punch.\u00a0"

The balm is also in a stick form, making it convenient for application on the go. While Fiona doesn't have any tattoos herself, she entered the Den with a promise that should the Dragons invest in her product, she would get a dragon tattoo herself!\u00a0"

Fiona claimed that she wants to become the go-to product for tattoo aftercare. She asked the Dragons for \u00a360,000 in exchange for 15% of her business to help achieve this goal.\u00a0"
