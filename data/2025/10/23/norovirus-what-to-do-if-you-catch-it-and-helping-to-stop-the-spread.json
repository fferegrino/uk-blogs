It spreads easily through communities, making outbreaks common in settings where individuals have close contact such as hospitals, care homes, schools and nurseries."

            "text": "The virus infects the stomach and intestines, and is also known as a gastrointestinal virus. You can catch norovirus more than once in a short time period because multiple types (or genotypes) of norovirus circulate at any given time. You may develop limited immunity to one strain but can still be infected by a different one soon after."

You should stay at home and avoid preparing food for others until 48 hours after symptoms have completely stopped, as you may still be shedding the virus during this time."

However, some groups - including young children, the elderly or those with weakened immunity - are at risk of suffering more serious and prolonged illness, which may require medical treatment."

It is important to properly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces using a bleach-based solution (chlorine), wearing disposable gloves where possible. The typical recommendation is to use a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution (i.e. 1,000 parts per million (ppm)) for surfaces."

The focus of treatment is preventing dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, as vomiting and diarrhoea cause your body to lose water and salts. Elderly people, young children and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of becoming dehydrated and may need medical treatment."

The term \u2018stomach flu\u2019 is misleading - it's simply a common nickname for inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The seasonal flu is caused by influenza viruses, which are completely different from norovirus and primarily affect the nose, mouth, lungs and airways rather than the digestive system. Norovirus is a gastrointestinal virus."

The distinction is important because the incorrect use of \u2018Kawasaki virus\u2019 has caused confusion with \u2018Kawasaki disease,\u2019 which is an unrelated, very serious condition."
