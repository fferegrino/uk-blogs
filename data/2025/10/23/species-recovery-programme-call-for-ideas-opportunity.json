Historically, this includes the cirl bunting and large blue butterfly, and more recently it has contributed to conservation efforts for species such as the turtle dove and fen orchid."

It delivers tailored interventions for species that need targeted, species-specific action. These interventions are among those published in the Threatened Species Recovery Actions dataset which serves as the evidence base for the programme."

These updates will give the opportunity to also correct errors and review new information relating to species populations and the actions required. \u00a0"

In such cases, we may consider part-funding contributions and encouraging partners to utilise match funding to secure longer-term projects."
