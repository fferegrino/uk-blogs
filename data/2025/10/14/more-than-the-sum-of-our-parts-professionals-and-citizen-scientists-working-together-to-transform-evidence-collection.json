In recent years, the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme has allowed us to create and upgrade maps and data products like the England Peat Map and Living England habitat map \u2013 crucial for giving us the large-scale overview of our landscapes and natural resources that we so urgently need. But the vast majority of the environmental evidence we have available in the UK, and the biggest army of surveyors, comes neither from Natural England employees, nor from universities, nor from ecological consultancies."
