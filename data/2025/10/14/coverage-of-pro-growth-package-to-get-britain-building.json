This is on top of granting new powers for ministers to prevent applications being rejected by local councils while they consider using \u2018call-in\u2019 powers to decide whether they should be approved. There is also further coverage in Housing Today, Construction Enquirer and ENDS Report reporting about the new amendments."

It is simply not true that nature has to lose for economic growth to succeed.\u00a0\u201cSluggish planning has real world consequences. Every new house blocked deprives a family of a home. Every infrastructure project that gets delayed blocks someone from a much-needed job. This will now end.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe changes we are making today will strengthen the seismic shift already underway through our landmark Bill. We will \u2018Build, baby, build\u2019 with 1.5 million new homes and communities that working people desperately want and need.\u201d"
