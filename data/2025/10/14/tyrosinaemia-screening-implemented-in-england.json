It affects about 7 babies per year in the UK and leads to the build-up of toxic substances that damage the liver, kidneys, and nervous system."

            "text": "Evidence reviewed by the UK NSC found that screening will help detect these babies in time for them to be offered drug treatment and a special diet before becoming ill. These are life-changing benefits that significantly reduce the risk of long-term complications and symptoms such as poor weight gain, jaundice, an enlarged liver, bleeding, and bruising, which can lead to liver and kidney damage.\u00a0"

A UK NSC oversight group and expert clinical and laboratory sub-groups helped lay the groundwork with collaboration between NBS screening laboratories, maternity services, specialist doctors and dieticians. It has also required a change in the testing methodology for IMD screening."
