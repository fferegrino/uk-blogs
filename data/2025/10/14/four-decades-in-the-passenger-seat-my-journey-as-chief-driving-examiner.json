It was quite a year to start my journey with what would become the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). And I suspect more people are still talking about EastEnders!\u00a0"

The difference this has made to road safety can\u2019t be overstated. Previously, a newly qualified driver's first motorway experience could be daunting, even frightening. Now they can develop those crucial high-speed driving skills \u2013 joining and leaving carriageways, lane discipline, and safe overtaking \u2013 in a controlled environment, with the help and supervision of a professional driving instructor.\u00a0\u00a0"

It showed me first-hand how quickly government and the Civil Service can act when decisive action is needed. The initiatives we implemented significantly increased the number of vocational driving tests \u2013 allowing industry to recruit more lorry drivers. This demonstrated the power of focused, collaborative effort.\u00a0"
