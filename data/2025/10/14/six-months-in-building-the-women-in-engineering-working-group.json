I am relatively new to the Civil Service and wasn\u2019t exactly sure what a working group should look like outside of academia. Imposter syndrome was of course rife and the purpose of the group, to get more women into technical engineering roles, is not an insignificant task. We settled on what might seem like a simple goal: increase the number of women and non-binary people in technical roles. We deliberately chose to measure this in actual numbers rather than percentages, because percentages can be misleading when teams are growing and changing. It's easier to track progress when you're saying \"we had 20, now we have 40\" rather than getting tangled up in shifting denominators.\u00a0"

            "text": "The decision to keep things intimate initially was important, and frankly, necessary. When you're talking about diversity issues, you're inevitably going to touch on some painful experiences. People need to feel safe sharing moments that might have knocked their confidence, or recounting times when they felt overlooked or undervalued. You can't create that environment overnight, especially when many of us had never worked together before. So, we kept the group small and for the moment don't admit new members - adding people would have altered that foundation of trust, and too many voices, introductions and recaps of ground rules could have meant less action in the short timeframes we have.\u00a0"

The lack of diversity in engineering is a systemic, cultural issue that goes far beyond what one working group can tackle. We're not going to suddenly convince more women to study computer science at university or A-levels, and we're not going to single-handedly shift decades of workplace culture overnight.\u00a0"

Justice Digital is a sprawling organisation with people in all sorts of roles, and role titles that don't always tell you what someone actually does day-to-day.

In our discussions, it became clear that women in technical teams often end up doing more work - not the glamorous kind, but the essential emotional labour that keeps teams functioning.\u00a0This might be facilitating meetings, managing difficult conversations, or making space for everyone to contribute. It's exhausting work that requires real skill, but it's often invisible and unrewarded.\u00a0"

Civil service requirements rightly call for diverse panels, but when teams have limited representation, such as few women, the same individuals are often called upon repeatedly. It\u2019s additional work that should be recognised and supported appropriately. Panels should reflect the diversity they aim to promote, without placing a disproportionate burden on a few.\u00a0"
