GOV.UK Chat is a pilot tool that uses relevant website content to generate responses, aiming to simplify navigation across more than 700,000 pages on GOV.UK and help users find the information they need. Feedback from testing with hundreds of users suggested a preference for GOV.UK Chat over traditional search and navigation methods. This highlighted the convenience of direct question-answering systems, particularly for users with more complex questions."

A centralised content store including guidance, lesson plans, and anonymised pupil assessments is being used to train AI models to produce high-quality, accurate, and legally compliant educational tools tailored to schools. 16 education technology providers are using the content store to develop AI-powered tools for teachers, supported by \u00a31 million in Innovate UK funding. Early tests by the Department for Education show that supplying generative AI models with targeted educational data can increase accuracy to 92%, compared to 67% without such data."

An example is a world-leading trial to tackle breast cancer to research how multiple cutting-edge AI tools can be used in the breast cancer screening pathway, with almost 700,000 women across the country taking part. If the trial is successful, it could free up hundreds of radiologists and other specialists to see more patients. This will help tackle rising cancer rates, save more lives, and cut waiting lists."

User research is summarised using a large language model (LLM), with summaries reviewed and edited by users. This makes user research more easily findable and visible. It can save considerable time for user researchers and minimise the risk that relevant user research is neglected or work is duplicated."

For example, the Government Communication Service developed \u2018Assist\u2019 - a tool built by government communicators, for government communicators. Over 5,800 communicators are now using Assist, with users saving 3 hours a week on average. This is equivalent to annual productivity savings of over \u00a37.5 million."

For example, Swindon Borough Council is using Simply Readable, an AI-powered tool to generate Easy-Read documents. Co-created with residents with learning disabilities, it features larger fonts, clear language, increased spacing, and supporting visuals to meet real user needs. This reduced the cost of creating 5-10 page documents from \u00a3600 to circa 7-10 pence."
