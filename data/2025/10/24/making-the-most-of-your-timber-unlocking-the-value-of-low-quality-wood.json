Getting professional advice at this stage is always valuable, and the UK Forest Industry Safety Accord (FISA) provides excellent technical guidance on best practice in forest operations which can help get you started.You also need to adhere to standards and certifications surrounding wood products before you can sell them. This particularly applies to wood being used for fuel, such as ensuring your firewood is certified as \u2018Ready to Burn\u2019 as specified in the Air Quality (Domestic Solid Fuels Standards) (England) Regulations 2020."
