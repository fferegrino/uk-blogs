This blog highlights the impact of the British Library\u2019s recent Unearthed: The Power of Gardening exhibition in libraries across the UK. Libraries have always been places of discovery and dialogue and are powerful catalysts for curiosity and creativity. This exhibition has reaffirmed the impact of cultural programming in libraries as an effective way to meaningfully engage people to take action on climate change, in the places where they live.\u00a0"

It featured a range of sustainable exhibition practices, building on previous work by the Library to reduce its emissions, including the reusing of exhibition cases, use of bio-based display material (timber, water-based paints, cork), working with sustainability-conscious designers, minimising travel impacts of loan items, and reducing waste. A partnership with local charity Global Generation planted a new wildflower meadow in the Poet\u2019s Circle on the Library\u2019s public Piazza.\u00a0"
