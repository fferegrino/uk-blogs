When in a healthy state, peatlands provide multiple benefits - absorbing carbon, regulating our water supply, creating a home for wildlife and providing a record of the past.\u00a0 Wet, restored peatlands can also be more resilient to wildfires, as explained by our Chief Scientist, Sallie Bailey, in her blog \u2018Wildfires: Nature\u2019s role in resisting the spark\u2019."

We agree that burning should be seen as a last resort, on those sites where other means of vegetation management (where such management is proven necessary), are not feasible or appropriate.\u00a0 Our view is that blanket bog and other peatland habitats should require little to no long-term management if they are in good ecological condition."

In addition, there are known incidences of damage and disturbance to finite archaeological remains and it may cause peat compaction.\u00a0 We would therefore caution against promoting cutting as a universally suitable alternative to burning."

            "text": "Natural England response: Our Definition of Favourable Conservation Status for Blanket Bog (March 2025), used as evidence to support this consultation question, provides a full explanation behind the 30cm definition.\u00a0 In summary, evidence to justify a definition of peat of 30cm or more (which supports blanket bog habitat) is widely adopted across Europe. This depth is based on ecological factors rather than the previous post-war 40cm definition (used in the 2021 regs) which was based on the exploitation potential of peat. Peat forms wherever waterlogging prevents complete decomposition of dead plant matter. As such, any accumulation of such waterlogged material can be classed as \u2018peat\u2019. A thickness of 30cm or more is also recognised as a useful threshold for blanket bog plant species.\u00a0 We agree that \u2013 by lowering the regulatory threshold to include peat deeper than 30cm \u2013 this will increase the amount of peat and associated habitats protected from burning and enable their hydrological function to be restored. \u00a0Once restored to a healthy functioning state, peatland habitats will make a vital contribution to the Government\u2019s Net Zero and EIP targets \u2013 storing carbon, improving water quality and helping protect communities from flooding."

Natural England is only likely to consider a licence application on land it owns (National Nature Reserves) under the ground (a). This will only be in situations where there is evidence that, having considered all other alternative management interventions, it will accelerate habitat restoration efforts. In such cases we would also need to conclude that the burn is directly connected with or necessary for the management of the habitat for which the site has been designated."

A gradual advancement of mean egg laying dates may also be further influenced by climate change. We therefore suggest moving the end date back to 31 March (as in Wales) or align with Countryside Stewardship\u2019s mandatory prescription for CUP3 (P441).\u00a0 This uses a 5th March date, after which operations with potential to disturb birds are prohibited. \u00a0"

In addition, subsurface burning can affect buried archaeology and paleoecology.\u00a0 Vehicle access in an emergency (e.g. wildfire response) is another potential cause of archaeological damage.\u00a0 We recommend that amended regulations include reference to the historic environment, in line with the [Heather and Grass Management] Code."

Extended Regulation may decrease the number of burning pressures on our protected sites. Burning has negative effects on the hydrology of blanket peat and areas subject to burning are at risk of not recovering good structure and function."
