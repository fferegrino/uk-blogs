            "text": "Have you ever started cooking something and got distracted? I certainly have, thankfully with no serious consequences. According to Dr Samuel Bailey, the first entrepreneur to enter the Den this week, the UK fire service responded to more than 10,500 cooking fires last year, accounting for just under half of the UK\u2019s house fires. Frightening."

            "text": "London-based Sam came into the Den asking for an investment of \u00a3100k for 5% of the equity in his tech company, Pippa Technologies, as well as expertise to help him fire up interest in new markets. His passion for inventing household items that protect people, was evident when he demonstrated \u2018Pippa\u2019, his AI-powered hob and stove safety monitor. His vision is to see the device installed in millions of homes worldwide."

        {
            "text": "So how does Pippa work? This smart, wall-mounted, AI-powered invention uses software that Sam developed himself, to detect potential kitchen hazards. The clever kit registers when cooking oil approaches peak temperature, for example, and can detect food on fire within 20-30 seconds. It can also monitor risk, identifying when people become accident prone in the kitchen, and a danger to themselves. Once the danger is discovered, Pippa can sound a warning, using phone and text messages to raise the alarm. Impressed? So were the Dragons."

            "text": "Sam revealed how his PhD in computer science, combined with his mission to make life better, has led him to invent a number of solutions that help with safety and sustainability in the home. Developed through his other, more established company, Skyrad, these include a renewable energy heating system with a low carbon footprint, and \u2018leak bot\u2019 technology that detects leaks around the home."

With their eyes firmly set on the bigger picture, Peter, Deborah and Touker Suleyman expressed an interest in investing not in Pippa Technologies, but in Skyrad. Sam seemed flattered, indicating that he was happy to talk details."

The negotiation that followed led to a hot result for both entrepreneur and investors: a 5% stake in return for \u00a350K each from Peter, Deborah and Touker \u2013 a total of \u00a3150k for Dr Sam."

Bethan was inspired by her desire to find a tasty alternative to water when pregnant - a treat rather than a trade-off. She created her feelgood aperitif using ginger and cider vinegar as base ingredients, a refreshing combination known traditionally as a \u2018switchel\u2019. From the friendly fracas between Deborah and Sara over the sample drinks, it was obvious that Bethan was onto a winner with the demographic in the Den."

            "text": "This resonated with the Dragons: \u201cI completely get it!\u201d said Steven Bartlett, who didn\u2019t disguise his excitement at hearing the Mother Root pitch. As a drinker of non-alcoholic drinks himself, he told of his frequent hunt for something interesting to drink on a night out. Deborah loved it too, equally excited at the prospect of having a choice.

Finally though, it was Steven, with his two market performance businesses and love of the concept, for whom Mother Root resonated the most. \u00a0"
