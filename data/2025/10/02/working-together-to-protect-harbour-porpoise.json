            "text": "For those who work at sea, Harbour porpoises are a familiar sight around our coast. They have a wide diet, feeding mostly on fish, including sandeels, herring and whiting, as well as on squid and crustaceans. As predators they help to regulate and balance fish stocks. This means they play a key role in maintaining a healthy and functioning marine ecosystem, which benefits fishers and the seafood industry."

            "text": "But evidence suggests that accidental capture of harbour porpoise, known as bycatch, is happening at unsustainable levels, which could be impacting the condition of two key marine protected areas (MPAs), the Southern North Sea MPA and the Bristol Channel Approaches MPA."
