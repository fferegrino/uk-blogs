We were a pretty disparate bunch, scattered across different projects, and day-to-day interactions were few and far between. As it is everywhere in digital teams, everyone was very busy and we weren\u2019t sure how a few extra meetings would change that. It\u2019s not that we were against the concept in principle, but we had both been involved in variations of these groups before and almost universally over time the energy has wavered, attendance has waned, and the community has ultimately fizzled out."

            "text": "One of the best decisions at our first away day in Bristol was to share the weight of running the community. We agreed to set up a rolling leadership approach where different team members take turns steering activities and different members of the team would lead sessions in a community council. This meant that no one person carried the responsibility, and everyone could bring their own style, experience, and ideas to the table."

            "text": "In for a penny in for a pound, we both put our hands up and volunteered to go first as the two community leaders. We\u2019re glad that we did! As the community grew, we realised it was the perfect place to define our collective vision for product across Defra Digital Data Technology and Security (DDTS)."

        {
            "text": "During early community sessions, we talked about what we stood for, what we wanted to achieve, and even designed 'mission patches' to celebrate our identity. Framing the first few away days and sessions around what product is, the challenges we faced and what we wanted it to be proved a powerful and fun way to connect."

        {
            "text": "We also carried out a team skills audit. Importantly this was not as a performance check, but as a way of identifying where we could grow together. It helped us focus on what we were good at and the skills we wanted to strengthen collectively, rather than leaving personal development as a purely individual responsibility. It was also a great process to hold communally as it served to demystify who might be the best person to turn to in the team when we inevitably get stuck on a topic during the day to day!"

        {
            "text": "We started by opening our doors to guest speakers from across DDTS, departments and even beyond government; giving us fresh perspectives and sparking ideas we wouldn\u2019t have necessarily thought of ourselves. As the team has grown it has helped us understand perspectives from across the delivery function, and stay current on key topics across the industry more broadly."

        {
            "text": "It\u2019s given a sense of belonging to something more tangible to members, whilst providing a great foundation to those that have joined it in a period of growth. New starters know that we\u2019re here, where to turn for support, and perhaps more importantly they can see that they\u2019re part of a team."
