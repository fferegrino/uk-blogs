With the government's commitment to delivering 1.5 million homes by 2029, local plans play an essential role in enabling plan-led development. Our projections show 147 \u00a0additional plans expected for submission between now and the end of 2026 \u2013 a dramatic increase from the 18 plans we examined in 2023/24."

            "text": "This step change in demand has prompted us to think differently about how we support local authorities through the examination process. It's not just about managing our own resources \u2013 though we've significantly expanded our inspector base and continue recruiting \u2013 it's about working collaboratively to ensure plans arrive ready for examination."

            "text": "The Minister of State's letter of 30 July 2024 was, in many ways, a game changer. It raised the bar for plan quality at submission, making clear that local planning authorities must not submit plans unless \u00a0they're genuinely ready for independent examination. The presumption that inspectors will use significant time and resources to 'fix' fundamental problems during examinations is no longer acceptable."

            "text": "This isn't about being less supportive \u2013 quite the opposite. It's about being smarter in how we channel that support to where it can be most effective: during plan preparation rather than when it\u2019s too late."

Legal compliance, including the duty to cooperate, remains absolutely critical \u2013 and it's the one thing an inspector legally cannot remedy for you during examination. The four tests of soundness continue to be the benchmark against which all plans are assessed."

            "text": "However, we're seeing recurring issues: inadequate consideration of alternatives in sustainability appraisals, unresolved duty to cooperate problems, unrealistic delivery assumptions, and poor integration between evidence and policies. These are preventable problems, but they require attention during plan preparation, not at examination."
