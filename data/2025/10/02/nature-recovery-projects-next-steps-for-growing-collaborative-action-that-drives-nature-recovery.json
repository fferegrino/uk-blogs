Covering over 319,480ha, these projects were designed to turbo drive collaborative action for nature recovery at scale, aimed at restoring entire ecosystems. This has made them a driver in growing a network of bigger, better, joined-up wildlife-rich places that counters biodiversity loss, climate change and improves access to nature."

Its focus has been the restoration of habitat within 21,000ha affected by mining and the china clay industry in mid-Cornwall. The project connects nature reserves such as Goss Moor NNR and a suite of Cornwall Wildlife Trust (CWT) reserves. Over 5,000 hectares of habitat and 18km of Cornish hedge has been restored or created for nature. The partnership has worked on species resilience, successfully improving habitats for dormice, marsh fritillary butterflies and willow tit and plans to sequester CO\u2082\u00a0through wetland restoration. Research and development undertaken has led to the discovery of the largest seagrass bed in Cornwall. As a direct consequence of work undertaken on the NRP, CWT have received Heritage Lottery Funding for a 5-year project to extend work undertaken on nature recovery in the area. Tor-to-Shore strengthens the existing partnership of which Natural England continues to be a part."

Collaborative work with landowners and Catchment Sensitive Farming colleagues has led to a survey of invertebrate pollinator species with the Bumblebee Trust, showing the benefits of herbals leys for pollinator species when compared with perennial ryegrass silage fields.\u00a0 Collaborating with the county council and local authorities, the \u2018Wye Valley Roadside Verges Survey\u2019 investigated the use of the roadside verge network as wildlife corridors. Forecasting of potential carbon and biodiversity net gain (BNG) credits has shaped the development of two 30-year management plans and research looking at the potential application of BNG with the Wildlife Trust. Solar mapping has identified potential climate refugia within the dales with dew ponds, important for great crested newts, restored. Within the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve, the River Lathkill Restoration Plan is providing an analysis of restoration opportunities for 6.5km of the river over 13 reaches alongside underground survey work.

New wetland features have been successfully colonised by rare Lesser Silver Diving Beetle and Great Crested Newt. The installation of 12 eel passes help this critically endangered species to move and thrive in a changing climate. New monitoring techniques are being trialled, including audio recorders and thermal imaging cameras on drones to identify and locate bird species and nesting locations. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) market analysis has enabled Somerset County Council to plan for the implementation of BNG policy."

Core partners have formed an independent consultancy focused on green finance, to assist delivery. A conservation covenant with responsible authority and RSK, is providing nutrient credits from taking arable land out of production.

An interactive database has been developed to identify target areas, restore woodland, peatland and species, alongside a deer management strategy. \u00a0Blended finance opportunities have been identified through engagement with Highways England and Landscape Connections. Research into grazing options for moorland mosaics has led to the development of a Countryside Stewardship proposal which will improve 4,600ha of habitat in a key NRP linkage area. This will result in improved management of 40ha of limestone grassland, the enhancement of dry heath and blanket bog over 4,000ha and the creation of 50ha of scrub. East of Eden funded research has resulted in the development of a partnership project on a 1,500m stretch of the River Eden which will resolve river erosion and enhance habitat through natural flood management. Research into bird populations, tree planting and grazing management is informing agri-environment proposals across the project area."

Joining up at landscape scale will enhance land management, improve climate resilience, prevent flooding and improve access to green space. Research is informing action required for key priority species, including Purple Milk Vetch, Water Vole, European Eel, Native Wild Oyster, Blue Mussel and Seagrass. An investible proposition in development with the RSPB will restore a natural waterway within 100ha of former arable land at \u2018Wild Saltholme\u2019. This new wetland habitat will benefit waders and waterfowl listed within the SPA/RAMSAR.

The NRP has led to the declaration of a new \u2018super\u2019 National Nature Reserve, Wealden Heaths, spanning 2,765ha across nine partner organisations. Species work includes the development of a Heathland Code to encourage responsible behaviour during ground nesting bird season, and an action plan supporting the recovery of amphibians and reptiles. Research undertaken includes ecohydrological surveys, BNG, visitors and the mapping of priority habitats."

New projects and partnerships are promoting accessible green spaces at Wythenshawe Hospital. Working with children and young adults in deprived boroughs of South Manchester has led to the development of activities in local green spaces for children and young people. The partnership is supporting the Bollin Valley Group/Cheshire Landscapes Group to develop a Landscape Recovery Round 3 bid. It is also enabling the South Manchester Urban Brooks partnership to bring together un-fundable fragmented sites into a single portfolio of fundable projects. This has involved drawing together information on baseline habitats, Green Finance readiness, delivery readiness, alignment with draft Local Nature Recovery Strategy measures, and assessments of ecosystem services. Manchester, which overlaps with the NRP, and nearby Salford have been successful in securing Nature Towns and Cities funding, aimed at connecting urban nature."

Many of the NRPs will become partner-led initiatives, fulfilling their purpose as evolved, self-sufficient projects. These NRPs will continue to lead the way in demonstrating how place-based partnerships can deliver real change in delivering nature recovery, as set out in Natural England\u2019s strategic direction 2025-2030. Opportunities for blended finance continue to be explored. This includes maximising the use of public funding opportunities such as Landscape Recovery, Protected Site Strategies and species focused seed corn funding. Where possible, delivery will be also be strengthened by grants, such as the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Critical to project development is growing private sector funding that supports nature recovery and environmental security.
