            "text": "pEPR represents a major shift in the way that the costs of waste are handled. It works in lockstep with two other significant reforms which we are introducing: Simpler Recycling collections for bins in England, and a Deposit Return Scheme for drinks containers."
        },
        {
            "text": "The scheme works by charging fees to the businesses that use packaging to meet the costs of collecting and recycling it. From year two of the scheme, it will introduce modulation where the costs are higher for hard-to-recycle materials. Where packaging can be reused or refilled, fees are lower."
        },
        {
            "text": "This will encourage businesses to reduce the amount of packaging they use, shift to more recyclable materials and design new products that can be recycled and reused more easily, stopping waste from going to the nation\u2019s landfills or incinerators."

            "text": "Steel, aluminium and PET plastic drinks containers across the UK are\u00a0not charged under pEPR, as they will be covered under the UK\u2019s\u00a0Deposit Return Scheme."

        },
        {
            "text": "It is right for businesses who produce packaging to pay their fair share of the recycling costs, rather than the burden falling solely on councils. As materials which are easier to recycle, refill or reuse are liable for lower fees, businesses will be rewarded for shifting to those materials and designing greener products \u2013 helping us clean up Britain and end the throwaway society ."

The\u00a0final base fees\u00a0were published in June 2025 and represented a significant reduction in costs for every single material except fibre composite, which saw a small increase. Some of the biggest high-street businesses are already introducing innovative packaging and exploring refill and reuse schemes."
