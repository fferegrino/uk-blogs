We did not consider that this amount would prohibit or impede the Claimants from bringing their claim."

No new intensive badger control licences in the High Risk and Edge areas of England have been issued since August 2022. The licensing of both intensive and supplementary badger control is on a steep downward trajectory, with the final round of licence authorisations and badger control taking place in 2025. All remaining licences of this type will then expire in January 2026. "
