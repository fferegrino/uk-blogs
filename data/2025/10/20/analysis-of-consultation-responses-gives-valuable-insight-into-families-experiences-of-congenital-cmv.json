It can be more serious if it is passed on to a baby before they are born when it is known as congenital CMV (cCMV). This can happen if a woman catches CMV, or if she had CMV before and it becomes active again when she is pregnant."

It is worth noting, however, that most children born with cCMV do not develop long-term symptoms, so their families\u2019 experiences are less likely to appear in public consultations. This provides important context for our findings."

            "text": "Families identified several missed opportunities along the often-lengthy journey from first noticing symptoms to getting a diagnosis. This caused them uncertainty, anxiety and distress. Families believed that not screening for CMV caused diagnostic delays, which they felt led to missed chances for treatments that might improve their child\u2019s outcomes (for example, antiviral treatment or early therapies)."

Our approach of analysing anonymous consultation responses is fairly new, and we hope other researchers might use this approach in future. These analyses could increase the amount and quality of scientific papers that inform future UK NSC evidence reviews and related policy development, such as clinical training."

This helped us suggest improvements to how responses are collected in future to make them more useful for research. For example, collecting basic background information (where respondents agree) would provide context and allow more detailed analysis."
