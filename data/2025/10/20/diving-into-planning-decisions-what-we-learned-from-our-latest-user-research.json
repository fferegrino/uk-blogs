To unlock the full potential of this information and make critical details about what\u2019s been approved and where more accessible, we\u2019ve started work to standardise decision notices. This will help local authorities access the information they need instantly, supporting more effective planning and reporting for housing and infrastructure, while making this data available to others for analysis and forecasting. We\u2019re driving forward these important improvements as part of our mission to standardise planning data across England."
