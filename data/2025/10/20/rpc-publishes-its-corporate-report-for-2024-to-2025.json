            "text": "The report reflects on a very busy year with many changes for the RPC, including the completion of the transition to the revised Better Regulation Framework (BRF). This new framework has moved the RPC's scrutiny role to earlier in the policy-making process and focused our work on reviewing the rationale and choice of options to support better policy making."

            "text": "Of the 77 submissions we received this year, 43 were impact assessments submitted under the previous BRF, 27 were under the new BRF, and the remaining seven were post-implementation reviews (PIRs)."
        },
        {
            "text": "We are particularly pleased to report substantial progress in addressing the longstanding issue of departments failing to complete PIRs. Following our publication of a list of outstanding PIRs across government and direct engagement with permanent secretaries in departments with the most outstanding PIRs, we have seen a positive response with significant progress being made. While there is still some way to go, this represents an important step in improving attention to evaluation. "

We are keen to help government in developing this target and offering our expertise in independently verifying the cost reductions achieved."

Members Daniel Dalton, Stephen Gifford, John Longworth and Andrew Williams-Fry left the committee this year and we wish them the best in their future endeavours."
