My journey began in local and oral history, working with young people to document the stories of elders in their communities. Moving into classroom teaching felt like a natural progression, and I\u2019m truly grateful I made the step. I find the work deeply fulfilling, intellectually stimulating and meaningful. "

In my previous role, I had more flexibility during the week to regularly engage in hobbies and creative interests. Transitioning into teaching meant adjusting to a new rhythm, one that was rewarding but more structured."

I was excited by the idea, but also unsure whether it would be viable for me or the school. Fortunately, my school was supportive of my request, and I moved to a four-day week."

By working four days a week, I now have the time to pursue music seriously - whether practising solo, rehearsing with my band or travelling to gigs. I have since performed locally and further afield. These opportunities were made possible by working flexibly. \u00a0\u00a0"
