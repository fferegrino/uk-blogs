The dust particles scatter sunlight and as they are left in space, and swept back by the solar wind from our star, they form beautiful, seemingly glowing, tails. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened with Comet Lemmon in recent weeks and now its tail and a glowing cloud of gas, known as the \u2018coma\u2019, around the main body of the comet have become bright enough to be visible in a good pair of binoculars.\u00a0"

It\u2019s aiming for launch in mid-2028 to mid-2029 and, once in space, will sit waiting for a suitable cometary target to visit and study in detail. UK researchers are involved in the Comet Interceptor mission science, including the selection of the spacecraft\u2019s destination. One of the science instruments onboard, which will examine the composition of the comet, is also being developed and led by the University of Oxford while another, a magnetometer, is being led by Imperial College London.\u00a0"
