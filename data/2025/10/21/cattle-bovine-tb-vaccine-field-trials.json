As part of the UK Government\u2019s long-term strategy to eradicate the disease, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has been leading a pioneering initiative to develop and test a cattle vaccine and its companion diagnostic tool, the DIVA skin test. These tools represent a significant step forward in the fight against bTB, offering the potential to protect cattle while accurately identifying infected animals."

These trials are essential for gathering the scientific evidence needed to support future deployment of the vaccine and skin test across the UK. With Phases 1 and 2 now complete, the project is entering its third phase, expanding the scope and scale of testing to further validate safety, performance, and practical delivery."

This was a crucial first step to ensure the test could accurately identify animals that were truly infected, without producing false positives."

This phase involved over 600 cattle from seven herds in five farms from the low-risk area in England and provided valuable data on how the vaccine and test perform in real-world conditions."
