We\u2019ve seen this momentum building in my own Digital Sustainability team in Defra \u2013 for example in the expansion of our Government Digital Sustainability Alliance (GDSA) advisory group, and in the increasing collaboration we\u2019re leading across government on this issue with things like the Government Buying Standards (GBS)."
