This non-native plant can quickly spread and block waterways, starving the water of oxygen. In response, our staff cleared substantial amounts of the invasive vegetation from the river. This work was supported by Anglian Water who temporarily reduced abstraction, increasing river flow."

Fish were carefully moved to enclosed lakes with better water levels. These lakes were not used for fishing so provided a safe home where fish could recover."
