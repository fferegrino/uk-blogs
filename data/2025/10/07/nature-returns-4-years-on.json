For example, trees can take carbon out of the atmosphere and support biodiversity at the same time, and wetlands can store flood waters, build resilience to climate change and provide habitats for threatened species.As we look towards a Land Use Framework for England, we need to manage land for multiple benefits if we are to have any chance of meeting all the demands placed upon a small island by a growing population."
