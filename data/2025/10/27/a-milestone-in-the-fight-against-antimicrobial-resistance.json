            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is not just a scientific buzzword; it is a global crisis. When bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites outsmart antimicrobials (for example antibiotics), infections become harder or impossible to treat, diseases spread faster, and lives hang in the balance."
        },
        {
            "text": "Its impact is far-reaching: AMR threatens human health, animal welfare, food security and the environment. By 2050, the World Bank predicts it could reduce the GDP of low-income countries by more than five percent and push millions into poverty."
        },
        {
            "text": "One of the most important tools for monitoring AMR is antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). This involves isolating bacteria and exposing them to different antibiotics to determine which are effective. Reliable AST results are essential because they guide treatment, track resistance trends and help assess infection prevention measures, such as improved farm biosecurity. Standardised AST methods also enable laboratories worldwide to compare data, providing a clearer picture of how resistance spreads."

Supporting the UK\u2019s 2024 to 2029 National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR, which emphasises global partnerships, the Centre has been actively engaged in the implementation of the Philippines\u2019 own 2024\u20132028 NAP. This includes strengthening laboratory capacity, improving surveillance systems and generating reliable AST data."

            "text": "The Philippines launched its first-ever national training workshop on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in July 2025 in Quezon City, Metro Manila. Lead by the Department of Agriculture \u2013 National Meat Inspection Service (DA-NMIS) and co-organised with the UK\u2019s FAO Reference Centre for AMR and was supported by Scientific Biotech Specialties Inc. (SBSI), Thermo Fisher Scientific and the Department of Agriculture \u2013 Bureau of Animal Industry (DA-BAI). The workshop drew on the scientific knowledge of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Cefas, and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) to equip participants with the tools to tackle AMR head-on and brought together cutting-edge expertise and international collaboration with partners"

A total of 32 participants representing 28 institutions (including national and regional government bodies, academia, Food and Agriculture Organization\u00a0(FAO), and private sector leaders) came together in a powerful show of unity. With backgrounds spanning terrestrial and aquatic animal health, environmental science, and public health, the cohort embodied a truly multidisciplinary force. The event also underscored a critical message: when government and industry join forces, the potential to elevate laboratory capacity and fight AMR multiplies."

            "text": "Across three days of lectures and practical sessions, participants strengthened technical skills and built lasting connections across animal, aquatic and food sectors. The workshop marked a turning point in harmonising laboratory methods nationwide and generating the high-quality data needed to guide treatment decisions, protect food systems and safeguard public health. The workshop demonstrated the progress possible through shared expertise and commitment."

Maluping and Dr. Thomas Chisnall with Cefas counterparts Dr. Athina Papadopoulou and Dr. Andy Powell led the training and served as resource speakers, supported by colleagues from NMIS, BAI, SBSI and Thermo Fisher. The programme combined theory with hands-on practice, equipping participants with both the knowledge and confidence to conduct AST in their own laboratories."

Participants explored both manual and automated testing methods and learned how to interpret results using clinical breakpoints and epidemiological cut-off values. This theoretical foundation showed how AST data strengthens national surveillance and supports the responsible use of antibiotics."

            "text": "The hands-on sessions made the topics much easier to understand. Each participant carried out AST using a commercially available Sensititre system.
