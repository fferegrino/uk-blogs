Whether it\u2019s through home adaptations, equipment and technology provision, moving and handling skills, reablement, or creative thinking to promote the independence of people with long term conditions, we bring wellbeing to life.\u00a0\u00a0"

By enabling people to live independently, return to work and avoid crisis care, occupational therapy reduces long-term costs and supports financial sustainability. From preventing hospital admissions, future proofing housing stock, improving practice quality, reducing reliance on statutory services and improving system efficiency through early intervention and prevention, the profession plays a vital role in system design and delivery.\u00a0"
