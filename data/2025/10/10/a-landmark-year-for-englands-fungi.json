For example, they help keep the soil healthy by breaking down dead plants and animals, and they also help plants take in water and nutrients by working closely with their roots (mycorrhizal associations). This improves carbon sequestration, which is where carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. Wild fungi are also important food sources for many people around the world.\u00a0"

Now more than 1,300 species are on the list \u2014including 77 from the UK, of which half live in natural grasslands that that haven\u2019t been disturbed by farming or development."
