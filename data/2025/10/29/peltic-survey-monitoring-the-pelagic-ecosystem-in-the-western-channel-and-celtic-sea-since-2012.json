            "text": "These fish species feed on plankton (microscopic algae and animals) and in turn are the main food source for seabirds, sea mammals, including dolphins and whales, and large fish, from cod and hake to bluefin tuna. Several of these small pelagic species, such as (Cornish) sardines and sprat, are also targeted by commercial fisheries, providing an important food source for people and supporting local livelihoods."

            "text": "To ensure their stocks are managed sustainably it is essential to monitor their population size as it can fluctuate strongly from year to year. Changes in abundance can also be driven by environmental conditions such as water temperature. Therefore, it is also important to monitor the pelagic ecosystem where small pelagic fish live."

The survey supports the UK\u2019s commitments to sustainable fisheries management and tackling issues of food security and biodiversity loss."

            "text": "Each survey, carried out on board the Research Vessel Cefas Endeavour, covers more than 3500 km of transects in the waters to the south-west of the UK. Small pelagic fish are mapped and quantified using fisheries acoustic methods (echosounders). A pelagic trawl is used to sample the fish, to confirm the species composition and to collect biological information (fish size, weight and age). The combined acoustic and trawl information is converted into a biomass (weight) estimate for that survey year."

Thanks to the PELTIC survey data, these stocks are no longer data-limited, allowing monitoring to assess the sustainability of these fisheries."

Other components of the ecosystem are also monitored providing information on phytoplankton (microscopic algae), and zooplankton (microscopic animals) which are key food for fish larvae, as well as the environmental conditions. In fact, sea surface temperature may also affect small pelagic fish dynamics and their reproduction."

            "text": "To study the role of top predators in the study area, the survey has been collaborating with MARINElife since 2013 and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), in recent years. A unique multi-year dataset of observations on cetaceans and seabirds, including Europe's only critically endangered seabird, the Balearic shearwater, has been collected. These observer data were also important in capturing the return of Atlantic bluefin tuna in British waters, since their population disappeared in the 1960s."

By being at sea, observing the changes in the different components of the ecosystem, we can start developing hypotheses about the processes that may be driving the small pelagic fish ecology\u201d."

As a result, PELTIC survey data, accessible through the Cefas Data Portal has been at the core of multiple scientific publications (see Google Scholar), contributing to advancing our understanding of the marine ecosystem of the waters south-west of the UK."
