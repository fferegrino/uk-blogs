His first year was spent with the Department for Business and Trade, where he worked on the Swiss Free Trade Agreement. In his second year, at HM Treasury, he tackled diverse challenges including Ukraine-related projects, Mayoral engagement, and work on the Heathrow expansion.

After an initial unsuccessful application, she joined the Department for Work and Pensions as a Work Coach in Lincolnshire. This experience gave her the confidence and skills needed to successfully re-apply to the Fast Stream. Based in Nottingham throughout her programme, Abi worked across multiple departments on nationally significant projects such as net zero policy for social housing. Abi now works as a Grade 7 in MHCLG's Resilience and Response Directorate."
