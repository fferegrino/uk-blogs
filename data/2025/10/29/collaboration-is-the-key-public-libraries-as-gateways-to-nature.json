            "text": "In an era where connection - to nature, community, and wellbeing - is more important than ever, Culture Nature England (CNE) is helping to open up new opportunities for people to engage with the natural world. As part of Natural England\u2019s Protected Site Strategy research and development programme, CNE reimagines public libraries as gateways to nature, creativity, health, and community resilience. At its heart, the programme aims to inspire more people to care about and connect with nature - especially those who may not typically engage with it. Delivered in partnership with Libraries Connected, CNE is bringing this vision to life through practical, community-led projects that strengthen both people and places."

            "text": "Protected Site Strategies are all about working with a wide range of stakeholders to collectively tackle environmental pressures that impact protected sites and their surrounding communities, landscapes or seascapes. These pressures could be nutrient pollution, climate change, or various other complex issues that cannot easily be tackled without collaborative action."

            "text": "This is why Natural England partnered with Libraries Connected on CNE; CNE is a celebration of cross-disciplinary collaboration. It brings together librarians, conservationists, artists, educators, health professionals, and community groups to co-create experiences that deepen people\u2019s connection to the natural world. With 25 library services across England receiving funding to deliver hundreds of activities, the programme has reached thousands of individuals\u2014many of whom face barriers to accessing nature or cultural programming."

            "text": "From sensory walks and archaeological surveys to courtyard gardens and immersive digital experiences, CNE activities reflect the richness of its partnerships. Libraries have worked with organisations such as\u00a0 Wildlife Trusts, National Parks, Volunteer groups, schools, care homes, ESOL groups, and health and creative practitioners- representing wide cultural interests and offering the most diverse and inclusive of entry points. These collaborations have not only expanded the reach of nature-based programming but have also reshaped perceptions of what libraries can offer, and how collaboration brings sustainable and sustained approaches that can ease many of today\u2019s societal challenges."

The result was a powerful reminder that nature and culture are deeply intertwined\u2014and that libraries can be custodians of both."

            "text": "Somerset Libraries took a different approach. Using digital tools, VR headsets, soundscapes, and filmed visits to protected sites, libraries demystified nature for those with limited mobility or access. These events not only increased library membership but also strengthened relationships with schools and environmental partners."

Resulting in an area wide initiative that will work across South Tees, Redcar & Cleveland and Middlesbrough Library Services delivering a new programme: \u201cNaturally Active Libraries\u201d, working with communities across the area and building a sustainable \u201ctemplate\u201d that can then be rolled out further afield."

The Culture Nature England programme has not only expanded what libraries do, but also who they do it with. It has shown that with the right partnerships, even modest resources can create profound impact."
