The courage to step into the unknown, to test the limits of what\u2019s possible, and to bring back knowledge that advances the understanding of the collective. Regulation isn\u2019t usually seen as exciting or adventurous, yet in many ways it demands the same spirit."

Through technical testing, evidence generation grounded in real-world use cases, workshops, regulatory deep dives, and collaboration, we identify approaches that could be used to address key regulatory challenges often experienced with AI as a medical device (AIaMD)."

Together, we explored how new datasets for testing AI could be generated responsibly, how large language models (LLMs) could be made safer for healthcare by improving transparency and explainability, and by reducing the likelihood of errors. We also examined how products could be continuously monitored once on the market."

            "text": "AI is only as good as the data used in its development. We worked with Philips Healthcare to explore a novel solution to instances where data is scarce: using an LLM to create realistic but artificial \u201csynthetic\u201d radiology reports for testing. We then compared this synthetic data to real reports using automation and human experts. Philips also looked at using AI to act as a \u201cjudge\u201d to assess the quality of the reports. The results were promising \u2013 synthetic reports were successfully created, but the LLM judge had some limitations. This highlighted the importance of regulatory guidance on quality of synthetic data and its validation. A lack of clarity may lead to flawed or incomplete synthetic data and validation techniques which could risk patient safety in real-world use."

            "text": "AI \u201challucinations\u201d, when systems generate confident but incorrect responses, is another key challenge. In most healthcare contexts, the risks of incorrect information could be detrimental. The AutoMedica SmartGuideline project found that grounding AI models in verified clinical sources using a proprietary version of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) helped reduce these errors compared to using a general-purpose model alone. RAG is an approach that can be used to ground an AI model\u2019s responses in information retrieved from trusted external sources, improving accuracy and transparency."

            "text": "It\u2019s important that patients, clinicians and others in the care pathway understand the outputs from the AI medical device that they are using. For example, knowing why an AI medical device has recommended a specific treatment empowers users to accept or reject the recommendation. This \u201cexplainability\u201d was a primary focus for the OncoFlow project. Using various tools, the OncoFlow system demonstrated how the AI reached its treatment recommendation decisions. Clinicians surveyed noted this as being \"extremely important\" for building trust and ensuring transparent, safe use of AI in clinical practice. Guidance on AI explainability may help innovators when devising relevant approaches which can help build trust and address these human factors."

            "text": "The final questions were about how to monitor an AIaMD after it has been deployed in a hospital. Our work with Newton\u2019s Tree demonstrated that continuous real-time monitoring of AI medical devices is important. We saw how such monitoring could detect concerning patterns, such as clinicians becoming over-reliant on AI systems due to factors like fatigue and time pressure. Developing guidance around continuous monitoring for ongoing AI safety surveillance would help to identify and address potential risks, like change in AI performance or user over-reliance, before they impact patient safety."
