He also taught me the importance of reading carefully, especially before signing anything. My mother often said, \u201cThere\u2019s good and bad in everyone,\u201d reminding me to treat people with respect and to reject the labels others may assign to me."

A challenging experience when I joined the Civil Service led me to become involved with the race network, called RESPECT, where I later served as an area chair. I also joined PROUD and other networks as a member or ally when I moved to the Ministry of Justice."

            "text": "Standing firm means doing the right thing, even when it is difficult. While we all carry unconscious biases, we must still recognise and challenge unfairness. I have faced bullying for standing up for myself, but I stood firm, and support others facing similar challenges."

            "text": "Many of the opportunities we have today are built on the resilience of those who came before us and overcame immense obstacles. To waste what they fought for would dishonour their legacy. Our community has made significant contributions to humanity and technological progress often without recognition. We must continue to share knowledge and support future generations."

As a founding member of Digital & Technology\u2019s (as we were then called) first Diversity & Inclusion Group, the Digital & Technology Normalising Group, that won the Civil Service Employee Network Excellence Award 2018 and were one of the finalists for the Civil Service Diversity & Inclusion. Winning the Employee Network Award sparked several initiatives, including a collaboration with UK Black Tech and continues to shape other initiatives, e.g. the Coding Black Females collaboration event which aims to increase the representation of Black women in technical role. In 2020, following the horrific murder of George Floyd, I organised the first listening event within Justice Digital and, alongside PROUD, developed the first allyship training template used across Justice Digital."

So, this time, we ask - What do you (our senior leaders) believe needs to be done to increase Black representation in senior roles within Justice Digital? and What are your hopes for continual inclusion?"
