The branding became one of the biggest talking points during the pitch, demonstrating just how crucial visual identity can be for product success.\u00a0"

A quick search on our trade mark search confirms that Notorious Nooch have wisely registered their logo under trade mark UK00003546764. Without trade mark protection, competitors could potentially use similar logos, causing confusion in the marketplace and potentially damaging your brand's reputation. Registration gives you exclusive rights to use your logo and enables you to take legal action against anyone who uses it without permission.\u00a0\u00a0"

If it\u2019s new and has individual character, you can apply for design registration, starting from \u00a350.\u00a0\u00a0"
