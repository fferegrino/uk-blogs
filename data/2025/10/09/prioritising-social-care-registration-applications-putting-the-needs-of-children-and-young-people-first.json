These circumstances can include the need for a home that can care for children with complex support needs. The revised policy complements April\u2019s changes to the Social Care Common Inspection Framework to promote greater stability for children who might otherwise experience multiple moves and disruption in their lives.\u00a0"

The total number of children\u2019s home applications in the last 12 months was almost double the figure for the previous year.\u202fWe are also still receiving a significant number of supported accommodation applications each month, adding to the already unexpectedly high volumes.

We will closely monitor the effectiveness of this approach for children\u2019s homes in the coming months. If it has the desired impact, we will consider implementing a similar policy for supported accommodation applications in April 2026. In the meantime, I urge all potential providers to base their applications on a clear understanding of local need and their ability to meet that need.\u00a0"
