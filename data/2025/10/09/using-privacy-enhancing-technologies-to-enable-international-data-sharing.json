            "text": "Over the last year the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) has piloted the use of novel Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to enable NHS England\u2019s National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) and the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to study ultra-rare childhood tumours, securely, lawfully and at speed: protecting patient privacy and keeping NHS data under NHS control. The pilot builds on experience from the 2022-23 UK-US Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) prize challenges. This blog explains why the pilot matters, how it works, and what it tells us about the future of digital innovation in government, and the commitments in the Blueprint for Modern Digital Government."

            "text": "Data on cancer is gathered by disease registries at national or subnational scale. Every childhood cancer subtype is rare; some affect fewer than two children per million each year. Pooling data over a larger geography helps researchers to better understand these diseases and improve patient outcomes by enabling more robust analyses and providing clinicians and patients with accurate statistics for prognoses. The need to protect patient privacy to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain public trust can make large-scale export of patient-level data slow, costly and, in some cases, impossible. A better technical approach is needed."

For example, NDRS were able to work through a process that typically takes over a year for international collaborations in roughly two months. Reducing the lead time for data release also meant we had more time to focus on meaningful research. This process involved several robust cycles of information governance and cybersecurity checks and tests, coupled with several analytical assurance procedures. We found the ICO guidance on PETs incredibly helpful in guiding this process."
