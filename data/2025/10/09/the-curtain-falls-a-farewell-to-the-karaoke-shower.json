Yes, that is right, the shower curtain is finally coming down on what must rank as one of the most bizarre education initiatives, not just at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), but in government history.\u00a0"

The concept was simple (and borrowed from the Cracking Ideas Exhibition the IPO had funded a few years earlier). Get people singing popular songs, capture their performance on camera, share them on social media, and in the process, teach them about respect for copyright.\u00a0It was Dragons\u2019 Den meets Britain\u2019s Got Talent, but with more intellectual property (IP) and significantly less talent."

Lines of young people formed to take their turn and the huge queues were a captive audience for our messaging on respect for copyright.\u00a0\u00a0 "

At its peak it was in demand for every youth experience and became part of The Big Music Project and World Skills.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t just young people who wanted a go \u2013 prominent MPs, Queen\u2019s Brian May, JLS\u2019 Oritse Williams and even Father Christmas himself all took a turn in the Karaoke Shower.\u00a0"

But the message remains the same. Creativity has value and that value deserves protection and respect.\u00a0"
