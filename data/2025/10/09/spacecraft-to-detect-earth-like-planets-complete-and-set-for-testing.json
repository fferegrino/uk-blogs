UK researchers and engineers have contributed across science and technology: Professor Don Pollacco of the University of Warwick leads the mission\u2019s Science Management team, UCL\u2019s Mullard Space Science Laboratory designed and built the camera electronics, and Teledyne e2v produced the CCD detectors. In addition, the University of Cambridge is heading a national consortium to develop the UK Plato Data Centre, supported by the University of Birmingham, University of Oxford, St Andrews and the Open University. Thales Alenia Space UK worked with prime contractor OHB on avionics development and service module integration. Together, these contributions position the UK to play a central role in Plato\u2019s discoveries.\u00a0"

These measurements will reveal the presence of exoplanets as they pass in front of their stars. To achieve this level of sensitivity, each camera must remain at around -80\u00b0C. Protected by the sunshield and facing deep space, the instruments will naturally cool and remain at this temperature throughout the mission.\u00a0"

In September, engineers successfully tested this deployment on Earth by simulating weightlessness with a system of pulleys. They also confirmed that the panels can generate the required electricity by shining simulated sunlight on them."
