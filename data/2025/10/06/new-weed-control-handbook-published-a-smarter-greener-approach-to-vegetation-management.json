This new edition reflects more than two decades of evolving practice, policy, and environmental awareness. It offers practical, evidence-based guidance for anyone managing vegetation on sites of ecological importance.\u00a0"

It is a valuable resource for landowners, contractors, and managers working in semi-natural habitats such as woodlands, hedgerows, riverbanks, field margins, and amenity areas. These landscapes often fall outside of agricultural schemes but still require thoughtful weed control to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function.\u00a0"

Many Natural England and DEFRA colleagues contributed to its development, and their expertise has helped shape a resource that will support our work across the country."
