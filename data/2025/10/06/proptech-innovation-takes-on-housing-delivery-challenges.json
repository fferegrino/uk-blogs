Now, following a series of in-depth judging days, 84 applications have been whittled down to 12 selected pilots which were launched at a celebration event at the end of September. These teams will now develop their innovations further, including real world testing with local authority and developer partners.\u00a0"

The energy in the room was tangible, and it was clear the teams were eager to move from their pitch presentations to the implementation phase.\u00a0\u00a0"

Five teams are exploring how they can offer greater certainty to developers with tools that provide reliable insights into essential infrastructure capacity. Meanwhile 6 companies are focused on unlocking small site delivery by reducing investment risks and improving viability assessments for smaller developments. You can\u202ffind out more about the statements in another one of our previous blog posts and Geovation's Challenge research report."

I am delighted that these teams are embarking on their journeys of discovery alongside local government partners who are equally passionate about solving these problems. These partnerships represent something new \u2013 a shared commitment to solving complex problems together, through innovation, with the ultimate goal of delivering the 1.5 million homes our country needs.\u00a0"

This way, we can maximise the number of people who benefit from these innovations. I have also asked them to consider how we can enable local authorities to leapfrog their current practice and what key messages I need to take back to policymakers to help make this happen. I am looking forward to seeing how they respond.\u00a0"
