Through my lived and professional experiences, I advocate for children living in kinship care and their families across England. Twelve months into this position, I've met children, parents, carers, extended family members, and professionals across the sector. Each conversation has deepened my understanding of kinship care's complexities and highlighted its vital role in giving children the best start in life."
