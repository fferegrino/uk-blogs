I\u2019ve spoken to many families whose homes have flooded. For one family after months of waiting for their home to be repaired, whenever it rains, their children are afraid, not wanting to go to school, worried they\u2019re going to flood again. Flood impacts continue long after that rain has stopped, and the waters recede.\u00a0 \u00a0"
