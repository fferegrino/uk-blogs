This includes Long Baseline Multistatic Radar, which will test a global radar network to track distant objects in geostationary orbit; SLOSH-Cat, which will study how spacecraft fuel moves in microgravity to make satellites more stable and precise; and ARGUS, which will develop autonomous rendezvous technology, paving the way for satellites to safely inspect and service each other in orbit. In addition, AquaWatch-AUK, led by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), will continue to receive support to advance its integrated water quality monitoring and forecasting system."
