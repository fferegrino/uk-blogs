Primarily, I manage the Ministry of Defence Gibraltar airfield, ensuring it's ready for military and commercial use and regulatory oversight findings from the Military Aviation Authority and Civil Aviation Authority are addressed. I do this while maintaining executive oversight of RAF Gibraltar functions, including air operations, logistics and engineering. Another key element is to ensure RAF Gibraltar staff, and their families enjoy serving overseas by aligning regular teambuilding, sport and welfare opportunities."

The Military Air Transport Fleet deliver rapid mission critical support to Gibraltar, enabling Royal Gibraltar Regiment troop movement and Royal Naval vessel engineering and resupply, alternative shipping timelines would introduce significant delay. In addition, the Military Air Transport Fleet significantly benefit from routine overseas sorties to Gibraltar, allowing aircrew to maintain air mobility capabilities in optimal condition and a mission-ready status."
