Hence, we built a data platform using PostgreSQL for storage and Airflow for data pipeline orchestration, both open source technologies. These run using\u00a0AWS services which simplifies maintainability, scalability and reliability while giving us the flexibility to migrate to another cloud provider if needed. Although native Postgres isn\u2019t typically used for analytics, our initial data volumes were modest enough to justify its use. Advances in server performance over recent years have enabled us to handle increasingly large datasets.\u00a0\u00a0"

By building our data platform from the ground up and prioritising open source solutions, we\u2019ve gained greater flexibility and control- tailoring the platform to our users needs. This approach may be less common, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the trade offs. We're committed to open sourcing our platform in the future, so others can build on what we\u2019ve learned and developed.\u00a0\u00a0"
