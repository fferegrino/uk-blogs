Known more widely as \u2018mad cow disease\u2019, BSE is a neurodegenerative disease in cattle that first emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in the 1980s. It not only reshaped farming practices but also had profound implications for public health, food safety, and international trade."

This marks the culmination of nearly four decades of scientific vigilance, regulatory rigour, and collaborative effort, much of it led by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)."

The UK responded with sweeping legislative changes, including a ban on feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) to ruminants, later extended to all farm animals. These measures were essential to halting the spread, but the road to recovery was long."
