From this season, you\u2019ll also be able to track your symptoms on your profile each week.

FluSurvey is one of the key methods we use to understand how these viruses are spreading in our communities. This is valuable information for us because not everyone who feels unwell will call 111, visit their GP, or go to hospital, so their symptoms may not be captured. Community-based systems like FluSurvey include data from those who manage their symptoms at home, giving us an early understanding of respiratory illness activity across the whole population."

            "text": "When added to our existing sources of information, the value of real-time data on respiratory illnesses, provided directly by households countrywide, is immense. It's like having thousands of health detectives scattered across the country, all working together to build a comprehensive picture of flu-like illnesses. By taking part in FluSurvey, you would be contributing a vital piece to a larger puzzle. The data you submit will also form part of our award-winning UKHSA data dashboard, which shares public health data in a simple, inclusive and accessible way."
