As outlined in our recent blog posts on strategic ambitions for data and open-source infrastructure for data platforms, our department is committed to building a future-ready data ecosystem. At the heart of this transformation lies a critical foundation: data governance and security."

They ensure that data is used responsibly, ethically, and effectively across departments, while safeguarding public trust and complying with legal obligations. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in public sector decisions and operations, the importance of robust governance and security frameworks has never been greater."

Without strong governance, data misuse can lead to biased algorithms, privacy violations, and erosion of public confidence. Conversely, well-governed data enables responsible AI deployment, ensuring fairness, transparency, and compliance with legal standards."

Many departments are transitioning from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC,which assigns permissions based on predefined roles) to more flexible Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) systems. ABAC considers multiple contextual aspects, such as user location, project affiliation, and time of access, allowing for more nuanced and dynamic permissions."

            "text": "Protecting sensitive data, especially health, financial, and personal information, is a top priority. Organisations employ a range of techniques to safeguard this data, including cleansing, masking, and complication. These methods help ensure that sensitive records are not inadvertently exposed or used inappropriately."

            "text": "For example, one participant organisation described a rigorous process of removing sensitive records from datasets before they are made available for broader use. Another highlighted the heightened legal sensitivity surrounding health data, which requires stricter controls and compliance measures."

            "text": "Organisations are increasingly conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments(DPIAs). They are appointing data owners and data stewards (as recommended by the Government Digital Service in their guidance on Data Ownership in Government (HTML) - GOV.UK), and integrating governance into data architecture and workflows. During the discovery project, one organisation shared plans to embed data stewards within every operational \u201cspoke\u201d of their operations, ensuring that governance is locally owned and contextually informed."

            "text": "Balancing openness with security is a recurring theme. Government departments and other public or private organisations want to enable innovation and collaboration. However, they must also protect against risks such as data breaches and unauthorised access. This \u201cbalancing act\u201d between enabling access to vital data assets and securing them effectively becomes a major challenge in the times of AI and cyber threats."
