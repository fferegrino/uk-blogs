The enormous\u00a0loss of life during the American Civil War sparked unprecedented interest in communicating with the deceased. Many families had no bodies to bury, making spiritualism's promise of contact particularly powerful. By 1897, spiritualism had more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe. Communicating with the dead\u00a0wasn\u2019t\u00a0considered bizarre, and\u00a0the\u00a0users were primarily\u00a0middle and upper class\u00a0citizens seeking comfort and answers - the stage was set for a commercial breakthrough.\u00a0"

He further expanded his\u00a0IP\u00a0portfolio by registering\u00a0the\u00a0United States (US)\u00a0trade mark\u00a0for the word \"Oracle\" in 1902 (US\u00a0Number: 37806).\u00a0"
