As a patent examiner, there was one entrepreneur in particular that stood out to me - Rajan Bhojwani - pitching his business, SeeTheTape\u00ae.\u00a0\u00a0"

Rajan\u2019s invention is trying to solve a problem we\u2019ve all experienced; the frustration that is finding the end on a normal roll of sticky tape. It was his experience as an eye surgeon that inspired him to come up with a solution to this problem.\u00a0"

            "text": "As part of Rajan\u2019s medical work, he examines the cornea of the eye (the clear part in front of the pupil) to detect fine lines in it. Because the cornea has the dark pupil as a background, the lines are easier to see and so Rajan transferred this idea to the tape.\u00a0"

            "text": "He realised that if clear tape is wound on to a reel with a black or dark background, it would become much easier to see the end of the tape. He experimented with this idea and found that it worked. A simple idea, but after conducting some research he realised that such a tape roll\u00a0 had not been invented for this purpose before. Rajan then began the patent application process.\u00a0"

However, Rajan was able to show the documentation from the UK Intellectual Property Office proving that he was going to receive a granted patent and was also able to produce the claims- the set of statements that define the invention and its scope. Sara Davies looked at these and was impressed with how claim 1 (the main claim setting out the scope and main inventive concept) was a strong and clear claim to an invention.\u00a0\u00a0"

However, Rajan clearly felt that his business, which had just started trading, had a good chance of success and wanted to develop it himself. He also had some samples of the tape to show the Dragons, and all of them were able to see (pun intended) how well it worked.\u00a0"

There are many tape manufacturers and tape has been made for a very long time. However, no one before had come up with Rajan\u2019s particular solution to the hidden tape-end problem, showing that ideas don\u2019t have to be complex to be innovative.\u00a0\u00a0"
