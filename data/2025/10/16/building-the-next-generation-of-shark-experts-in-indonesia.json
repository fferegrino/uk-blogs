            "text": "Sharks have roamed our oceans for over 400 million years, but today many species are facing the threat of extinction. Overfishing, habitat loss, and the global trade in shark products\u2014from fins to meat\u2014are putting immense pressure on their populations. Indonesia, as the world\u2019s largest shark-fishing nation and major exporter of shark products, plays a pivotal role in whether sharks can survive and thrive in the decades to come."

            "text": "Yet conserving sharks is not simple. Shark fisheries in Indonesia are deeply intertwined with the livelihoods of coastal communities; sharks are caught both on purpose (target fisheries) and accidentally (non-target fisheries) and end up in complex domestic and international trade networks. On top of that, international regulations like CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) require accurate species identification and trade monitoring to curb illegal and unsustainable practices. But it\u2019s difficult to tell look-alike species apart and identify partially processed products. To succeed, scientists in Indonesia need to be equipped not only with strong scientific skills but also with an understanding of communities, governance, and trade."

The programme is a collaboration between our project partners (Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, REKAM, Cefas and BRIN), IPB University (Indonesia) and Liverpool John Moores University (UK). Together we will focus on four critical areas:"

Project leaders Effin Muttaqin (REKAM) and Dr. Joanna Murray (Cefas) shared the goals of the wider IWTCF project, while the students presented their research plans and progress. Over the week, they delved into shark stock assessment methods, fisheries data systems, and governance frameworks\u2014essential tools for tackling shark conservation challenges in Indonesia. Feedback from the UK supervisors proved invaluable, sparking new ideas and refining approaches."

They trained in gender and social inclusion (GESI), learning how to ensure that marine conservation benefits all members of society, and took part in a scientific paper writing workshop led by Cefas scientist Dr. Georg Engelhard, aimed at sharpening their skills for publishing research and developing their theses."

Here, they met policy advisors working on international marine issues, from Regional Fisheries Management Organizations to CITES regulations. The students presented their own projects and learned how scientific research can directly feed into policymaking\u2014a vital link in ensuring sharks are protected not just in theory, but in practice."

Starting with a night-time tour of the Newlyn Fish Market as it geared up for the next morning\u2019s auction, scientists demonstrated how they sample and measure fish\u2014including with a high-tech electronic measuring board\u2014and explained why this data is essential for sustainable fisheries in the UK. A particular highlight was spotting freshly landed bluefin tuna in the market \u2013 not something you see everyday!"

The conversations were lively, with plenty of comparisons between UK and Indonesian fisheries. The UK team was astonished to learn that Indonesia has a fleet of around 800,000 fishing vessels and hundreds of landing sites\u2014a scale almost unimaginable in British waters."
