This will qualify them to prescribe medicines within their ASC setting and provide nurses with credits towards the advanced practice Masters."

I am delighted that we received a fantastic response from ICBs to take part in the Pilot. The calibre of applications was outstanding, and I am very much looking forward to working closely with the six ICB Chief Nurses to help make this pilot a success."

This strategy is designed to provide students with placements in social care to enhance their knowledge and clinical skills in a supportive environment. By embedding learning in practice we're helping to shape a nursing workforce that is better informed, highly skilled and truly person-centred.  At the same time, we are encouraging students and professionals alike to see social care as a rewarding area of specialist practice. "
