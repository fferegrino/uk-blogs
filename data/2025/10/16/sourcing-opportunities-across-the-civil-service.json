            "text": "The Civil Service employs over 500,000 people across a range of different departments and locations. This means that sharing messages and developing relationships with different recruitment teams and business areas is an ongoing focus, and the GFIE team spend time raising awareness of the talent and potential that candidates from our pathways bring.\u00a0"

We do this by working closely with the recruiting department to find out who they are looking for - what skills do they need? Is experience necessary or will training be provided? What strengths do candidates need to have to thrive in a role?"

The vacancies were also promoted at a Silverstone Veterans engagement event, where one of our Engagement Leads shared details of the opportunity face-to-face with attendees, answering questions and encouraging applications."

            "text": "As HMRC continues to recruit through GFiE pathways, the number of colleagues who join through these routes increases and in turn their contribution to outreach activities have a positive impact. If someone doesn't believe that the Civil Service is for them, perhaps because of their background or perceived worries about what it'll be like, hearing from a peer who has followed that path already can be the deciding factor in whether or not to submit an application."
