At the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), this day is more than symbolic, it is a celebration of the science and dedication that goes into keeping our food supply safe. From the lab bench to the farm gate, our teams work tirelessly to protect public health by tackling threats like Salmonella."

            "text": "Salmonella has been with us for millennia, evolving alongside humans and animals since the Neolithic shift from foraging to farming. Today, we can identify over 2,700 types based on their surface structures, and that number keeps growing."
        },
        {
            "text": "All Salmonella types have the potential to infect both animals and people. Transmission can occur through direct contact, contaminated materials and, most commonly, food."
        },
        {
            "text": "Most of us have heard of Salmonella, or even experienced it first-hand. In healthy individuals, infection is usually confined to the gastrointestinal tract and resolves on its own. But for vulnerable groups, such as young children, the elderly, or those with weakened immune systems, Salmonella can pose a much greater risk."
        },
        {
            "text": "In these cases, the bacterium can move beyond the gut, entering the bloodstream and lymphatic system, leading to an infection through the entire body. Symptoms may include high fever, joint pain, and severe fatigue, and treatment might require antibiotics to prevent further complications."

        {
            "text": "Salmonella does not just affect people, it is a shared challenge between animals, humans, and the environment. Animals can become infected in several ways: they may acquire it from their parents before birth, pick it up through contact with other infected animals (or even people), or encounter it in contaminated surroundings."

        {
            "text": "When an animal is infected, its products, like meat and eggs, can become contaminated. This can happen at the farm or later along the food chain. That is why abattoir hygiene is critical: it is a frontline defence in preventing contamination before food reaches our plates."
        },
        {
            "text": "But the responsibility does not end there. Safe food handling at home is just as important. Avoiding cross-contamination and cooking food thoroughly are simple yet powerful steps we can all take to protect ourselves and our families."

            "text": "We keep abreast of the latest technology, for example using whole genome sequencing (a way of obtaining the full genetic code of each Salmonella isolate). By analysing the full genome, we gain deep insights into the epidemiology of infection, understanding how it spreads, mutates, and clusters. This level of detail empowers us to pinpoint where outbreaks are most likely to occur, so we can respond swiftly and effectively."
