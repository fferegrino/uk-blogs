Last year at COP16, Defra published its vision and criteria for delivering 30by30 on land in England.\u00a0Defra will soon publish its 30by30 action plan, setting out how we can build momentum and bring farmers, National Parks and National Landscapes, eNGOs and others together to deliver on this important target. We will also share more about the role of businesses and green finance, including our partnerships with organisations like 30x30 UK. Achieving this ambitious target will require urgent and significant action to drive nature\u2019s recovery, and all sectors have a role to play.\u00a0\u00a0"
