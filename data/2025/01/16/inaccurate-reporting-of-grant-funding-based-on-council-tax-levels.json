This would require either a local referendum or the council to be granted exceptional financial support from the government. It would not result in increased grant funding. Ministers have been clear protecting taxpayers will be central to considering any requests for additional rises from councils that require exceptional financial support. In line with the previous government\u2019s approach, we will consider requests \u2013 but this government will be putting working people at the forefront of our decisions and only agreeing in exceptional circumstances."
