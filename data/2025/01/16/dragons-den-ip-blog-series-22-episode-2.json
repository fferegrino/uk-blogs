            "text": "From mystery football shirts on your doorstep to Italian pizza in pubs, the second episode of series 22 was full to the brim with keen entrepreneurs ready to pitch their business to the Dragons. The panel of business moguls were, as always, full of questions to keep them on their toes. In this episode, I tuned into all things Intellectual Property (IP) whilst taking notes of a few businesses that would certainly be useful in my own life!\u00a0"

After a quick search on our \u2018Search for a trade mark\u2019 tool, I was delighted to see that they have wisely registered a trade mark for their logo. \u00a0"

Having worked in busy hospitality settings myself, I can see the need for easy and tasty food options to please customers. I certainly hope they\u2019ll continue to roll their products out to more retail venues so I can give it my very own taste test.\u00a0"

            "text": "As the Dragons continued to devour the pizza, it had me wondering what makes their pizza so special. According to the website, one of the things that sets them apart from their competitors is their sourdough base. If their recipe is unique, the boys may consider protecting it with a trade secret. For this to apply, the recipe would need to be well protected and must derive value from its secrecy. If the duo choose to do this, they should ensure that anyone involved - suppliers, manufacturers, employees - sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to prevent them from disclosing the recipe. To learn more, check out our NDA guidance page which includes example NDAs.\u00a0"

Putting her money where her mouth is, she was the first Dragon to make an offer for the full \u00a390,000 in exchange for 10% of the business. Sara Davies also jumped in, but as Peter Jones played on the fact that they all lived in the same town, his offer stood out and the Doughboys walked away from the Den with the longest standing Dragon on their side.\u00a0\u00a0"

The Dragons loved the concept of his subscription model, that sees mystery football jerseys from across the globe delivered to the doorsteps of subscribers. While they were charmed by Alex\u2019s passion and personality, they were disappointed when he couldn\u2019t deliver the figures they were asking for. In the end, it was Sara Davies who decided to take a punt on the entrepreneur despite, in her own words, the \u201cdog\u2019s dinner\u201d Alex made of his figures. She offered him all the money in exchange for a 15% stake of the business, with the addition that she would drop her stake to 10% once she had earned back her money.\u00a0\u00a0"

There\u2019s no place for counterfeit kits in football and for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the IPO ran an educational campaign to raise awareness of the harm counterfeits pose to the football community, consumers and the wider UK economy.
