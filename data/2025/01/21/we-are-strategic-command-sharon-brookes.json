I\u2019m also the Strategic Command Social Mobility Champion. I\u2019ve been in the Civil Service for 32 years now, with 26 of those spent in defence, predominantly at Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) in Abbey Wood"

My strength is leadership and bringing a different way of thinking. Not being a technical specialist actually enables me to ask fresh questions and encourage new approaches - I can empower my subject matter experts to apply their deep knowledge while challenging assumptions and helping them see challenges from different angles. About four years ago, I got the chance to join the Defence Academy and contribute to the defence education system\u2014it was an opportunity I was really excited to take on."
