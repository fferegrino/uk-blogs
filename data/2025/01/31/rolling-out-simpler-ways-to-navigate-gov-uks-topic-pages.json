            "text": "The design layout of the page is a really important part of helping to navigate to the right information. Have you ever noticed that some websites display information in a grid format, while others use a list? As a general rule, lists are better for text-based content, like the information you\u2019ll find on GOV.UK. Lists are easier to scan and our eyes naturally follow a list format, making it more intuitive to navigate. To test this theory we ran an A/B test where half of our users were shown a grid design of the page, and the other half saw a list design. This allowed us to compare how people responded to the 2 layouts."
