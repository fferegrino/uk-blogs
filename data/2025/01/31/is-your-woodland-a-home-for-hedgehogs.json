They require just a diet of ground-dwelling invertebrates, especially earthworms, and somewhere warm to nest and hibernate. They really do ask for very little."

That\u2019s no good for a creature that uses these linear features for transport and both winter and summer nests. In summer, the thornier and \u2018nettleier\u2019 the better (yes, I know that\u2019s not a word, but you know what I mean). In winter, the denser the bramble patch the better."
