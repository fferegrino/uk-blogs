I have long been enamoured with kelp and the species which rely on it \u2013 as proven by pictures of myself as a child playing with cast-off strands of seaweed on the shore. \u202f\u00a0"

            "text": "Kelp, a group of large seaweeds, forms dense forests under the sea. They create some of the most productive habitats on the planet and can be found not far from the shoreline. Kelp forests themselves can act as a buffer against storms, increase oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide and absorb anthropogenic nutrients. What I have always loved about kelp is that they are ecosystem engineers - they create habitat through their structure. This means they provide shelter, nursery grounds, and feeding grounds to a wide array of species, as the kelp forest holds numerous food sources. This includes species such as sea snails, sea urchins and limpets. Despite their resilience however, they are at risk from disappearing from our seas \u2013 in the Northeast Atlantic, both their reduced distribution and decreased genetic diversity have been reported."

The team set out with a clear aim, to capture the beauty as well as the function of this important habitat, highlighting the many species that rely on it.\u00a0\u2018Forests Beneath the Waves\u2019 was born."

In the film we see an undulate ray and two-spot gobies hiding from predators, a nursehound shark looking to lay her egg in a safe place, and a seal hunting for food. A whole world in an underwater forest that would usually be unknown to us land-dwelling creatures. Raising awareness of the importance of kelp is necessary to safeguard its future."

            "text": "In past decades, a strong decline of kelp across the world has been observed, including in the UK. Climate change is a big factor. I have myself witnessed the increase of bleached kelp during heat waves, and escalating storms destroying entire parts of kelp forests. The warming waters induce a change of ecosystem too. Species of kelp are starting to migrate north, and non-native species of both seaweeds and animals are arriving in the UK. In the film, the eerily graceful and luminous crystal jellyfish is captured, a species common in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean, but a visitor to our seas.\u00a0"

            "text": "Other factors contributing to the decline of kelp forests include increased nutrients, through run-offs from agriculture and other human activities, bottom trawling practices in fisheries, ecosystem imbalance favouring kelp grazers, and pollution of inorganic metals.\u00a0"

            "text": "I specifically chose a career focusing on the sea to inject hope into the world. While we cannot stop all those factors of decline, together we can work to reduce those pressures on kelp forests, helping them become more resilient to what this changing planet is throwing at them."
