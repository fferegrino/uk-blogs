For example, we continue to struggle with recruiting and retaining the right skills and expertise in our digital teams.

People shouldn't have to work out which benefits it\u2019s worth them applying for; or remember the steps they're supposed to follow when they want to start a new business. We should take a responsible, ambitious stance on using AI to help deliver public services: understanding its potential, and using it where it makes sense to do so.\u00a0"
