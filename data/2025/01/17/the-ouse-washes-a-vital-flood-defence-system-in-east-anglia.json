            "text": "The Ouse Washes Flood Defence System is a large\u00a0flood storage reservoir in Cambridgeshire. It is approximately 30km (19 miles) long and up to 0.8km (0.5 miles) wide, capable of storing up to 90,000,000m3\u00a0of water. The reservoir is maintained by the Environment Agency and partners including private landowners, and the Hundred Foot Washes Internal Drainage Board."

            "text": "While the Ouse Washes is a vital flood defence system, its importance extends far beyond flood management. The Ouse Washes is one of the largest remaining areas of lowland wet grassland in the UK and holds notable environmental value as a Site of Special\u00a0Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Protection Area (SPA), and a Ramsar site."

            "text": "From April to October, the team closely monitors the water levels and quality in the Delph (Old Bedford River). As flood water drains off the washes, it can bring with it low-oxygen, poor quality water - without intervention, this can lead to fish distress and, in some cases, fish mortality."

        {
            "text": "Remote telemetry units known as SONDEs are used by the team to monitor water quality like dissolved oxygen levels in real time. These devices send alerts to the team when levels begin to drop, allowing them to make a swift response. The team also regularly visit the site to ensure the equipment is in working condition."

        {
            "text": "Aerators are deployed by the team to blow air into the water column through a Venturi system, which helps to oxygenate the water. The field team are responsible for monitoring the aerators everyday to make sure they are fuelled and working properly."
        },
        {
            "text": "In addition to aeration, sweetening flows are used to improve water quality and prevent stagnation. A sweetening flow is when fresh water is introduced into the Delph by opening sluices. This process replenishes oxygen levels, and by keeping the water moving it reduces oxygen depletion. In emergency situations Fisheries staff may also undertake emergency oxygenation using chemical aeration techniques, principally with hydrogen peroxide, to rapidly improve water quality."
