            "text": "Hi, I\u2019m Gerry Hackett, and I\u2019ve taken up this new role because I believe the group can really help government to manage their technology estates better. In its simplest form, circularity is about reusing stuff where you can, and recycling when you can\u2019t, coupled with an understanding of the cash and carbon impacts of those decisions."

            "text": "What exactly does good look like in this context? What are the key considerations? Within the CEWG are many, many years of experience in answering these questions on behalf of some of the largest organisations in the world. I think we can distil that knowledge for the benefit of government, to better understand the issues, save money and improve environmental performance."

        },
        {
            "text": "I began my time in the technology circular economy back in 1992, when I founded Nationwide Computer Auctions. The concept was a regular calendar of auctions where anyone could buy and/or sell used tech hardware and software. The auctions were instantly popular and quickly expanded the events to three sales every weekend across fifteen sites in Southern England."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over the next five years we began to attract businesses, large and small, looking to realise value from their used IT estates at auction. To address this demand, we quickly gathered the key elements of the IT Asset Disposal proposition \u2013 transport to collect the equipment, data wiping tools to erase data, electrical safety testing, mass industrial recycling by product type and regulatory compliance across the whole operation. The Environment Agency was our first customer and RDC was born."
        },
        {
            "text": "RDC was the business bought by Computacenter (CC) in 1999. RDC has operated circular services for Computacenter from that date until now. With a brief interlude, following the Arrow acquisition, I have been in charge of the business throughout this time."
        },
        {
            "text": "I oversaw the development of its service portfolio for Computacenter\u2019s large corporate and government customers. With our colleagues at CC, we have gradually merged the sourcing, maintenance, financing and deployment of new technology with the reuse and recycling of used."
        },
        {
            "text": "In January 2025, the business was renamed Computacenter Circular Services, and I stepped back from the day-to-day management of the business to look at our broader strategy in the UK and internationally. The opportunity to chair this working group within GDSA has therefore come at a good time. I\u2019m both grateful and excited at the prospect of making a difference beyond the walls of Computacenter."

        {
            "text": "We have representatives from most of the technology sector and we should bring that experience to bear, to clear some of the fog surrounding this business of circularity. When I set up NCA in 1992, the circular economy was simply the used economy, giving discarded product a new life in someone else\u2019s hands. It is an ancient activity with direct relevance to today - saving money, time and energy by mending, fixing, repairing, upgrading and reusing used stuff."
        },
        {
            "text": "This has always made sense, but it has a greater urgency today with the ubiquity of digital technology, the scarcity of raw materials and the need to retrieve those materials when the reuse routes are exhausted."
        },
        {
            "text": "Then we have energy. B2B technology represents about one eighth of worldwide electronic waste and it is consuming more and more of the world\u2019s energy output. The measurement and evaluation of our carbon footprints is a key element in the decisions around the deployment of technology assets."
        },
        {
            "text": "I think our priority, therefore, is firstly to provide government with a guide to the main features of the digital circular economy. We can explain terminology, outline good process, look at key yardsticks, and highlight the tangible benefits, both in carbon and cash, of the right approach. We have the right people in the working group to bring this alive across central and local government and suppliers."
