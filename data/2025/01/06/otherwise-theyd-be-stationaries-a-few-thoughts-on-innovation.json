It had a sense of being used solely as a safety-net for a risk averse culture. It was that use of the word 'fail'. But it\u2019s also only partially quoted. The full quote is: \u2019fail early, fail often, but always fail forward\u2019 which gives a better sense that it is the progress that is important. But it\u2019s still that pesky 'fail'.\u00a0"
