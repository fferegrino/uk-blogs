Indeed, \u2018Embracing adaptation, innovation and working strategically with partners in seeking solutions that tackle the causes of pressures, rather than the symptoms\u2019 is one of our key marine Nature Recovery Principles."

            "text": "The \u2018Disco Scallop\u2019 technique is heralded as a breakthrough in providing a commercially viable alternative method to catching scallops that does significantly less damage to our seabed. This started out as a scientific experiment led by Fishtek Marine and operated by the Cornish fisherman Jon Ashworth. Together they uncovered the potential for illuminated crab pots to attract scallops. After two years of fine-tuning the gear and technique, with support from a combination of partners including Natural England, this experimental fishery has led to the inception of a fully commercial fishery currently operated by more than 40 vessels across the UK."

            "text": "The produce, Disco Scallops, is a high quality, low-impact product that can command a premium price for the fisher with the target market being high-end restaurants. In parallel to the development of the fishery Fishtek Marine has helped facilitate the establishment of a marketing co-operative to help fishers get a fair price for their premium product. This will be essential otherwise there will be limited incentive for existing fishers to fish with this particular gear."

            "text": "It is early days, but Natural England welcomes this transition, be it for potters to augment their crab and lobster catches with scallop or for existing scallopers (dive caught or dredgers) to try their hand at this. The Marine Management Organisation is watching how the fishery unfolds to see if special regulations need to be put in place. As it will be an additional pressure on the existing scallop stock it is imperative that the new King Scallop Fisheries Management Plan incorporates this mode of fishing into its long-term vision for more sustainable scallop fisheries. Natural England looks forward to further partnership working with Fishtek in all aspects of sustainable fishing."
