Before joining, I worked in hospitality for ten years and then at Warner Brothers Harry Potter studio tour, which I enjoyed as a massive Harry Potter fan. However, this job truly feels like it has a purpose, which I haven\u2019t experienced before. I studied criminology and sociology, so I\u2019ve always had an interest in this type of work, and I had a mentor at university who encouraged me to do the interview.\u00a0"

My dad is a genealogist and has traced our family history back to Ghana, teaching me a lot about my heritage. I know a lot about Black history and culture, and our PDU is very diverse, so I wanted to celebrate our cultures. I had support from the Head of the PDU, and we started planning.\u00a0"

But in all seriousness, I\u2019m honoured to have been involved because it\u2019s something that\u2019s quite close to me. While my mum has highlighted it, I hadn\u2019t really been taught or celebrated Black history before, and it was nice to see others interested in it. It was a real moment for me when we finished the gallery and took a step back to look at what we had created.\u00a0"

We\u2019ve had some practitioners who have been in the Service for twenty years, and it was great to hear their journey into probation, what has stuck with them, and what sort of legacy they would like to leave behind. We also had our lunch event, and people went all out and made so much food. People sat, ate, and talked, and it was great to see it bringing everyone together. I\u2019ll never forget that day and everything we\u2019ve done this month. Being able to have the space to celebrate Black history has been so special.\u00a0"
