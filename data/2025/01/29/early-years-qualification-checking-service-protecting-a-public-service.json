            "text": "During the development phase, which may span several months, it's crucial to prevent search engines from indexing and restrict public access. This is especially important if it involves complex government policies that need to be correct and complete before going live."

Otherwise, they are redirected back to the guard page. This setup allows different passwords for different environments and includes an 'on-off' switch to disable the guard page in production."

            "text": "When we sent invitations to Early Years managers who volunteered to take part in the service\u2019s pilot phase, we included the service address and a password, with a request not to share it. This approach has been successful and easy to manage. When the pilot ended, we simply changed the password to revoke access."
