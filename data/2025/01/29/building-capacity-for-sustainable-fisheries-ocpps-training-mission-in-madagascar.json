The OCPP delivers work under three thematic areas: biodiversity, marine pollution, and sustainable seafood. Funding is provided through the Official Development Assistance (ODA) overarching Blue Planet Fund (BPF) by the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and delivered collaboratively by the\u00a0Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas),\u00a0Marine Management Organisation (MMO)\u00a0and\u00a0Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)."

The two-day course in \u2018Tana\u2019 was targeted at the analysts employed by the Centre de Surveillance des P\u00eaches (CSP; Fisheries Surveillance Centre), with an introduction provided to the digital tools that can be utilised to detect the presence of fishing vessels within Malagasy waters. This included demonstrations which highlighted the benefits of using satellite data to identify high risk vessels, over the expensive and time-consuming alternative of deploying a patrol vessel, as well as an overview of the range of data sources that enable remote investigations to be carried out into a fishing vessel\u2019s legitimacy and activities, without the need to board or inspect it. Such techniques enable the more than 1.1million square kilometres of Madagascar\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to be more effectively managed."

A combination of vessel monitoring sources were used to identify a suitable target for inspection, which was fishing in an area around a three-hour steam from the port. The transit time was put to good use, with the MMO and CSP teams discussing and exchanging fishing gear measuring methods and trialling the use of equipment to determine the most suitable techniques for the environment."
