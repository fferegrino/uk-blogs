We want both domestic and international businesses to see the UK as a great place to invest. This means giving start-ups and venture backers the confidence to launch their businesses here in the UK, not elsewhere in the world. It means encouraging multinationals \u2013 with a pretty much free choice to place their investments anywhere in the EMEA time zone \u2013 to choose the UK.\u00a0And it means giving our domestic businesses the encouragement and confidence to get on and invest.\u00a0\u00a0"

But we want to hear what works for you \u2013 what\u2019s going to give you the confidence to invest. The CMA's Growth and Investment Council, which met for the first time this week, does just that. The Council was launched at the start of this year and brings together the leaders of 12 major UK business and investor groups."
