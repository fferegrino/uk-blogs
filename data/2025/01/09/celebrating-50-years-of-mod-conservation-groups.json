            "text": "The importance of the MOD estate for supporting wildlife and heritage has long been recognised. In 1971-73, the Nugent Committee examined the necessity and management of Defence land holdings. It noted the importance of the estate, and highlighted the need to actively manage its abundant wildlife and heritage features, alongside the increasing demands for public access."

            "text": "In response to the Nugent report\u2019s recommendations, numerous MOD Conservation Groups were quickly formed to liaise with external organisations, develop land management plans, and implement practical conservation measures. The first of these was created at Longmoor, Hampshire in 1974 by the MOD\u2019s first ever Conservation Officer, Lt Col (Ret\u2019d) Christopher Norman Clayden."

            "text": "In 1974, the future of Woolmer Forest as a site of biological interest looked less than rosy. The effects of acid rain had seriously reduced the pH of Woolmer pond, and the cessation of turf cutting and grazing livestock in the early 20th century led to the encroachment of pine, birch, willow, bracken and scrub."

(Ret\u2019d) W J Briggs informed readers that \u201cthe clearance of conifers from Queen's Bank on Woolmer Forest (where Queen Anne was said to have 'reviewed' her Red Deer hinds in the early 1700s) will allow the regeneration of dry heathland.\u201d"

Dr Denton\u2019s article explains how, despite the railway itself being long gone, its legacy for wildlife remains of great importance for some of the UK\u2019s rarest reptile, amphibian, and bird species."

The project was overseen by the DIO Ecology team, working with stakeholders including ARC, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and Natural England. The cattle play an important role in providing conservation grazing, helping to maintain quality habitat for natterjack toads as well as aiding mire restoration."

The data is actively used to inform site management plans in order to meet ecological requirements, all in careful balance with supporting military training. \u00a0"
