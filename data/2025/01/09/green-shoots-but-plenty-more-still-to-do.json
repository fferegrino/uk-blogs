Of course, there are still acknowledged limitations in this data \u2013 in particular, because, like almost every organisation, in every sector, calculating supply chain \u201cScope 3\u201d emissions (generated from across our supply chain), as discussed here,\u00a0 is extremely challenging to do, accurately."
