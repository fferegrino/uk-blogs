Episode one certainly capitalised on this and started off strong with the introduction of a new guest Dragon. Who better to step in for this first episode than fitness influencer Joe Wicks. I have followed Joe since lockdown - when PE with Joe was the way we started every morning - trying to homeschool my children and make sure they moved their bodies every day while we had to stay at home. \u00a0"

            "text": "While Joe Wicks joined the Dragons, it was Joseph Keegan who was the first new entrepreneur of 2025 to face them. His interest in health and fitness is definitely not a new year\u2019s fad. Such is his passion in fitness, he has turned it into a business idea, looking for \u00a370k for a 10% stake in his business BodyXCore. I knew the synergy with the two Joe\u2019s in the Den wasn\u2019t just going to be down to the shared name. Joseph\u2019s story of passion and his struggles to get his business idea up and running immediately resonated with Joe Wicks and all the Dragons. \u00a0But was his pitch also going to fulfil my requirements? I was hoping he would have thought about his intellectual property as well as his fitness and well-being and I was certainly not disappointed."

            "text": "Joseph talked to the Dragons about the money he had spent on his business, including the expense of securing his patent. Like Joseph, we would always recommend securing the help of an IP attorney when applying for a patent as the process can be complex. Engaging the help of a professional will lead to much more success with your application. The Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys (CIPA) is a great place to start to find a patent attorney near you."

A quick search of the designs database allowed me to view the different designs that Joseph has protected."

            "text": "Designs are a great way to add further layers to the protection of your product and to deter people further from trying to copy you. They protect the look, decoration, pattern or shape of a product. They are a relatively affordable form of IP protection with one design costing from \u00a350."

Joe Wicks has a number of registered trade marks to protect his Body Coach fitness brand. It is the reputation and loyalty which this brand has built which will help Joseph and the BodyXcore."
