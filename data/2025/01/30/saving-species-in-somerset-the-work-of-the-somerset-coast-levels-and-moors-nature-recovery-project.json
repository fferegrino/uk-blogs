The landscape is special, its low-lying wetland nature, with peat soils and salt marsh, means it has retained many species which have been lost from the wider countryside."

Much of this work has focused on species, whether that be habitat restoration, population monitoring or distribution research. Three projects stand out for me. \u00a0"

            "text": "The first was delivered by the Hawk and Owl Trust on their Shapwick Moor Nature Reserve, which is part of the Somerset Wetlands National Nature Reserve. They created four new \u2018scrapes\u2019 on the site to diversify the range of wetland features. Due to the expertise of their survey volunteers, they discovered that these scrapes had been rapidly colonised by great crested newts and lesser silver diving beetles. These are two rare and threatened species which had never been recorded on the reserve before. This demonstrates that relatively small scale and simple actions can result in exciting and rapid responses by species."

            "text": "The second project was with the RSPB, this time focusing on breeding wading birds. Rare species, such as curlew, lapwing, snipe and redshank breed in the wet grassland habitats. However, due to their ground nesting habits, they are vulnerable to pressures such as hay cutting and predation. For many years the RSPB has been working with landowners to locate and protect the nests of these precious birds. This is difficult and time-consuming work. This is where the Nature Recovery Project comes into its own. Funding has enabled the RSPB to test whether drones fixed with thermal cameras can help locate and thereby protect their nests. This innovative research found that this method works and has led to more nests being protected. \u00a0"

            "text": "The third project switches from land to water and delves into the weird and wonderful world of the European eel. This remarkable creature breeds in the Sargasso Sea and migrates 4,000 miles to Europe, where it lives its adult life before returning again. Many end up in the rivers, streams and ditches of the Somerset coast, levels and moors landscape where it is valued part of its natural and cultural heritage. Our knowledge of this species is limited, so we funded the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust to carry out a distribution survey. Using eDNA techniques, they were able to show that eels are found across the majority of the landscape but in some areas man-made barriers (such as pumping stations) could be interfering with their migration. We are now working with partners to further improve our knowledge of eels and help improve their survival."

Restoring healthy natural ecosystems is essential to support human life - the water we drink, the food we eat and the air we breathe. We know that helping nature to recover is a powerful tool with multiple benefits for improving people's health, generating wealth and building the country's resilience to climate change and for food security."

We are working with our partners to develop new plans for some of the other threatened wetland species found in this unique landscape. We know what needs to be done to save species in this beautiful landscape, we just need the resources to do it."
