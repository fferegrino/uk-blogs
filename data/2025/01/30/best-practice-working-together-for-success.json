Our recent engagements with Stroud District Council and Forest of Dean District Council demonstrate the benefits of this approach."

Marine planning is often overlooked within estuary environments, which do not immediately identify with the term 'marine'. However, concerns raised by residents about the lack of marine plan considerations prompted us to clarify their relevance."

In response, our marine planning team issued a comment emphasising that activities such as improvements, drainage, or sewage discharges are likely to affect the surrounding marine environment and therefore fall under marine planning regulations."

        {
            "text": "We worked closely with the council to review the document and clarify key policies. Initially, some marine plan policies appeared to lack equivalent local plan policy. However, upon further inspection, we found they were more aligned than initially thought. After consulting marine planning policy leads, we confirmed alignment and refined the wording to ensure consistency. In cases where minor differences remained, we collaboratively resolved them, ensuring the final document reflected a shared understanding and served as a best-practice example of an SoCG."
