            "text": "One of the unique challenges of exporting is the broad range of rules and regulations that goods must adhere to, depending on where they\u2019re being sent. For us, this means needing to cater for thousands of different EHCs, including \u201cSheepskin to China\u201d and \u201cDairy to Australia\u201d, each requiring a different set of information. Furthermore, these certificates are updated regularly, as importing country requirements change."

            "text": "As a result, when designing EHC Online, we knew configurability would be key to delivering the volume of digital journeys required, and to enable us to respond rapidly to change. So, rather than developing each journey through bespoke code, we developed a form-builder, which empowered Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) staff to configure, iterate and publish digital journeys themselves."

            "text": "EHC Online was designed in a user-centred way, and our user researchers continually validated our assumptions with real users to inform development. This input highlighted that it wouldn\u2019t be enough to design the form-builder well \u2013 the content configured by form administrators would need to be user-centred too."

        {
            "text": "We started by embedding a content designer and interaction designer into the form-building team, to produce initial form designs ready to test. We carried out usability testing on a selection of configured forms, to understand how users would interact with the content, and then used these to iterate our designs."
        },
        {
            "text": "But we knew the approaches we took for the first few forms would need to consistently scale-up to cater for the thousands of forms that would be configured. So, we created a set of design principles to guide those configuring the forms on how to frame page titles consistently, and how to order content and pages. We put together a content library \u2013 a spreadsheet of usability-tested content \u2013 which promoted reuse and enabled consistency across content."
        },
        {
            "text": "Lastly, we knew user research would be key to ensuring we were meeting users\u2019 needs, but it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to do multiple rounds of usability testing on each of the 1,500-plus journeys. So, we adopted a risk-based approach by segmenting user groups, the types of goods they work with and the countries they were exporting to. We invested more research time into higher volume journeys, non-standard journeys or where a new segment hadn\u2019t been encountered before. Over time we were able to gradually scale down the level of user research, to a point where it would only be required by exception \u2013 when a new pattern, concept or user group was encountered for the first time."

        {
            "text": "Prior to adopting agile practices, the team\u2019s process was a tangle of spreadsheets and post-its which resulted in slow production, cumbersomely manual quality checks and journeys which weren\u2019t coherent in their language, layout or flow."

            "text": "The team then adopted an agile approach to form configuration, based on Kanban. The team visualised their work on a Kanban board, which had the added benefit of highlighting any bottlenecks or blockers. Our design principles ensured each form the team designed had the same flow, with content written in a consistent voice.\u00a0 If any design issues arose, the team had a set of guiding principles to fall back on which really aided problem solving."

            "text": "For example, in the initial process, form administrators would prototype their ideas in Microsoft PowerPoint before configuring them on the system. But over time, they identified this step took longer than simply configuring the form on the system and making any required adjustments there. So, they adjusted their process accordingly, which increased throughput and reduced the average turnaround time."

            "text": "Borrowing from software development processes, the team built peer review and acceptance testing steps into the process to ensure any issues were captured before the forms were made live to users. Over time, as common problems were encountered, the team amended their quality assurance checklists, and the number of issues identified reduced."
        },
        {
            "text": "These checklists enabled all issues to be captured in the initial stages, and no content or design issues would be uncovered in the second stage of \u201cacceptance testing\u201d. This offered another opportunity to simplify and streamline the process, so the quality assurance steps of the process were brought together into a single step, further increasing throughput."

            "text": "The team built feedback loops into their process to ensure they had visibility on any issues with the forms they published. Over time, they were able to build up evidence to demonstrate the quality of their outputs. They used this evidence to agree a delegated authority for the team to publish new form journeys themselves without requiring external approval, which removed 1to 3 days from the average turnaround time."

        },
        {
            "text": "Without an ability to publish a form for testing, the form administration team would need to configure their forms on a non-production environment for testing. The scope for manual error in replicating this configuration on 2 environments would impact quality and in turn slow down throughput. So, EHC Online\u2019s development team extended the form-building capability to provide this feature, in turn reducing form administration effort and speeding up throughput."
