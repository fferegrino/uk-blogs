It was interesting to see what I had kept over the years from the days when policy documents came in bound hard copy - it is easy to think that some things don\u2019t change! Amongst other papers, I found a CQC special study on hospital discharge from 2004, the 2008 End of Life Care strategy (another hot topic as the Assisted Dying Bill progresses) and from 2009, a vision to reform our care and support system to establish a National Care Service.\u00a0 Perhaps it is not that things don\u2019t change, rather that knotty challenges take thoughtful, long-term and consistent work to achieve change."

We must build on this with shorter term reforms to address the ongoing challenges facing Social Workers and social care leaders. I am keen we work together to use the evidence from practice wisdom, the expertise of people with lived experience, data and research to enable people to live good lives."

My journey as a social worker started working with children and families and veered towards adults when, early in my career, I worked with people with HIV/AIDs, who at the time were facing huge stigma, discrimination and usually end of life.\u00a0 I have over 30 years\u2019 experience of working in local authorities in different roles, both operational and commissioning.\u00a0 My first DASS role was in Camden, and I served as the President of ADASS. I am returning to DHSC, having worked previously as a civil servant responsible for policy on mental health, learning disabilities, autism and dementia.\u00a0"

Working with key leaders in the profession, experts by experience and wider colleagues, together, we will drive forward important improvement and reform to support people to live the lives they choose."
