This arose after the 2020 lockdowns, where limitations renewed our appreciation for being able to go outside and experience nature, and the physical and mental health benefits it brings."

We hear and have seen a family of foxes playing near the ponds edge and can see the vast badger setts \u2013 with a visitor in our garden earlier this year. There is also a healthy population of tawny owls that shout to each other (very loudly in the middle of the night)."

There\u2019s an area in the woods called the 'cup and saucer' (nobody seems to know why) and is made of some interesting bumps and lumps which have been used by many young people over many years as an area to have some fun in. The Common is also well used by the neighbouring nursery and scout hut."

They are spaces to enjoy and teach us the value from having close contact with nature. So when creating new woodlands and forests, let\u2019s not forget these small treasures that often get overlooked."
