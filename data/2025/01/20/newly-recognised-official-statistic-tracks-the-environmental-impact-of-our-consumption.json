Our consumption of these items creates a demand for their production. This, in turn, can drive deforestation, put pressure on scarce water supplies,\u00a0and lead to excess use of fertilisers and pesticides."

This growing interest is reflected in internationally-agreed consumption targets in both the Global Biodiversity Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals. To meet these international objectives and develop effective policies to ensure consumption is sustainable, governments need to understand these environmental impacts, where they are happening, and what is causing them."

This year\u2019s update went out just before Christmas, providing users with an extra year of data in the time series. Alongside this, a new biodiversity metric, the \u2018LIFE Metric\u2019 was added. This is a more complex measure of biodiversity impact than was previously available on the dashboard. It maps where species are likely to go extinct as a result of land-use change."

Component indicators are a list of optional indicators that, together with the mandatory headline indicators, cover the goals and targets of the GBF. Due to the complexity of measuring the impacts of commodity consumption, Target 16 does not have a headline indicator, placing added importance on its component and complementary indicators."

For instance, by highlighting impact hotspots, both in terms of commodity type and producing country, consumption policies can be directed to where they will be most effective."
