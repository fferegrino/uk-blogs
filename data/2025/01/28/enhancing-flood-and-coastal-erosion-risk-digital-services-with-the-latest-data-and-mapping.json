Both use the best available data, information and modelling from the Environment Agency and local authorities to provide the most detailed and accurate understanding yet of current and future risks."

It\u2019s crucial that people check what the long-term flood risk is for their area and know what to do in the event of a flood. If homes or businesses are at risk of flooding, for the first time on the digital service, it is possible to see information on potential flood depths as well as future flood risk taking into account climate change."

We will add new information to this service to display surface water risk and to show how climate change may affect the extent of future flood risk from rivers and the sea. The improved service will assist planners and developers to make decisions about the location and design of new development and will make it easier to produce flood risk assessments.\u00a0\u00a0"
