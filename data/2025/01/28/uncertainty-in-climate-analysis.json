As the effects of climate change become more obvious, there is a growing urgency for public sector bodies to assess climate-related risks and understand how they might evolve in the future, so that they can manage these as effectively as possible. This is reflected in recent requirements for public sector bodies to produce climate-related financial disclosures in line with Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations."
