We discussed how we had begun this journey into digital sustainability; defining a digital service and the challenge of calculating our emissions. It took us nearly four months to develop a baseline and since then, things have moved very quickly."

If you reached out, thank you. If it spurred you on to address the emissions in your digital services \u2014 amazing! Keep going! (And please do share your experience.)"

That means we\u2019ve now reached the level of global warming at which Earth systems are at risk of entering a dangerous zone. This will trigger critical changes with cascading consequences for economies and societies including intensifying wildfires, droughts, floods, invasive species, vector-borne diseases, crop failure, economic hardship and more. It makes for intensely sombre reading. It emphasises how important the work we\u2019re doing is right now and how important it is to keep going."

We also needed to consider increasing digital emissions against the emissions produced by alternative user journeys like driving to a Post Office. Our goal is to make digital as sustainable as it can be and this involves making sustainable solutions scalable so the emissions savings accumulate."

They demonstrate the wealth of opportunities available to reduce our emissions and make One Login more efficient and more sustainable. But if we want to really make One Login a truly sustainable digital service we need to embed sustainability principles and practises throughout the whole team.\u00a0 Focusing on building digital resiliency would have a greater and longer lasting impact than just efforts to decarbonise. Ultimately, we want digital sustainability to be as important a consideration in building and developing digital services in government as accessibility is."

Low Power Mode reduces energy use by reducing the amount of power a device uses by among many others; shutting off apps activity not being used and reducing the brightness of the display  which is incredibly power consuming. Low Power Mode also helps to preserve a device's battery health by regulating its temperature and preventing it from becoming too hot, and thus can help extend the lifespan of a device."
