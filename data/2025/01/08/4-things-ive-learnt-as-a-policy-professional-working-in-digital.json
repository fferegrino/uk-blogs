After 5 years in policy, I joined the MHCLG Funding Service as a subject matter expert, helping the department deliver grants more effectively and efficiently.\u202fWhile the substance of my work has remained similar, the differences in approaches and ways of working have been stark.\u00a0"

As set out in MHCLG's strategic vision for digital, \u201cit is about working smarter, streamlining how we operate, making policies more responsive, and creating a culture of collaboration\u201d. Tom Loosemore, former Deputy Director at the Government Digital Service (GDS), defined \u2018digital\u2019 as: \u201capplying the culture, practices, processes and technologies of the Internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations\u201d.\u00a0"

From expecting online deliveries in a matter of days (or even minutes!) to feeling frustrated by clunky online forms, it\u2019s undeniable that we now expect things to be easier, better and faster.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "But as Loosemore\u2019s definition suggests, meeting these heightened expectations requires much more than just adopting new technology. It demands that we put users of our services at the heart of design.\u00a0"

            "text": "User-centred design lies at the core of digital ways of working \u2013 an iterative process where teams focus on users and their needs in each phase of design. Indeed, the first principle underpinning MHCLG\u2019s digital strategy is \u2018start with the needs of the user and value their knowledge\u2019. But, as the strategy emphasises, this approach can be applied beyond designing digital services.\u00a0"

A \u2018user\u2019 is anyone who interacts with a service \u2013 whether they are reading guidance on GOV.UK, applying for funding or implementing policy. This differs from stakeholders, who have an interest in, or might be affected by a policy, product or service, without experiencing it directly.\u00a0"

I\u2019m sure this context will be familiar to many policy and delivery teams, who are often seeking to tackle multi-faceted and seemingly intractable problems. As Pat McFadden, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, recently emphasised, civil servants need to develop a \u201ctest-and-learn mindset\u201d. Adopting an agile approach can help you do just that.\u00a0"
