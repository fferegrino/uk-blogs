            "text": "Today\u2019s newspapers prominently report that the Bill will ban non-disclosure agreements used by employers to stop employees from talking about their experiences of harassment and abuse at work. The story is on the front page of today\u2019s Guardian with an editorial hailing the change. Elsewhere it is reported by BBC online, Mirror\u00a0(p2), Financial Times (p2), Telegraph\u00a0(p2), Daily Mail (p4), Sky News, Times (p37, James Hurley), LBC with copy running in the Independent and regional media including the Evening Standard.

            "text": "There is also widespread positive coverage of bereavement leave being extended to those who experience pregnancy loss before 24 weeks - a compassionate change acknowledging that pregnancy loss grief can be just as profound at any stage. This story ran widely across print, online and national broadcast all day yesterday, with BBC News featuring interviews with campaigners such as Myleene Klass who has an MBE for her services to miscarriage awareness. She told the BBC the change was a \u201cmarker for all of the families who have been ignored\u201d as a topic often \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d."

Other outlets which positively report the news, include Women\u2019s Health, Glamour and Stylist who said the government has now taken a major step towards making its Every Loss Counts campaign a reality. Elsewhere, positive coverage featured in the Guardian (p6), Times (p4 & p37), The i Paper (p6), ITV News, Metro (p6), LBC and trade and regional media picked up from PA copy."

            "text": "Elsewhere, the Daily Mirror (p6)reports the government\u2019s action to strengthen new laws banning fire, rehire and replace tactics, by closing a loophole ensuring agency staff can\u2019t be used again to replace sacked employees after they refused worse terms and conditions. The Deputy PM also exclusively spoke to the paper (p6) about her mission to Make Work Pay and tackle exploitative employer practices like these, which largely affect the lowest paid workers."
