I\u2019ve been through my own menopause journey, and I\u2019m in a position now where I feel comfortable speaking about it publicly.

When symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life, your focus, your energy, your wellbeing - it can be really hard to find the resilience to speak up. If you\u2019re not sure how your manager or team will respond, it\u2019s understandable that many choose to say nothing. That\u2019s why we need to keep talking about this. It\u2019s about creating the kind of working culture where people know they\u2019ll be listened to, supported, and not judged."

As of 2024, 54.5% of our workforce are women. That\u2019s a clear signal of how widespread the impact of menopause can be, not just individually, but across teams and organisations."

            "text": "For me, one of the most important takeaways was the need to make sure we\u2019re creating environments where women feel able to talk about how they\u2019re feeling, describe their symptoms, and ask for help when they need it. If we don\u2019t do that, we risk people feeling isolated or unsupported and that affects their ability to engage and perform at their best."

They\u2019re often the first point of contact for someone struggling, and they need to know how to respond and where people can find more help and support. Supporting line managers to do that well is a big part of getting this right."
