Recent data also shows growing numbers of service owners operating at senior levels, meaning improvements to this role are likely to substantially benefit an increasing number of services, and citizen experiences, across the UK."

A key challenge was to reduce the potential for confusion and duplication between the service owner and product manager roles. These roles typically work closely together but have a different focus. By collaborating throughout the development of both roles, we made important changes, such as removing some shared skills, like \u2018product ownership\u2019, that didn\u2019t accurately reflect what both roles do."
