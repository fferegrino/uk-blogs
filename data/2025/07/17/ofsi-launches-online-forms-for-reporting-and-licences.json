While use of the online forms is not yet mandatory, we encourage all users to familiarise themselves with the new forms and start using them as soon as possible. To support this, we have also published downloadable versions of the new forms to preview the questions, which can also be completed and sent to us by email. Using these templates will help you get used to the new format and requirements ahead of the full transition. OFSI will provide ample notice before the old forms are phased out permanently, through e-alerts and updates to our website."
