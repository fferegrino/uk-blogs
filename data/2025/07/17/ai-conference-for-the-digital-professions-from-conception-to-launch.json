            "text": "We have all heard that AI is here to change our lives and transform the way we work. However, discussions have usually focused on an overarching picture of change rather than exploring how this change might apply to specific professions. This is the challenge we sought to tackle when our team set out to produce Justice Digital\u2019s first AI Conference for the Digital Professions."

            "text": "The conference could not have been more timely. It coincided with the publication of the AI Opportunities Action Plan, which saw HMG call for \u201cAI adoption across the UK to boost economic growth, provide jobs for the future, and improve people's everyday lives.\u201d"

            "text": "To bring the conference to life, we knew that we would have to offer truly valuable sessions. As such, our main aim was to reach out to several incredibly talented individuals from our department, cross-government, and industry. Although not everyone had the time to dedicate to our conference, our outreach saw 11 leading experts hosting sessions on a wide range of highly relevant topics."
        },
        {
            "text": "For example, one of our sessions focussed on Applying AI to User Research and explored the transformative role of Generative AI in helping User Researchers better understand user needs, whilst also balancing this against the technology\u2019s current limitations."
        },
        {
            "text": "We also had the opportunity to hear from a Senior Service Designer at the Bank of England, who led us through a fantastic session on AX (Artificial Intelligence Experience) and Service Design. She explored the ways in which AI can enhance user experience through prediction, automation, and personalisation. It was especially interesting to see AI explored as a \u2018suitcase term\u2019 and its role in supercharging creativity."
        },
        {
            "text": "Another inspiring session focused on effective AI Delivery and the challenges of moving AI products from conception to production and explored the role of scalable custom solutions and quantised AI models in enabling the government to deliver value to the public while reducing the cost and risk associated with AI deployment."
        },
        {
            "text": "Our final session provided Digital colleagues with a valuable introduction to Miro AI and its wide-ranging capabilities. From report generation and qualitative data analysis to the creation of diverse diagrams, including mind maps and flowcharts. The speakers guided us through its potential to streamline workflows and enhance efficiency. The session was particularly useful in giving Digital colleagues a taste of the software\u2019s capabilities before Justice Digital\u2019s Miro AI Pilot commenced shortly after.\u00a0"

            "text": "Following the positive response, we're excited to confirm the AI Conference will return in January 2026, this time, with an even broader audience. By opening it up to both civil servants and industry professionals, we hope to deepen collaboration, encourage open knowledge-sharing, and support the safe, effective use of AI across sectors."
