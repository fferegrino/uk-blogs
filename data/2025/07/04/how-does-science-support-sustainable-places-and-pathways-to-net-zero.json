Areas rich in natural resources will help to fuel low-carbon technologies, while others will become hubs for industry. Communities will navigate the transition to net zero in diverse and place-specific ways, shaped by their social, economic and environmental contexts. The place-based nature of net zero presents unique scientific challenges.\u00a0\u00a0"

Evidence tells us that meaningful, consultative, and transparent public engagement is critical to securing social support to operate.
