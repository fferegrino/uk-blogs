Although the Government has recently announced that it has taken one of its Green Paper proposals out of the current Bill which will deliver aspects of this reform, this advice remains pertinent.[1]"

A more tangible range of ambitions will not only provide certainty for claimants but will also be essential for the thousands of DWP staff who will be tasked with delivering these reforms on the ground."

Conflating these two purposes by using a test for one to grant the other needs a clearly articulated justification. The Minister for Social Security and Disability has subsequently announced that clause 5 would be removed from the Bill at Commons Committee stage and that no changes to PIP eligibility, activities and descriptors would be made before the completion of his review into PIP eligibility.[2]"

We have heard those concerns, and that is why I can announce that we are going to remove clause 5 from the Bill in Committee.
