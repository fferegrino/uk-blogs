Details of the government\u2019s intended approach to SEND reform will be set out in a schools white paper in the autumn, so making more fundamental changes to area SEND inspection methodology would have been premature. The changes we announced this month have so far been well received."

            "text": "We\u2019re also improving coordination with other inspection frameworks and with the DfE and NHS England regional teams to help make sure that, where areas are already subject to significant intervention and oversight, this is taken into account. For example, where an area is subject to monitoring activity under both the area SEND and inspection of local authority children\u2019s services (ILACS) frameworks, we will try to make sure we coordinate visits and inspections under each framework."

            "text": "But SEND and ILACS inspections are complex. Each looks \u2013 at a system level \u2013 at either SEND or child protection partnerships. This is different from an inspection at setting level (a school, for example), which looks at the identification, support and progress made by a cohort of children with SEND."

        {
            "text": "This isn\u2019t to say that we carry out different inspections in isolation from each other: far from it. Inspectors will consult the latest area SEND inspection report to understand the local context in which the setting they\u2019re inspecting operates. They\u2019ll then be able to focus their lines of enquiry accordingly."
