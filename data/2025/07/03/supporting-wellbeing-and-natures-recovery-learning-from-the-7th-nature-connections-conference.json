Initiatives like Nature Towns and Cities and the national Green Social Prescribing Programme engage communities in acting for nature while also bringing other benefits including health, wellbeing and social cohesion. \u00a0There are many community led examples too like the E2 Urban Garden project in Leicester, transforming derelict and contaminated land into a micro-scale public garden that is engaging and connecting people with nature and with each other."
