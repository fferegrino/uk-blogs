In today\u2019s blog we\u2019re exploring the fascinating history of how writing instruments have progressed through the ages, and the IP that made it possible.\u00a0"

While Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru secured the first patents in 1827, Lewis E. Waterman's development of the three-fissure feed system solved critical leakage problems that had limited earlier designs. The Waterman Pen Company continues to operate today, testament to the enduring value of this protected innovation.\u00a0"

When British firm J. Parker licensed B\u00edr\u00f3's patents in 1951, they helped establish the commercial foundation for truly affordable, reliable pens that functioned across diverse environments and surfaces.\u00a0"
