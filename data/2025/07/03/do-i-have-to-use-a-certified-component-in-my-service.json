Whilst an identity service might build its own app, it might use another company\u2019s service to do things like biometric liveness detection. We call those parts of services \u201ccomponent services\u201d, and they can be certified under the gamma (0.4) publication of the UK digital identities and attributes trust framework.\u00a0"

Whilst meeting the rules should be challenging, we don\u2019t want the process of getting certified itself to be difficult. To that end, the certification process that our approved Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) follow discourages auditors from re-evaluating things that have already been recently evaluated.\u00a0"

            "text": "If you have a certified component service within your own service, your CAB can rely on the pre-existing certification for that component service as part of the evaluation. This means the CAB may be able to reduce or, in some cases, completely avoid the effort involved in looking at that part of the service; they don\u2019t necessarily need to do a full evaluation, because those parts have already been looked at."
