Doing it now means maintenance jobs are easier to carry out than in the middle of winter, planning can happen without panic and storage requirements can be considered carefully."

Hot on the heels of a wet winter, many farmers had found their slurry storage under a lot of pressure. The very dry spring and summer this year has been the polar opposite, but it does tell us one thing we can rely on with the weather: past performance is not an indicator of future results \u2013 wet weather will be around the corner somewhere."

We strongly recommend having six months storage to be sure you can make it through with contingency to spare."
