My first job after graduation was working as a Water Resources Officer in East Anglia supporting the Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme, an Environment Agency asset that moves water from rivers in Norfolk to the rivers and reservoirs of Essex. Working in one of the driest parts of the country, and on a strategically significant water resources asset, left a lasting impression on me. I\u2019ve since brought that interest to the Chief Scientist\u2019s Group, where I\u2019ve been lucky to build a career investigating the current and future challenges around water resources and drought.\u00a0\u00a0"

As such, each drought is different.\u00a0\u00a0"
