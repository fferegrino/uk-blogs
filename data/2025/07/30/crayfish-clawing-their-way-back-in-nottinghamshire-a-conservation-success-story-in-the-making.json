            "text": "But this native species faces an existential threat. The introduction of the North American signal crayfish in the 1970s has had devastating consequences. These invasive crayfish don't just outcompete our native species for food and habitat, they carry a deadly fungal disease known as crayfish plague, to which white-clawed crayfish have no natural resistance."

Over the past few years, I've joined Nottinghamshire BAG for signal crayfish removal sessions in Bulwell, Nottingham. These sustained efforts are paying dividends and we're now seeing a noticeable decline in the invasive population in ponds at Bulwell Hall."

From this abundance, they were able to carefully select the 100 healthiest adult specimens (the maximum number able to be housed at the quarantine facility) within the required size range (15-40mm carapace length), ensuring a good gender ratio and age range."

Under the Natural England license requirements, rescued crayfish must spend a minimum of 28 days in quarantine to ensure they are disease-free before being released to ark sites. This crucial step prevents the accidental spread of plague to the protected sites."
