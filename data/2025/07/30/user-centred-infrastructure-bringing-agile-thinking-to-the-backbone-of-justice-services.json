It enables our teams to adapt quickly to changes in user needs, technology, or government policy. Through regular collaboration, reviews, analysis and user research, we\u2019re able to test assumptions, reduce risk, and build services that are accessible and genuinely meet the needs of the people who rely on them.\u00a0"

These are just as critical as the products themselves, so why do so many of us still default to project-based thinking and waterfall principles in these areas?\u00a0"

In short, the team is responsible for the live services, delivery, product changes and development of all networking, security, voice and video, and hosting services across the Ministry of Justice estate. With the support of my Deputy Director, Nava Ramanan, we are actively exploring how we can improve the way we operate and deliver these services.\u00a0"

Through this, we have identified key opportunities to create the space, support, and clarity our teams need to adopt more agile and product-led approaches. By doing so, we aim to unlock stronger collaboration, accelerate delivery, and drive more meaningful outcomes for our users and the wider organisation.\u00a0"

Shifting long held mindsets hasn't always been easy and at times, its meant challenging the very systems/processes and leadership styles we are part of. But by bringing agile and product thinking into our infrastructure teams, we have created the space for people to thrive. With 23 product and service teams now operating within DISO, we are fostering deep collaboration, sharper focus, and a renewed commitment to delivering meaningful outcomes. This is about more than modernisation. it\u2019s about strengthening people and services, so we leave them better than we found them\u201d.\u00a0 - Nava Ramanan\u00a0"
