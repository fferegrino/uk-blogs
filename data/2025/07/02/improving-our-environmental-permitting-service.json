We are committed to keeping all stakeholders informed of our progress and key developments, and permitting performance is tracked and shared via the annual Chief Regulator\u2019s Report. This ensures ongoing transparency and accountability of our regulatory performance. As England\u2019s principal environmental regulator, we\u2019re working closely with Defra to implement recommendations from recent reviews and consultations including moving water resources regulation into the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR), consulting on allowing us to set exemptions to increase regulatory agility, and reducing the complexity of bespoke permits to provide more options for trials and new technology. We\u2019re committed to playing a central role in the future of regulation."
