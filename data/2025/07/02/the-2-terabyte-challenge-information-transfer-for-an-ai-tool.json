My role in this team involved managing DBT\u2019s information lifecycle, from creation to deletion. A critical part of this is managing information as it reaches the end of its retention period\u00a0 and ensuring the department is compliant with the Public Records Act. While in the KIM team, I worked on the Machinery of Government (MoG) change. This experience proved useful when colleagues from KIM approached me with a new challenge: transferring 2TB of data to support the review of digital records, including with the use of AI. The request came shortly after we successfully migrated a significant quantity of information in the DBT SharePoint environment.\u00a0"

            "text": "Like all organisations, DBT faces the problem of adding gigabytes of information to our storage repositories every year. Reviewing this manually before transferring to the National Archives would be virtually impossible. While a single member of staff could review up to 6 paper files a day, an AI tool could support the review of vast quantities of information. It could also identify content duplication, assist in sensitivity review and potentially reduce significantly the amount of time needed to review the records. This demonstrates one of the ways in which DBT is realising the government\u2019s directive to innovate using AI."

            "text": "It can be quite easy to underestimate the vastness of information which can be obscured by terms like 'gigabyte' or 'terabyte'. If we were to print out 1TB of information, this would represent approximately 6.5 million pages.\u00a0With any migration or data transfer, there is a misconception that we can just press a button and the information zips from one place to another. The reality is that data must be downloaded, uploaded, read, written and transferred - each step with its own risks and constraints."

ShareGate is a very handy migration tool we can use within VM, so I used this to download information from SharePoint. However, then the information was \u2018stuck\u2019 on the Virtual Machine."

At that rate, I realised that I\u2019d probably be sending the hard drive as a Christmas present (not ideal in January).Finally, a colleague in Cyber helped me set up a blob storage container in Azure and configured the authentication. I then used the AzCopy PowerShell command to move the information from the VM into blob storage, repeating this to copy the information onto the hard drive. Over the course of several days, and many cups of coffee, I had successfully copied the information onto a hard drive."

Testing solutions before committing to a process helped avoid bigger issues later.

This experience reinforced the value of staying adaptable and the importance of documenting each step for future reference."
