That's where occupational psychology comes in. It's the science of understanding how people, groups, and organisations behave at work. The goal is simple: to make the working experience better for individuals and to make organisations more effective, without one being at the expense of the other."

We gather evidence from four key sources \u2014 organisational data, stakeholder information, scientific evidence, and practitioner expertise. We use all four because we're an applied science. This means we're doing real-world work to solve real-world problems for workers, teams, and organisations."

I had to be part of making that experience better for myself and as many others as possible. That's what started my career in occupational psychology, which has now lasted nearly 25 years, and I've no plans to stop now. Being part of the Government Occupational Psychology profession has given me a wonderful network, opportunities for professional and career development and roles across the Civil Service."
