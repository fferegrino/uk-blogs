This initiative directly supports our government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity by giving children the best start in life.

Shockingly, the most common reason for children aged 5 to 9 being admitted to hospital is to have treatment for decayed teeth."

With Colgate, we eventually settled on a new \u2018supporting NHS\u2019 brand, which will feature across educational materials and a joint dual-branded awareness campaign. \u00a0"
