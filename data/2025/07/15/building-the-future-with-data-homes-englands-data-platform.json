There is no technology nor fancy tool thatcan replace an accurate, timely dataset that has securely been ingestedthrough a reliable and robust data platform. Data engineers are thefoundation building block that enable others to do their job well. Asummary is provided below:"

            "text": "Imagine a user who wants to analyse a dataset. They might log into awebsite, download a file, and then create graphs or run some statisticsto uncover insights. At first glance, this seems like a reasonableapproach. But if they need to repeat this process daily, share the datawith colleagues, or combine it with other datasets, the workflow quicklybecomes time consuming, error prone, and potentiallyinsecure.This is where the power of Homes England\u2019s data platform comes intoplay. It provides a centralised, secure, and scalable environment thatautomatically ingests, processes, and stores data across theorganisation - eliminating repetitive manual tasks and enabling faster, more reliable access to trusted data.The platform currently supports the ingestion of data from a wide rangeof sources, including databases such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL andOracle. In addition to databases, it can also pull data from: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Microsoft Dataverse, Microsoft SharePoint sites and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The platform is scalable and adaptable to accommodate new data types as needs evolve.Now the data has been ingested, it needs to be stored. Homes Englanduses a cloud based storage solution, which ensures the platformremains scalable as data volumes increase. The data is stored in Deltaformat, a powerful structure that offers several advantages: it supportsefficient querying, simplifies version control through built in delta historytracking, and integrates seamlessly with analytics tools. WithinDatabricks, this data is presented as relational tables, making it easy forusers to explore and work with."

            "text": "This first stage of storage is known as the \u201craw\u201d layer, as it captures thedata exactly as it was received from the source. To prepare this data formeaningful analysis, the data engineering team collaborates closelywith data architects and agile project teams. Together, they transformthe raw data into structured fact and dimension tables, forming what\u2019sknown as the \u201ccurated\u201d layer. This refined layer is optimised for analysisand is what end users interact with to generate insights and drivedecisions. What starts as complex, varied data sources, is transformedinto a consistent, tabular format - clear rows and columns that areintuitive to navigate. This makes the data not only accessible but alsoreliable for analysis and decision making."
