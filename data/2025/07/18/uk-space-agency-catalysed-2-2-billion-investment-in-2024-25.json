Our Space Clusters Infrastructure Fund alone has catalysed over \u00a3700 million in projected private investment, with \u00a330 million raised in follow-up funding. These regional investments are expected to generate between \u00a30.5 billion and \u00a31 billion in revenue over the next decade, reinforcing the space sector's role as a key economic driver.\u00a0"

The UK Space Agency Accelerator, now in its fifth year, has supported 158 businesses in raising \u00a315 million in both private and grant funding. These companies have created jobs and driven innovation in a sector traditionally dominated by larger firms. Additionally, the Fusion: Connect with Capital programme has already enabled 12 early-stage companies to raise \u00a32.7 million in investment funding. Following the success of these programmes, we recently launched Shuttle to support revenue-generating UK SMEs.\u00a0"
