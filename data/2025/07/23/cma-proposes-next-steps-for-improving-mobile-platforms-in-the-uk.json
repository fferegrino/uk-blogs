As a result, the app economy is now an engine of UK growth, particularly in strategically important sectors like financial services and creative industries. Fintech stands out, with over half of all UK unicorns and more than \u00a318 billion in inward investment over the past 3 years. Meanwhile, the gaming sector adds \u00a36 billion in GVA, with its fastest-growing segment \u2013 mobile gaming \u2013 generating nearly \u00a32 billion annually.\u00a0"
