The goal of the hackathon was to integrate new AI tooling into pre-existing, open-source software developed by the French Government, known as La Suite num\u00e9rique. We created a fact-checking tool, that we prototyped to a panel of judges."

As such, FactVerifAI does not directly provide facts, but assists in identifying potentially verifiable claims within text and retrieving relevant evidence from web sources to aid verification."

The feedback reinforced Redbox's distinctive value as a reliable, capable and ethically-aligned AI assistant purposely designed to empower public sector innovation and decision-making. This visit represents an important step in DBT's AI roadmap. By showcasing tools like Redbox to international partners, we aim to facilitate knowledge exchange and identify areas for collaboration.\u00a0 This will contribute to building reliable, interoperable digital infrastructure to serve the wider European tech community."
