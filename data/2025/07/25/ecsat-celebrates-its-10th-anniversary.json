Engineers have begun testing the use of specialised remote-control robots in conditions that are potentially hazardous for humans but harmless for agile robots controlled from afar with 5G. Another potential application of this technology comes in the field of climate research. Since bodies of water are often isolated and poorly connected, ECSAT\u2019s improved 5G technology could aid scientists to monitor metrics such as salinity, pollution, and pH levels in water around the world and in real time.\u00a0"
