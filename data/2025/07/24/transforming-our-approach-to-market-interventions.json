One of the most powerful ways we do this is through our markets tools, which allow us to examine entire markets and identify opportunities to make them work better for consumers, businesses, and the wider economy."

            "text": "As we move beyond our first decade of markets work, now is the right time to reflect on how we use these tools and how we can do so even more effectively. We\u2019ve been making fundamental changes across the CMA to ensure our work supports economic growth, reduces uncertainty for businesses and investors, and delivers better outcomes for everyone."

            "text": "We\u2019ve already started embedding this approach across the rest of the CMA\u2019s work, including mergers, consumer protection and competition enforcement. In setting out how it will apply to our markets work, we are today completing the implementation of the 4Ps framework across the CMA\u2019s major tools."

        {
            "text": "This shift is timely. The UK government\u2019s Regulation Action Plan and the strategic steer to the CMA, both published in May 2025, emphasise the role of regulators in supporting economic growth. Our work should build consumer trust, deter poor corporate practices, and prioritise interventions that boost productivity and growth."

            "text": "Our markets tools are uniquely positioned to help us deliver on this; they are discretionary, so we can focus on markets with the greatest potential to support growth \u2013 such as civil engineering for road and rail, into which we have just launched a market study. By improving how competition functions in these markets, we encourage firms to innovate, invest, and raise productivity \u2013 often without the need for direct legislative or regulatory intervention."
        },
        {
            "text": "However, we\u2019re also mindful that our work can create uncertainty or impose burdens on businesses \u2013 especially if processes are lengthy or unclear, and so we\u2019re committing to minimise these impacts. For example, while the legislation that sits behind our markets work provides statutory time limits, this still means a market study could last up to 12 months, followed by a market investigation of up to 18 or 24 months. We are clear that an end-to-end process lasting, in some cases, up to 3 years is not consistent with minimising unnecessary burdens and uncertainty on businesses in the vast majority of cases. We must seek to complete our work as quickly as possible while securing benefits for consumers, businesses and the wider economy."

            "text": "At the conclusion of a project, we\u2019ll assess the costs of remedies more comprehensively, minimise compliance burdens, and put sunset clauses on remedies, removing them when they\u2019re no longer needed."
