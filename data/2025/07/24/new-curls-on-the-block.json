As a fellow curly girl, the content really resonated with me and I found myself reflecting on the remarkable evolution of curly hair products since 2016, when the blog was published. While some classic inventions like the diffuser are still a must for hair washing days, the innovators of today have certainly made the curly hair experience easier!"

            "text": "A defining curl cream is the foundation of my curly hair routine. The way it can take unruly, frizzy locks and create defined curls makes it an everyday essential, and these formulations are rich with IP. Many feature patented ingredient combinations, such as a formula for a cream that provides strong hold and moisture resistance, which is protected under\u00a0GB2581572A. One of my personal favourites, Bumble and Bumble\u00ae, offers strong hold for curls, and their branding helps them to stand out on busy shelves. Bumble and Bumble\u00ae have wisely protected their branding with trade marks such as UK00801262830 and UK00003335285."

My go-to product is Umberto Giannini's\u00ae Curl Jelly, a classic in what has become an extensive range of curl-specific products. This brand, named after its founder, has graced dressing tables for over two decades, and for me the products continue to represent quality curl care.Along with the rest of their products, Curl Jelly is well protected with trade marks. Umberto Giannini\u00ae not only have trade mark protection covering their brand name (UK00002176284), but also the specific product title 'Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly\u00ae' (UK00004155214), and a recently applied for figurative mark of their distinctive bottle lettering (UK00004173954). Their approach demonstrates that creating a product with staying power \u2013 both in curls and in the market \u2013 can be helped along when you have thorough trade mark protection."

Growing up with long, thick curls meant detangling was always a challenge. That was until this innovative brush (with its 400 specially designed teeth) came onto my radar, making removing the tangles from my hair a breeze."

            "text": "Perhaps the most significant shift in recent years has been the surge in sulphate-free formulations. The science supporting this change is compelling \u2013 sulphates strip natural oils from hair, particularly devastating for naturally moisture-deprived curly textures. Forward-thinking companies like Only Curls\u00ae have built their entire brand identity around this principle, developing formulations that cleanse effectively without drying."

Their multi-step routines promise optimal results when used together \u2013 a brilliant strategy that encourages consumers to invest in entire product ranges rather than buying individual items. "

        {
            "text": "But how do these companies protect their innovative formulations? Trade secrets can provide a valuable form of protection. For trade secret protection to apply, formulations must be carefully guarded and derive commercial value specifically from their confidentiality. Companies employing this strategy should ensure all parties involved \u2013 from suppliers and manufacturers to employees \u2013 sign comprehensive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). For practical guidance on implementing NDAs effectively, visit our dedicated NDA guidance\u00a0page."
