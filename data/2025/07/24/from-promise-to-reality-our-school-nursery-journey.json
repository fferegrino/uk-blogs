Our task was to turn a government promise into reality by creating thousands of new school-based nurseries. The government's Plan for Change identified our mission: breaking down barriers by giving children the best start in life. With one in three children starting school not ready to learn, we relished the opportunity to help bring about change."

We also worked alongside Strategic Communications, Central Capital Unit and Early Years Policies. This cross-functional approach created a foundation for meaningful progress that would have been impossible in isolation."

From September 2025, children of eligible working parents will be entitled to 30 hours of government funded childcare. This will apply from 9 months until they start school. Our work to grow the number of school-based nurseries is a valuable part of achieving this. It especially supports parents to find that childcare where they need it and helping children be school-ready.When a child walks confidently into their first day of school, ready to learn and eager to explore, that's everyone\u2019s success, including theirs."
