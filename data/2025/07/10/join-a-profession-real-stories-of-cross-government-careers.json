As part of Join a profession, our new initiative designed to help civil servants find their professional home, we\u2019ve asked colleagues to share their career highlights.

This work allows me to contribute to the department\u2019s strategic objectives and influence key decisions at the highest level. Continuous learning has been central to my progress \u2013 I\u2019ve worked on major projects, including redefining principal risks, renewing risk postures after the latest Spending Review, and supporting a Defence Board risk appetite session."

I\u2019m also proud to be continuing my professional development, having recently gained the Institute of Risk Management\u2019s International Certificate and continue working towards full accreditation. I regularly recommend the Induction Hub to colleagues as a starting point in the profession and completing the induction steps also gives you an Affiliate badge, which you can proudly display in your signature to demonstrate being part of the profession.\u201dAnis Khaldoun, Risk Specialist, Ministry of Defence"
