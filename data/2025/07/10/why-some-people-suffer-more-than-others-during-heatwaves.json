When it\u2019s hot, more blood flows close to the skin and we lose heat.\u00a0 This requires the heart to work harder to get the blood moving closer to the skin which can put it under strain."

This happens because when the body tries to cool itself down, it puts additional strain on organs that may already be under pressure. For example, people with heart disease may find it harder to maintain adequate blood flow, leading to chest pain or even heart failure. Similarly, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma may struggle to breathe as hot air, pollution, and dehydration combine to inflame the airways and reduce oxygen intake."

It is important to understand how your medication affects your body\u2019s response to heat and reread any instructions or speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns."

Consider shading or covering windows, opening them on either side of the building when the air outside feels cooler (particularly at night) to improve air circulation, and using electric fans when temperatures are below 35\u00b0C, though avoid pointing them directly at your body to prevent dehydration. Reduce internal heat by switching off unnecessary lights and electrical equipment, as well as considering cooking during cooler parts of the day. Moving to cooler areas of your home for activities like sleeping can help."
