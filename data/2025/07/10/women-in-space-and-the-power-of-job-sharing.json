These include overcoming the loneliness of leadership, having two brains to find creative solutions to thorny problems, knowing that the whole week is covered to better balance work and family commitments, and bringing complementary strengths to have more impact together. These in turn benefit the business which leads to higher productivity and innovation, a chance to draw from a wider talent pool, and improves diversity across grades.\u00a0\u00a0"
