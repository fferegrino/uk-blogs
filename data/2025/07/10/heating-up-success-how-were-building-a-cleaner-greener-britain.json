But what we're doing with the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) is genuinely transforming homes across England and Wales, with \u00a37,500 grants to help cover the cost of installing low carbon heat pumps."

Since launching in April 2022, we've supported more than 50,000 installations across England and Wales, and since July, we've been inundated with 33,000+ more heat pump applications and paid out over 22,000 grants. Every morning I check our dashboard thinking, \"That's another street, another town moving towards clean power and net zero.\"\u00a0"

I was in a taxi recently when the driver mentioned our ads, asking me loads of questions about heat pumps \u2013 we're definitely cutting through. Even at a recent family party, my proud relatives didn\u2019t hold back, asking questions, which reminded me why this matters so much."

Our Campaigns team in the Communications Directorate got busy behind the scenes, working with Emmerdale and ITV to bring this story to life, tying in with the department\u2019s ongoing \u2018Warm and Fuzzy\u2019 advertising campaign.\u00a0"
