Catamaran was the part of the exercise to take place in the UK, at Braunton Burrows Training Area in North Devon. The training saw amphibious landings, realistic battle scenarios, vehicle training and a significant aircraft presence flying above the area.\u00a0\u00a0"

Seeing this principle in action with more than 3,000 troops from 9 nations working together \u2013 demonstrated exactly why these collaborative relationships are so vital to our defence capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0"

Unlike many of our training areas, we lease the land at Braunton Burrows, which means we cannot shut areas off to the public during military exercises. Where other sites might use red flags and lights to prevent public access, at Braunton, the team must be innovative, engaging directly with visitors to ensure their safety while not disrupting training exercises. This delicate balancing act is handled with remarkable professionalism.\u00a0\u00a0"

Much of the infrastructure used by them during 1943 is still standing today, including concrete landing craft and a bazooka training wall.\u00a0\u00a0"

When you step back and consider all the activity that is happening at sea, in the air and across the sand dunes, it is remarkable what has been achieved. This work demonstrates DIO\u2019s ability to support complex military requirements while maintaining our commitment to public access.\u00a0\u00a0"
