            "text": "The recent publication of the Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS) for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight marks a major milestone in our collective mission to restore nature across England. They both showcase what can be achieved when local communities, experts and organisations work together to agree where action and investment in nature should be focused."

            "text": "48 responsible authorities\u00a0have been appointed to develop their strategies, covering the whole of England with no gaps or overlaps. LNRSs are led by local government and shaped by communities and local partners but informed by our wider national environmental targets. They provide a roadmap for cost-effective, nature-based solutions that deliver meaningful, lasting change for both people and the planet."
        },
        {
            "text": "So far, four of the 48 strategies have been published \u2013 with the remainder expected to be published this year. All the strategies must prioritise and target nature recovery action to address biodiversity loss and issues experienced by local people that are exacerbated by climate change, including flooding, poor water quality and unequal access to green space."

            "text": "By agreeing the most impactful locations for nature recovery, LNRSs guide action and investment in nature at every scale - from community-led initiatives to landscape-scale habitat restoration projects. Ultimately, they will create a national framework for nature recovery."

Both newly published strategies feature interactive maps, videos and other visually engaging materials, providing stand-out examples of engaging content that can inspire and be followed by other responsible authorities in their own strategies."

Buyers can fund the outcomes they need \u2013 such as carbon storage or flood mitigation \u2013 while suppliers deliver projects that provide those services."

Guided by the LNRS, these efforts are targeted, coordinated, and measurable - delivering real benefits to both people and nature."

It identifies actions that enable nature to thrive alongside sustainable development.

            "text": "The Isle of Wight LNRS shows how nature-based solutions can address urgent challenges caused by climate change. By working with the natural flow of rivers and floodplains and creating space for wetlands to expand, the strategy identifies action needed to help protect communities from flooding."

Already, the Isle of Wight LNRS is informing exciting bids\u00a0for landscape-scale nature recovery funding, bringing growth to rural and urban Island communities."

On the Isle of Wight, the Council\u00a0ran webinars, workshops, surveys, and public events \u2013 from garden fairs to sheepdog trials \u2013 to engage the public. This inclusive and often innovative process has ensured that the strategy reflects the needs of the community, especially those working with the land."
