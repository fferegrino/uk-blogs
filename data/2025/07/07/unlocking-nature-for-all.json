Improving access to the outdoors is vitally important, because by increasing our connection to nature we can improve health and wellbeing on a national scale, drive nature\u2019s recovery and contribute to a thriving economy for all."

There is a wide variety of habitats of national importance within the 159-hectare site such as chalk grassland, mixed scrub and ancient beech woodland. \u00a0These diverse environments make the reserve special by supporting an amazing diversity of flower, bird and insect species.
