            "text": "Entangled with these environmental changes is the evidence for the evolution of life. England boasts an exceptionally rich fossil record for its size, from trilobites and dinosaurs to the ancestors of modern humans. This rich fossil diversity proved pivotal in developing the scientific study of rocks (geology) and past life (palaeontology)."

Well, through our collaborative work with academic partners in England's network of National Nature Reserves (NNRs), we are examining the ways in which fossils, can inform the conservation, management and reintroduction of species - such as beavers - on our nature reserves."

In 1824, a professor at the University of Oxford, William Buckland, described Megalosaurus based on fossils from Stonesfield \u2014 the first formally named dinosaur. Due to the scientific significance of these fossils, the site is now protected as an SSSI."

        {
            "text": "Led by partners at the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford, the dig discovered over 200 fossilised footprints in five distinct trackways. Four trackways were made by large herbivorous dinosaurs called sauropods and one by the carnivorous Megalosaurus. Trackways were first described at Ardley in the late 1990s and were protected as an SSSI in 2010 due to their scientific importance. "

            "text": "The SSSI designation enabled a management plan to be implemented to ensure that future findings were reported to researchers - setting the stage for the most recent set of trackway discoveries. The excavation was broadcast on BBC Two's Digging for Britain with Alice Roberts in January 2025, enabling a broad audience to engage with English fossil heritage."

The museum also has the Megalosaurus fossils found by William Buckland, which were used in the first descriptions of dinosaurs in its collections and on display."

Here, visitors can follow in the footsteps of paleontological pioneers like Mary Anning, collect fossils, and connect with nature through the history of life."
