Thankfully it didn\u2019t disappoint! The episode was absolutely packed with innovative businesses and creative entrepreneurs, but it was one pitch in particular that really caught my attention and had me leaning forward in my chair.\u00a0"

Eleven-year-old Max is the inventor of the Fidget-T, a solution for helping neurodiverse people \u2018stim\u2019 wherever they are by playing with pop-able fidget toys built into clothing hems. Stimming is the name given to repetitive physical movements, sounds or actions that help individuals self-regulate emotions and process sensory input. It\u2019s commonly associated with autism and other forms of neurodivergence.\u00a0 "

I was spending a fortune replacing clothes and desperately hunting for an alternative when I came across Max and Matt\u2019s Comfa brand.\u00a0"

Sara Davies agreed, stating that she thinks that the duo are on to \u201csomething massive\u201d if they go down the route of licensing their products.\u00a0"

            "text": "A licence is an agreement that can be used to allow another company to use your patented technology in exchange for fees or royalties. This enables you to generate revenue without losing ownership of your IP. By licensing your patent, you share the risks and costs of bringing products to market whilst accessing new territories and markets you might not otherwise reach.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Whether you choose exclusive licensing to one partner or non-exclusive arrangements with multiple parties, licensing can provide valuable income streams and collaborative opportunities. However, it's essential to seek professional legal advice to ensure your licensing agreements protect your interests and maximise the commercial value of your innovations.
