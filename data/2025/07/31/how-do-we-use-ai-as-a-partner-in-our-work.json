By automating tasks and acting as a soundboard for ideas, AI allows designers to focus on creativity while delivering work at a faster pace. This blog explains how we use AI in our work."

It allows professionals to securely input data to draft text, plans, and ideas while ensuring confidentiality. With pre-engineered prompts tailored to common communication tasks, Assist enables both experienced and novice users to streamline time-consuming work, freeing up more time for creative and strategic thinking."

For instance, one team member used Photoshop\u2019s generative AI to turn a close-up photo of a nurse at a computer into a scene with realistic details like a desk, chair, and ceiling. The same tools have been used to enhance images by extending backgrounds and removing unwanted objects, as well as replacing stock imagery to avoid photoshoot costs.\u00a0"

For example, we used Adobe Firefly to generate illustrations to test an envisioned style across different themes for a mood board. This allowed the team to explore multiple directions without fully developing each one. This approach saves time, especially for projects that require numerous thematic variations.\u00a0"

For example, in a project that required a list of safety-related items, ChatGPT helped compile and refine ideas for the items. It\u2019s also proven valuable in generating icon concepts for abstract themes for projects, such as \u2018decarbonisation\u2019 and genders, where finding the appropriate visual representation can be difficult. ChatGPT\u2019s ability to generate fresh ideas enhances creative processes and provides a foundation for further development."

Some team members use ChatGPT to improve their structure and written explanations of design ideas, making communication clearer and supporting the copy team\u2019s collaboration. Another use of ChatGPT is to simplify complex emails and briefs, making it easier to extract key points and understand project requirements. This puts designers in the best position to drive their work forward to meet our client\u2019s expectations.\u00a0"

For instance, some tools may struggle with complex elements, producing distorted or unrealistic results. Often images of people do not contain sufficient diversity, which needs checking. Similarly, text-based AI, while excellent for idea-generation and drafting, can occasionally produce content that feels impersonal or generic, requiring time spent on refinement.\u00a0"
