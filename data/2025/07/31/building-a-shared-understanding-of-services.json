            "text": "Services are how Defra group achieves most of its outcomes but understanding what we mean by a \u2018service\u2019 can be hard. People can have different definitions for services, products, capabilities or components. Parts of a service can mean different things to different people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing a list of definitions in a \u2018service taxonomy model\u2019 to build shared understanding. In this blog post, we\u2019ll discuss what we want to achieve, how we\u2019re working together to develop a model and what we\u2019ve learned so far."

            "text": "The service taxonomy is a model. It will never be a perfect picture of a complex reality but it\u2019s still useful. To start with, we want to use the model to help us develop a shared language. A common understanding of how services enable us to achieve outcomes while meeting user needs. We want to grow awareness of the different parts of a service to support colleagues. We also want to show the difference between products and services and how they work together because colleagues told us this would be helpful. It matters because transforming services is a team sport. We can be more effective and efficient when we\u2019re all working and communicating well together.\u00a0"

            "text": "The model is in support of the Defra Group digital and data transformation strategy and senior service ownership and service mapping work that we\u2019ve shared plans about. It is also in support of a blueprint for modern digital government, which talks of the need to join up public sector services. Plus, it uses the new cross-government definition of service from the Service Manual."

        {
            "text": "The model shows high-level groupings, not all the details within each layer. Different professions such as architecture or design may have their own ways of mapping. This is not intended to replace those, it\u2019s just a way of working together to create a shared understanding or view. In future, we hope to use the model not only to build shared understanding but also shared commonality and reusability in services."

            "text": "The service taxonomy model was first shared internally in September 2024. Since then, we\u2019ve collected feedback from colleagues. This led us to make changes by working together with those who will use the model. We\u2019re now sharing a second version. Of course, it\u2019s still not perfect but it is helping to move us forward on our service transformation journey. We are learning how the model helps us to have better conversations across organisational boundaries and between different professions. We are also learning how the model comes alive though real-world use. In future we will make more changes because the model should always evolve to meet our needs."
