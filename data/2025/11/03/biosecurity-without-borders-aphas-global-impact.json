            "text": "If you are an avid reader of APHA blogs, you will be aware that the Animal and Plant Health Agency co-ordinates the government response to any disease outbreak affecting animals in Great Britain. At the heart of this response is APHA\u2019s dedicated emergency team, always on alert for high-risk animal diseases, called the National Emergency Epidemiology Group (NEEG). The actions of this group are vitally important to ensure livestock, wildlife and pets\u00a0are protected from any escalating disease situations. Their swift and coordinated actions are crucial to protecting livestock, wildlife, and pets from escalating threats. By implementing robust control measures, enhancing biosecurity, and working to limit the spread of disease, NEEG helps safeguard animal and public health, support related industries, and reduce economic impact."

Delegates included veterinarians, public health officials, epidemiologists and other professionals, outlining the importance of One Health collaborative works."

            "text": "This workshop was part of the APHA\u2019s Animal Health Systems Strengthening (AHSS) programme, the aim of which is to reduce poverty and increase resilience to climate change through greater protection of animals from disease. Changes in climate can increase risks to certain diseases and decrease animal resistance to disease. Early identification of outbreaks and effective control reduce animal loss and financial losses to the farmer. They also protect the consumer from high food prices and zoonotic disease. During this visit the NEEG team shared their expert knowledge in disease control with the Ghanaian delegation. This included an emphasis on High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) in particular, as mitigating the risks from this will support the high-profile national policy to increase poultry production and reduce reliance on food imports. \u00a0"

This state-of-the-art facility will serve as a hub for cutting-edge research, diagnostics, and disease response, enhancing our ability to detect, assess, and contain emerging animal diseases with zoonotic potential. By bringing together experts in a wide range of specialised scientific fields, the centre will foster interdisciplinary collaboration essential to tackling complex biosecurity challenges.\u00a0"

Its enhanced capabilities will help ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of global efforts to protect animal and human health, safeguard food systems, and build resilience against future outbreaks. As the threats posed by climate change and globalisation continue to evolve, APHA Weybridge stands ready to lead the way in delivering a robust, coordinated, and science-driven response.\u00a0"
