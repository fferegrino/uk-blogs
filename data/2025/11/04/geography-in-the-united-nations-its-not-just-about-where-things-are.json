We gather to thrash out the big issues: how countries collect, share, and use geospatial data to inform everything from urban planning and public health to disaster response and climate action and how we can build capacity and share knowledge across the globe.\u00a0"

The answer is simple: being able to answer the question \u201cwhere?\u201d is essential to nearly all aspects of people\u2019s lives. Being at the table means we can influence international geospatial policy, maintain the trusted relationships we\u2019ve built over decades (or indeed centuries when you think several of our key organisations in this field, including Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey that were founded in 1791 and 1835 respectively), and expand our networks with other member states and organisations. It\u2019s about making sure the UK\u2019s voice is heard, and that we\u2019re shaping the future of global geospatial information and making sure that no one is left behind.\u00a0"

At the same time, the US has been stepping back from multilateral processes resulting in a much smaller delegation at this year\u2019s session who we have worked extremely closely with over the last 15 years further compounding the impact of a smaller Secretariat.\u00a0\u00a0"
