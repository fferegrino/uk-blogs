While their small, shiny appearance may seem harmless, these batteries can be deceptively hazardous when in the hands of curious young children and vulnerable adults, due to risk of swallowing them.\u00a0"

This has driven research into innovative detection methods, such as dyes that alert caregivers by changing saliva colour if a battery has been swallowed, and markers that make batteries stand out on x-rays to reduce misdiagnosis with similar objects like coins. While dye-based methods are potentially effective and affordable, more research outside of the laboratory is needed. Researchers are exploring the use of X-ray markers, and this idea is still in its early stages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
