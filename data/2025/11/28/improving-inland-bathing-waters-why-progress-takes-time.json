Prior to designation a river bathing water will not have been managed for faecal indicator organisms (FIO\u2019s) before. FIO\u2019s are bacterial indicators of faecal contamination that have been linked to people becoming ill. They can come from a variety of sources including sewage, agricultural livestock or wildlife. This evidence is essential before the right measures can be identified."
