The Pathfinders are exploring how bringing together social workers and practitioners from backgrounds like education, health, and youth work can create better outcomes for families. Our Family Help teams match each family with the right practitioner for their needs.Here, we share the combined experiences of several Family Help Lead Practitioners to illustrate what a typical day looks like for alternatively qualified practitioners in our roles."

I review the minutes from our last meeting \u2013 it's always powerful to see how far a family has come when we track progress together."
