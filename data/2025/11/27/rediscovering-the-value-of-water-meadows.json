We arrived early to catch the dramatic light of a low-sun spilling across the undulating water meadows. The weather was perfect and I got a drone up into the air to gain the aerial perspective. From this, I\u2019ve produced a video showcasing the uniqueness of historic water meadows as a habitat, as an agricultural technique, as a community asset and celebrate the incredible dedication of the people who manage them."

Hadrian Cook (Harnham Water Meadows Trust) explains that the meadows at Harnham are thought to be around 400 years old. Located on the western edge of Salisbury, the meadows sit within the River Nadder system and span around 100 acres.\u00a0\u00a0"

This process, known as \u2018drowning,\u2019 warms the grass, deposits nutrient-rich silt and provides oxygen to the soil, stimulating early grass growth \u2013 a term known as \u2018early bite.\u2019 Historically this helped support more livestock through the winter months which otherwise would have had to have been slaughtered.\u00a0"

This agreement supports the water meadow management and specifically the need to drown the meadows in the early part of the year in alternate weeks over a 6\u20138-week period. Volunteers manage the sluices daily during this period to ensure the water keeps flowing to avoid the water stagnating and negatively impacting grass growth.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Traditionally livestock would have grazed the early bite and then the water meadow may have been drowned again to stimulate grass for a hay crop. Water meadows like Harnham supported what\u2019s known as a sheep-corn system. The meadows were grazed in the day by sheep which were then taken off around 4pm to fold overnight in nearby barley and corn fields. This was an efficient way of transporting the fertility provided by the flooding, onto the arable land and caused significant increases in crop yield. Good for the water meadow habitat, good for water quality, good for agricultural production. This is regenerative farming at its core.\u00a0"

            "text": "Of course, the medieval economy and society relied much more heavily on horses and draft animals than it does today. Hay was an essential and valuable commodity to keep these animals alive outside of the growing season, and water meadows were an intensive way of producing hay at times when other grasslands were unsuited to do so."

            "text": "Harnessing the fertility and production potential of the water meadows was labour intensive. Naturally, the cost/benefit of this effort shifted following the industrial revolution at the latter end of the 19th century. Agriculture became more mechanised and horses less essential for day-to-day life. As expected, traditional water meadow management dropped off at this point in history.\u00a0\u00a0"

They can support nature recovery, by providing habitat for plants and animals, they improve health and wellbeing by fostering community engagement with nature, and they deliver security through nature, providing flood storage and cleaning river water. Harnessing these benefits is only possible through working closely in partnership with communities, in this case the Harnham Water Meadows Trust who provide expert local knowledge to operate the meadows and engage their communities.\u00a0"

Striking the right balance and unlocking the potential of each water meadow site is not simple and requires expert case-by-case advice. Something we at Natural England aim to support with.\u00a0\u00a0"
