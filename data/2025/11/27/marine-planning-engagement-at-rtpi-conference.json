These discussions offered valuable insights into integrating sustainable approaches into planning and policy-making, particularly in coastal and marine contexts."

            "text": "Interactive Marine Spatial Planning Workshop \u2013 Positive FeedbackFor the workshop, Mae and Ellie, Coastal Planners for the south west marine plan area, delivered an adapted version of our Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) challenge. Delegates stepped into the shoes of different marine stakeholders, such as fishers, offshore wind developers, and tourism operators, to explore the complexities of balancing sector priorities with environmental and social goals. Participants who played the role of Marine Planners used a decision-making framework they created for activities to prioritise or deprioritise, drawing on their own experience and expertise to balance economic, environmental, and social objectives."
