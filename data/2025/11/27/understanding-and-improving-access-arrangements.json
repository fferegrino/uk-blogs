            "text": "Back in July we withdrew our official statistics on access arrangements for GCSEs, AS and A levels covering 2014 to 2024, after identifying significant issues with how data had been recorded and reported. Today we are pleased to be following that up by publishing revised statistics, alongside new research and a regulatory report that confirms what we expect from exam boards. The report sets out several specific areas where we believe improvements can be made."

            "text": "As we explained in July, previous figures did not give an accurate picture of the number of students receiving access arrangements within a specific year\u2019s exam cohort. This was not because arrangements were being granted inappropriately, but rather due to limitations of the data source we used for our reporting. These included counting students who held valid arrangements but didn't sit exams in the given year, and not being able to filter out duplicate applications."

            "text": "The new statistics \u2013 for the 2024 to 2025 academic year and going back to 2015 to 2016 \u2013 use an improved methodology that focuses only on arrangements granted to students who were actually assessed in each year. They show that 25% extra time was granted for 16.6% to 25.5% of all students being assessed in 2024 to 2025, compared with 14.7% to 20.6% in 2023 to 2024."

            "text": "This means the proportion of exam students with an approval for 25% extra time is lower than the previous data suggested, and broadly in line with the rate of special educational needs (SEN) in the student population (as reported by the Department for Education)."

We wanted to better understand this, and to identify anything that could be done to improve the system."

        {
            "text": "So our research, data and policy experts went to work, analysing the available evidence and data. Our work focused on the granting of 25% extra time in exams, as this is the most common exam-board approved arrangement, as well as the concept of time in assessment."

            "text": "Our research found limited evidence of students experiencing time pressure (also known as \u201cspeededness\u201d) in GCSE, AS and A level exams, although this varied across subjects and student groups. While these exams are not designed to assess students' ability to work under time pressure, the interaction between exam tasks, duration and individual students can create unintended speededness for some students."

            "text": "We heard a range of views about the current system, including concerns from schools and colleges about the increasing workload and costs involved in identifying appropriate arrangements, evidencing student need, and administering access arrangements."

        {
            "text": "There was, however, support for the core principle that access arrangements should be based on a student\u2019s individual needs. The system generally meets this purpose, but we have identified some aspects which could be improved."

We will also take this into account in setting our requirements for the proposed new post-16 qualifications, such as V levels. We will confirm our regulatory expectations for exam boards following that work."
