            "text": "Electronic Monitoring, often known as tagging, helps the justice system track offenders in the community and supports rehabilitation. The EM Data Science team uses this information to develop insights and tools that help practitioners make safer, more informed, and more timely decisions. This work directly supports public protection and contributes to smoother, more efficient justice services."

            "text": "When I joined the team in July 2023, product management in data science was still quite new at the Ministry of Justice. Our product manager had recently stepped up from an associate role, and I joined as her associate product manager (APM), at the time, the only one across MoJ."

            "text": "The team I joined was analytical, highly efficient, and deeply skilled in its field. It delivered innovative work at pace and produced high-quality insights. But, like many data science teams, we started with data rather than users. We were experts at discovering what the data could tell us; now we needed to learn how to turn those insights into products that directly met user needs."

Overnight, I became a kind of stand-in PM, sharing responsibilities with our lead data scientists. They made strategic decisions while I looked after delivery, sprint ceremonies, and stakeholder engagement."

        {
            "text": "It wasn\u2019t always straightforward. Product management in a data science team sits somewhere between delivery, design and coordination. But together we kept things moving, balancing technical expertise with product thinking and making decisions based on evidence and outcomes rather than just technical milestones."

            "text": "At that point, there was no digital capacity to build anything new, and at the time there was no allocated funding. Rather than stop, we explored what we could do ourselves. Drawing on previous coding experience, I helped the team create simple prototypes using the Government Design System. These mock-ups weren\u2019t production-ready, but they helped others see the potential."

            "text": "That made a difference. By showing what the future could look like, we caught the attention of senior stakeholders. In late 2024, funding was released to bring in digital roles so we could build something properly."

Before we could build, we needed to go through a Government Digital Service (GDS) Discovery which was the first stage in the GDS process that helps teams understand the problem and users before developing a solution."

            "text": "Working closely with a new design team - a user researcher, content designer and interaction designer, we reviewed what we already knew and where the gaps were. We had a lot of analysis, but it wasn\u2019t yet structured around user needs. Together we reshaped the evidence, passed our Discovery assessment in early 2025, and started our Alpha, where we tested our assumptions and began creating prototypes with users."

            "text": "As the digital side of the team learned about data models and pipelines, we realised that they were also navigating new ground. To help build shared understanding, our data scientists ran a workshop for our digital colleagues. They explained, in simple terms, how a model is trained, how we review algorithms through consultation panels, and how we apply our ethics framework to identify and manage potential bias."
        },
        {
            "text": "That session sparked curiosity and respect on both sides. The digital specialists began to appreciate the rigor and governance that sit behind data science. In turn, the data scientists started to see how user research and iterative design could make their work more practical and impactful."

We share the same vision: digital by design, data-driven by default, resilient by necessity, and focused on building services that are user-centered, secure and future-ready."

            "text": "We learned that every design decision needs evidence from users, not just technical justification. We also learned that user-centered design takes time, iteration and sometimes the discipline to narrow focus so that you can go deeper on what matters most."
