Yet when it comes to exporting and scaling up, finding the time to understand the process can be daunting. Small Business Saturday is held on the first Saturday in December, but its impact extends beyond this as a national effort to highlight small businesses' contributions to our communities and economy. This blog discusses how the Department for Business and Trade\u2019s (DBT's) digital team works to help these businesses all year round."

Powered by artificial intelligence, it provides instant, authoritative answers to a wide range of export-related questions. The chatbot is in the Private-Beta testing stage, meaning that it is currently available by invite only to a small number of randomly selected business.gov.uk account holders."

We hope to learn about the types of questions asked, how they are phrased, and understand the expectations of responses provided. By analysing the questions and responses, we can refine the chatbot\u2019s performance and enable it to provide even better responses over future iterations."

While chatbots can be spun up in less than an hour, accuracy and trust are paramount and this requires work. The chatbot draws exclusively from verified government and partner sources with the relevant citation - to ensure that businesses receive accurate and up-to-date information. \u00a0These safeguards have helped us maintain trust and transparency in the chatbot. They have also allowed us to better understand the types of questions that the chatbot will respond to, and those that it will not."

Businesses appreciate the speed and clarity of the chatbot\u2019s responses, because it often brings multiple sources of information together from various sources.

These include assistance in understanding finance options and how to access them, help navigating and understanding the regulations that apply to running a business, and support by providing onwards journeys onto network and partner services available to them. \u00a0By bringing all this trusted information together for small businesses, we hope that the chatbot can have a real impact in allowing small businesses across the UK to scale up and make the most of global growth opportunities. This is something we should celebrate on Small Business Saturday and all year round."
