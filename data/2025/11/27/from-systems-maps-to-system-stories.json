            "text": "But systems maps can be visually overwhelming, often only making sense to those making them. The Foresight Obesity Systems Map is an often-quoted example of this. As a result, they can sometimes feel alienating and ultimately lose their value and impact."

An important part of the workshop was printing off our insights as individual \u2018nuggets\u2019 or \u2018evidence cards\u2019. In the first part of the workshop, we used simple card swapping activities to socialise the evidence base and get colleagues familiar with the breath of insights."

This framing allowed us to identify and share new challenge questions (\u2018how might we...\u2019) with the policy team to stimulate new thinking, ideas and hypotheses to test. "

That is already working to flip the system stories, addressing some of its delivery risks. This highlighted an important aspect of systems thinking, which is considering where to usefully draw the boundary to a system, which might involve challenging assumptions and silos."

It was also an active way of demonstrating the value of a multidisciplinary team upstream in the policy space."

            "text": "We heard feedback during the evidence discovery that the visual images we used to theme the evidence helped people navigate and review the volume of evidence quickly. Similarly, we heard that the physical, tactile quality of printed evidence cards and the card swapping activities helped people digest and explore the insights in a more meaningful way than online workshops. These things reminded us of the value of investing in face-to-face working at points in a project when collective understanding and buy-in are critical to moving work forward."

However, on reflection, we\u2019re learning that policy colleagues can often be more compelled to action by \u2018risks\u2019 and \u2018mitigations\u2019. This is an interesting and important learning for us about policymaker motivations, and how to inspire action from research and insights."

Instead, we stuck with plain English, describing the logical next step of \u2018mapping\u2019 the evidence after our earlier evidence discovery workshop."
