The project explored how large, complex organisations approach development of data strategies \u2013 their ambitions, challenges and practical choices."

            "text": "As Soumaya and Michal highlighted in their blog about building better data platforms, at DBT we already have established tools and infrastructure for processing data. As a rule, our systems don\u2019t tend to process high volumes of real-time data. Instead, our focus to date has been on quality, and on bringing diverse datasets together to gain new insights and better support UK businesses."

            "text": "Many of the organisations we spoke to began with a centralised approach to processing data. DBT has followed a similar path through our central data platform, Data Workspace. However, we observed a clear move towards decentralisation, particularly in more mature data organisations."

        {
            "text": "This makes sense \u2013 putting data in the hands of the people who know it best \u2013 but it can lead to inconsistencies in how data is processed and shared. We saw a wide variety of data ingestion approaches.\u00a0 These ranged from using advanced tools like Apache Airflow or Kafka, to Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or even bulk-uploading spreadsheets."
        },

        },
        {
            "text": "Public sector teams recognised the value of data sharing but were often constrained by the technology available to them. There was strong recognition that manual bulk data sharing should be avoided, in favour of access to data through automated Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, there is not always an easy way to get there."

            "text": "Data retention was not a primary focus for many of the teams we spoke to, often because it sits with adjacent teams in data protection or knowledge and information management. Still, we found that retention practices vary significantly across government and that teams are keen to improve consistency."

            "text": "Fortunately, DBT is a relatively young organisation and does not hold large volumes of legacy data.

One promising solution for improving data sharing between public sector organisations is X-Road - an open-source solution that offers secure, real-time exchange of data via APIs. This could address many of the usual technology and governance barriers to data sharing."

            "text": "By exploring how other governments around the world are using X-Road, we gained insight on how it - or a similar technology - might work for DBT. Success would depend on clear coordination between departments, established API gateways, shared standards and secure access controls."
