One pest you need to know about is Ips typographus, commonly known as the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle. This beetle represents a significant threat to spruce trees across Great Britain."

            "text": "Ips typographus is classified as a quarantine pest in the UK, meaning we're legally obligated to act against any findings to prevent its establishment. This beetle specifically targets spruce tree species and could have devastating effects on our forestry sector if it becomes established."

            "text": "The numbers speak for themselves: spruce makes up 60% of the conifer crop across Great Britain, with a total estimated value of \u00a32.9 billion per annum, supporting thousands of jobs across the country.1 This includes economic, social and environmental benefits, with around \u00a3350 million annually coming from timber revenue alone.2"

        {
            "text": "Evidence shows that outbreaks since 2018 have resulted from natural dispersal \u2013 essentially, beetles being blown over by the wind from continental Europe, where the pest is native, during favourable weather conditions. There's currently no evidence of the pest spreading within the UK or impacting healthy spruce trees domestically."

            "text": "Using extensive pheromone trap networks across France, Belgium and England, scientists have managed to track the beetles\u2019 movements. They observed a clear pattern in the Ardenne region, where the number of beetles decrease the further you are away from outbreak hotspots. This confirms that cross-channel aerial dispersal is indeed a viable pathway for this pest invasion.3"

The combination of heavy rain and waterlogging throughout 2024, followed by the driest spring in 69 years, are considered to be key causes for putting lowland spruce on clay soils under significant stress."
