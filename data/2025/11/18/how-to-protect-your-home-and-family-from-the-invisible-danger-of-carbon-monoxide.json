            "text": "In England, 68% of carbon monoxide deaths occur in autumn and winter. During colder months, we use heating appliances more and keep windows closed to stay warm. This combination - more potentially malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances in use and less ventilation can create the perfect conditions for CO to build up to dangerous levels."

Install alarms in every room with a fuel-burning appliance \u2013 whether that's a gas boiler, coal fire, or wood-burning stove. The same applies to temporary accommodation such as caravans and boats.\u00a0Test your alarms regularly, and replace batteries as needed."

When cooking or using open fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, or other fuel-burning appliances, ensure you have adequate ventilation.
