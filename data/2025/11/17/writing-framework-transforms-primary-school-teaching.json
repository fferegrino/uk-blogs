It unites imagination, composition, transcription, and motor skills, demanding immense effort from pupils and equally, careful teaching that never compromises on the empowering and enjoyable aspects of writing."

Its principles affirm much of the research-informed practice in our classrooms while providing valuable tools for reflection."

            "text": "One of its most significant statements is that \u201cwriting must be taught separately from reading.\u201d Focused lessons in both subjects have been transformative. In reading lessons, children write about what they\u2019ve read, while in writing lessons we study rich mentor texts. Writing in response to books has value but belongs in the reading curriculum. If children only write in response to texts, they risk being confined to others\u2019 ideas. A genre-based writing approach, with support and freedom to choose own ideas, builds both confidence and competence."

As one teacher said: \u201cEvery piece of writing is as unique as the child who created it. I really get to know each child as a writer and person.\u201d"

Daily handwriting now continues through to Year 6, and spelling is taught in short, frequent bursts. Spelling in context is already improving \u2014 vital in a school where over 90% of pupils are EAL.For many schools, the Framework represents change. For us, it affirms and energises: a resource that helps balance explicit skill teaching with nurturing children\u2019s will. It reminds us that every child can take pleasure and pride in their writing."
