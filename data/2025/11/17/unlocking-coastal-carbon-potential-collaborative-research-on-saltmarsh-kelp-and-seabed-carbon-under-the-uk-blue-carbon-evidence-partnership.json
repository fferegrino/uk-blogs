Among the most promising \u2014 yet still poorly understood \u2014 are our coastal and marine ecosystems. Saltmarshes, seagrass meadows and other coastal marine habitats not only support biodiversity and protect our shorelines \u2014 they also act as natural carbon stores, capturing and locking away carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These \u201cblue carbon\u201d ecosystems play an important role in both tackling and adapting to climate change."

Yet, despite this policy progress, major data gaps remain. We still lack robust evidence to quantify how much carbon is stored in different coastal habitats \u2014 particularly seagrass, saltmarshes, and seabed sediments \u2014 and how these stores are changing under human and climate pressures. Filling these gaps is essential if we are to manage, protect, and restore blue carbon ecosystems effectively and ensure that policy is grounded in robust, place-based evidence."

Despite these benefits, saltmarshes in England have experienced significant decline, with up to 85% lost since the mid-19th century. Working with partners including the Environment Agency, Natural England and UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the UKBCEP is investigating the contribution of UK saltmarshes to climate change mitigation for inclusion in the UK's greenhouse gas inventory (a framework for monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions and storage). This work package aims to deliver UK-specific estimates of emissions from saltmarshes, enabling a more accurate assessment of progress towards the UK's net zero goals."

Six flux towers (four led by the Environment Agency, two led by Natural England) have been installed by UKCEH and have been collecting real time evidence on carbon dioxide as well as other site variables. \u00a0Initial results are promising and suggest that these saltmarshes are acting as overall net carbon sinks. Longer term funding of this network is key; evidence gathered over multiple years will aid comparison across different saltmarshes, help identify regional changes in climate over time and will provide a detailed assessment of the role of saltmarsh in achieving the UK\u2019s Net Zero targets.\u00a0"

This work could provide a blueprint for other countries seeking to accurately measure emissions from saltmarsh carbon sinks. Currently, only the United States and Australia include saltmarshes in their greenhouse gas inventories. It is hoped that results from the work will provide the evidence needed to unlock funding, which can be used to restore and create these important habitats."

Cefas is also investigating how carbon sequestration supports climate regulation as an ecosystem service, including the potential economic and societal costs if this service were degraded. For example, recent research estimates that damage to seabed carbon storage from human activities and climate change could cost the UK economy up to \u00a310 billion over 25 years through increased coastal erosion and loss of ecosystem services. A follow up paper\u00a0highlights the need for new accounting guidance and governance frameworks for managing carbon in shelf seas."
