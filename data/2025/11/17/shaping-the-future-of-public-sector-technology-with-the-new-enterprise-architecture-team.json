As the re-established Enterprise Architecture team in Government Digital Service (GDS), our purpose is clear - to help implement solid digital foundations that enable transformation across government. We\u2019re here to work with and through existing teams to unlock greater value, together.We want to start a conversation, to share our purpose and priorities, and to build an integral community of leading architects who will help shape the future of public sector services. Our plans are ambitious, but with the strength of the digital community behind us, we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver lasting impact."
