This is the stark reality of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a growing threat to both human and animal health. At the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), we are on the front lines of the UK\u2019s fight against AMR, and we are proud to play a key role in protecting the effectiveness of life-saving drugs."

The current plan spans 2024 to 2029 and outlines nine strategic outcomes supported by 30 specific commitments. APHA contributes directly to many of these, helping turn ambition into action."

            "text": "One of our core responsibilities is running a scanning surveillance programme interlinked with our diagnostic services. This allows us to detect and identify pathogens of clinical significance in livestock and wildlife and test the sensitivity of bacteria to commonly used antibiotics. By working closely with vets and farmers, we raise awareness of endemic diseases and promote better biosecurity and infection control. The result? More targeted interventions and more responsible use of antimicrobials."

            "text": "Salmonella is an important example of a bacterium that can develop resistance to antimicrobials. It is also a zoonotic threat, meaning it can spread between animals and humans, often through contaminated food. APHA leads national control programmes for Salmonella in livestock, advising farmers and policymakers on how to keep it off farms and out of our food. When critically resistant strains (strains which are resistant to critically important antimicrobials for human medicine) appear, we act fast to stop them from gaining a foothold in the UK."

From studying how resistant bacteria spread to testing the effectiveness of disinfectants and bacteriophages (viruses that target bacteria), our research is helping shape the future of AMR control. We also develop rapid detection and characterisation tools to identify AMR bacteria: tools that are designed to work across human, animal, and environmental health sectors in a true One Health approach."
