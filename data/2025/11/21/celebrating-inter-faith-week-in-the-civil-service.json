It's a responsibility I take very seriously, but it's also one that fills me with hope and purpose. Faith and belief \u2013 whether religious, spiritual, or secular \u2013 shape how many of us see the world, make decisions, and connect with one another.\u00a0"

Both groups encourage employees to better understand those who have a faith or belief, and those who have none. We have cross-CS faith and belief networks, and within these exist multiple denominations and view points. Having recently met with our faith and belief networks, I can attest to them being fantastic places for everyone to learn more. All networks are open to all civil servants, regardless of whether you have a faith or belief, or none.\u00a0"
