We gain this through our inspections of schools and further education and skills providers, and through our additional powers as the regulator of children\u2019s social care and early years. We describe what provision is available to children and learners, and how good it is, based on what we find on inspection. When we apply this understanding to a specific area of the country, we\u2019re able to describe what it is like to be a child growing up in that area using these services, including the challenges or opportunities that could come from living there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

We will start each inspection by talking with leaders about the context in which they are working. Ofsted: explore an area will support inspectors by equipping them with information on a provider\u2019s local area, leading to better, evidence-based conversations on inspections that consider that context. We have provided inspectors with more area-based information in their pre-inspection materials, drawing on the insights from Ofsted: explore an area.\u00a0"
