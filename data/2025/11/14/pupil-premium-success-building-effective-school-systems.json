Many families experience housing insecurity, financial instability, digital exclusion, and limited healthcare access. We support well above-average proportions of SEND and EAL learners, with a third of pupils entering below age-related expectations. Despite this, outcomes are consistently strong, with excellent destination data and disadvantaged pupils performing above FFT-20 benchmarks.\u00a0"
