These spacecraft will be our most capable yet, and the world\u2019s most advanced satellite IoT gateways, marking another milestone in a nine-year journey that began with a sketch and a belief that small devices on the ground could one day talk directly to satellites."

Inspired by Jack London\u2019s tales of frontier adventure, Wisdom of the Trail follows earlier missions such as Call of the Wild. They reflect our focus on discovery and perseverance: searching for signals in the world\u2019s most remote places - not for gold, but for data."

These \u201cwhispers from the wild\u201d allow farmers, environmental scientists, and utilities to monitor soil, water and infrastructure in areas far beyond the reach of mobile networks."
