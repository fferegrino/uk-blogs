Within an hour, I\u2019d walked him through our new Business Growth Service platform. He accessed tailored advice through his local Growth Hub, secured a grant, and started bidding for public contracts. Small intervention, big change, and exactly why this work matters."

That frustration, the runaround, the wasted hours was holding back too many businesses from growing. When small businesses thrive, communities prosper and living standards rise. But complexity was getting in the way."

Many businesses still don\u2019t know where to start and trust peer recommendations over official channels. Once they engage though, they\u2019re often surprised by how practical and personalised the support actually is."
