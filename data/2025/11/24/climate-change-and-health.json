Indeed, the Office for Health Improvement & Disparities have stated that climate change has been identified as \u201cthe most important health threat of the century\u201d. The health of the planet and the health of people are inextricably linked; clean air, safe water, and food security are fundamental determinants of wellbeing."

As the UK\u2019s climate warms, we are witnessing direct impacts on health such as heatwaves, floods, and new patterns of disease as well as indirect impacts mediated through ecosystems, infrastructure and the economy. In 2024 over 5 million potential labour hours (equivalent to \u00a377.9 million) were lost due to extreme heat and insurers paid out a record \u00a3585 million for weather-related damages."
