Bridging this gap became essential for UKEF to remain agile, secure, and productive in a rapidly moving and changing technology and cyber landscape."

This wasn\u2019t just a structural change\u2014it was a cultural shift. By employing civil servants and managing ITSM processes ourselves, we created a foundation for delivering a truly first-class employee experience with technology."

This change gave us greater control over service quality, improved responsiveness, and ensured that technology was aligned with UKEF\u2019s values and mission."
