Deer browsing alone can reduce timber values by up to 30-50%,1 and in extreme cases, it can stop the establishment of new woodlands altogether. Common mammal species that are known to damage trees include deer, grey squirrels, voles, rabbits, hares and domestic livestock."

But wild, domestic and feral mammals can all cause significant damage to trees, potentially impacting woodland creation and management goals. This may affect the valuable ecosystem services that trees provide, such as biodiversity conservation and timber production. "
