            "text": "This apparent choice can at first sight make sense, but the fact is that it\u2019s false, and a false choice that has for far too long held back progress."

        {
            "text": "The reality is that our economic success, public health and national resilience all depend on a thriving natural environment. From the clean water that powers our industries to the green spaces that keep our communities healthy, Nature isn't an obstacle to growth \u2013 it's the foundation that makes a liveable future possible."

        {
            "text": "This basic truth about the need to restore the health of the natural world in order that it can continue to support society is what drives our new strategy. It\u2019s called \u201cRecovering Nature for Growth, Health and Security\u201d and was launched last week. It sets out a systemic change in approach. This is because England\u2019s natural environment has continued to decline overall, despite current protections, and incremental site-by-site action has not generated the level of Nature recovery we need to see."
        },
        {
            "text": "Implementing this strategy means change in how Natural England works, and in how we work with partners across business, government and communities to integrate Nature into every day decision making. Nature is essential national infrastructure, underpinning economic growth, health, and security. Although it remains under great strain, there is hope for the future in much of the work now taking place."

        {
            "text": "Even in places where the natural world is particularly fragile, strong partnerships are enabling sensitive development to come forward in ways which allow Nature to recover. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen recently in the Arun Valley area in North Sussex where Natural England has worked with partners to enable more than 20,000 new homes to go ahead while protecting internationally important wetlands and creating new opportunities for Nature recovery."

            "text": "Across Britain, forward-thinking companies are discovering that working with Nature isn't just good for the environment \u2013 it's good for business. I frequently come across specific cases which prove this broad point, including at one of Britain\u2019s largest infrastructure projects."

I\u2019ve seen in Nottinghamshire how the aggregates company Tarmac is delivering Nature-positive outcomes at quarry sites while supplying the materials needed for new houses and major infrastructure. Anglian Water has embedded strong Nature-positive ambitions into plans for its new Fenland Reservoir. Across the farming sector, more producers are embracing Nature recovery as part of modern food production."

            "text": "The key to combining Nature and growth successfully lies in working at a strategic scale, bringing together multiple partners to find innovative solutions, and to do that during project conception, rather than retrofitting mitigations half way through. Natural England has pioneered this approach, and the results speak for themselves."
        },
        {
            "text": "Our strategic licencing system for great crested newts exemplifies this thinking. Rather than assessing each development site individually, we enable planners and developers to focus development in suitable areas while funding enhanced habitat for these protected amphibians elsewhere. The result? A faster planning process and larger, healthier newt populations overall."
        },

            "text": "This partnership approach proved transformative in delivering over 50,000 homes around the Thames Basin Heaths. When the area was designated as a Special Protection Area for ground-nesting birds in 2005, housing plans initially stalled due to concerns about increased recreational pressure. But Natural England worked closely with 11 local authorities and developers to create alternative green spaces for residents. The outcome exceeded everyone's expectations: homes were built ahead of schedule, almost 2,000 hectares of new recreational space was created, and populations of Dartford warbler, woodlark and nightjar increased."

            "text": "Today's legislative landscape actively encourages businesses to integrate Nature into development plans. The commitment to halt biodiversity decline by 2030 provides clear direction, while policies like Biodiversity Net Gain ensure new developments leave a Nature-positive legacy. In many cases, this results in higher quality natural environments than existed before development began."

Within the next decade, we could see housing developments that incorporate functional ecosystems, making homes more resilient to climate impacts and more attractive places to live. Infrastructure could work with natural processes rather than against them, reducing long-term maintenance costs while improving performance."

The path ahead is clear. It invites us to collaborate and build the partnerships necessary for achieving the resilient, prosperous and secure nation that can come from integrated the goals of growth and Nature recovery, rather than relying on the kinds of outdated thinking that pit development against the health of our natural environment."
