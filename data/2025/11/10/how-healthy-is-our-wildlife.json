It provides a comprehensive overview into the fascinating world of wildlife disease surveillance activities in 2024 across England, Wales and Scotland, offering insights for scientists, conservationists, and curious nature lovers alike, interested in the health of our native and non-native wildlife species."

            "text": "Infectious and non-infectious disease surveillance of wild mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles in GB is mainly achieved by post-mortem examination and diagnostic testing of dead wild animals. This is known as scanning surveillance. Carcases are submitted to the APHA Diseases of Wildlife Scheme (DoWS) via veterinary investigation centres and surveillance pathology partners, SRUC, and other GBWHP partners with pathology facilities. This ensures that we have pathology expertise across a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic wildlife species."

The Garden Wildlife Health project investigates reports of sick and dead garden birds, amphibians, reptiles, and hedgehogs - those familiar faces of British back gardens. Meanwhile, the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme dives into the mysteries behind the deaths of marine giants like dolphins, porpoises, whales, as well as seals, basking sharks, and sea turtles found along our shores."

This is the proactive sampling of species aimed at detecting a particular disease or pathogen - an essential step for early intervention and effective disease control. Sections in this year\u2019s report showcase the wide range of scanning and targeted surveillance activities conducted by partners over the last year. The impact of diseases on wildlife populations, with the wider implications for humans and domestic animals are also explained. Understanding these connections is key to building a resilient, One Health approach to disease management."

For species of conservation concern, a mass fatality may further threaten an already vulnerable or declining population. An example where disease surveillance is playing a key role in monitoring this kind of threat, described in the report, is in the detection of squirrel pox disease, spread by grey squirrels, which can threaten geographically isolated red squirrel populations with extinction. \u00a0"

The crayfish were found to have unusual shell deformities and Cefas provided a rapid response, collecting samples from dead crayfish at different sites for diagnostic testing."
