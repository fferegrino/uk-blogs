We\u2019ve always prided ourselves on having a strong and supportive community - something that comes up regularly in staff surveys and exit interviews. So, we set to work on how to improve this."

There\u2019s been lots of change over the past year, and this felt like something positive and within our control. We did some research with different disciplines across digital who had done something similar, to explore what worked well and any lessons learned."

Our community is large and based across England and Wales, so we wanted the group to be representative of regions. We looked at both virtual and in-person events and optimising existing meet-ups."

We also committed to collecting feedback and researching what kinds of events would best support wellbeing."

At our first event, we ran a short \u2018similarities\u2019 icebreaker, where small teams raced to find things that had in common, to promote sharing and connection. This was followed by speed networking after lunch. There was a real sense of connection and fun, and feedback from the day showed a real enthusiasm and gratitude for the opportunity to get to know colleagues more face to face, and calling for similar sessions in the future. We gathered anonymous feedback, as we do with all away days. The response was overwhelmingly positive and clearly met the objectives we set. People enjoyed getting to know each other in an informal way and this helped to feel a part of the community."

We ran a teambuilding event where participants were split into small groups and given a series of creative and competitive challenges to complete. We designed each activity to encourage collaboration and quick thinking while \u00a0strengthening teamwork and building our sense of community."

            "text": "With colleagues based across the UK and a mix of office and home working, we knew virtual events were just as important. While some regular, ongoing sessions had low attendance, we found that seasonal or themed events worked better as it was easier for people\u00a0to make time for them. These had higher engagement and more positive feedback, so we shifted our approach to more tailored events."

We\u2019d achieved our aim of helping people get to know each other and building a kind, caring community. Many people said they\u2019d made genuine friendships and felt a stronger sense of belonging. The People Survey results also show more people in the community want to stay in the organisation, and fewer want to leave quickly."
