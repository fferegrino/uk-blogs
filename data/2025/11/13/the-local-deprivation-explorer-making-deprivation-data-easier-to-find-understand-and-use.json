This approach allows us to avoid common pitfalls with large data-driven apps, such as slow calls to servers, heavy client-side number crunching (for example, based on the user's inputted postcode) and dynamic content which is difficult to index. The SEO benefits mean this content gets higher visibility in Google searches, helping more users get to the insights more quickly.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0Built-in reactivity:\u202fSvelte allows us to easily manage users' selections \u2013 it helps us serve personalised and localised content without repeatedly asking for selections, or without needing to write lots of complex code to save and track those selections.\u00a0"
