These anniversaries offer a moment to reflect on how far we've come in opening up the landscape for everyone to enjoy, and remind us that these rights shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted."

            "text": "Enacted on 30 November 2000, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was a transformative piece of legislation. \u00a0Before the Act, access other than on public rights of way was limited and often contested. \u00a0The CROW Act changed that by giving the public a legal right of access to designated areas of land (mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land) for open-air recreation. \u00a0It was the result of decades of campaigning, starting with the mass trespass at Kinder Scout in 1932, by people who believed that the beauty of the countryside should be shared by all.\u00a0 In England and Wales there are approximately 1.3 million hectares of access land."

As it nears completion, it will offer a continuous walking route around the entire English coastline, opening up new vistas and opportunities for exploration."

These forests had an estimated 313 million visits last year. Forestry England are now working to create new woodlands, adding 859ha freehold land since 2021, with funding from Defra\u2019s Nature for Climate Fund. These will become open access once the trees are established and Forestry England has ambitions to continue creating open access woodlands, adding around 1000ha of new freehold woodland per year over the next few years."

Open Access has played a vital role here, in opening up so many new areas of land for everyone to explore, and in relieving the pressure on highly-visited hot spots by offering a much wider choice of places in which to \u201cget off the beaten track\u201d and enjoy the outdoors"

The Duty of Regard was updated by Section 245 of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, requiring authorities to actively \u2018seek to further\u2019 the statutory purposes of Protected Landscapes - making conservation a core part of relevant authorities decision-making."
