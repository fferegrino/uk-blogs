With a genuinely plan-led framework, getting a plan ready for examination from local planning authorities takes time, effort and community. This is a long and careful process - once the plan comes to us at the Planning Inspectorate, we \u00a0aim to run examinations as quickly and efficiently as possible."

To help with this, we recently held programme officer training, attended by 11 people, for soon to be and existing programme officers alike."

Attendees wishing to get training come from various backgrounds ,\u00a0 with a wide range of experience including project management and working in various roles in local authorities. \u00a0Everyone\u2019s unique background brings transferable skills, like communication and process management."

A job that sits in the heart of different areas of planning roles, it\u2019s rewarding, flexible and a fascinating way to see the planning process in action from all perspectives. \u00a0If you are interested in programme officer training, contact: plans.admin@planninginspectorate.gov.uk \u00a0for more details."
