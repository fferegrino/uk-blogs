Obviously, a service like NUAR needs to consider potential impacts to\u00a0digital and\u00a0physical infrastructure, and we\u2019ve worked very closely with the relevant agencies to ensure a strong security posture across cyber, physical and personnel threats.\u00a0"

We have taken a deliberately\u00a0very cautious\u00a0approach to publishing NUAR code and artefacts, as fully open-source code would inevitably expose elements of the system security controls, and the methods employed to protect sensitive data. Providing hostile actors with a greater understanding of these measures could make them easier to circumvent.\u00a0"

We have fully adopted the standard user interface components used for GOV.UK services, we\u2019ve had a particular focus on the use of open-source software to reduce the impact of vendor lock-in, and most notably we have built NUAR upon a harmonised data model which is based on\u00a0international open standards, and which is itself\u00a0open-sourced. In fact, NUAR is the first implementation internationally of the OGC MUDDI\u00a0Conceptual\u00a0Data Model and has contributed significantly to the development of that standard.\u00a0"

This\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0just about\u00a0opening\u00a0up\u00a0source code either, but also include principles,\u00a0specifications\u00a0and other useful material.\u00a0"
