To make the test experience more reflective of the current everyday conditions motorists face, and to better prepare learners for a lifetime of safe driving.\u00a0\u00a0"

The extension of independent driving has also given learners more time to demonstrate their ability to follow directions independently, just like they would after passing their test.\u00a0\u00a0"
