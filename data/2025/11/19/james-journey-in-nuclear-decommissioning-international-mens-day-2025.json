This external perspective was invaluable early on, helping me appreciate the broader reach of our sector and understand that our work extends far beyond the boundaries of our immediate group."

I\u2019ve seen this first-hand through a recent secondment with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), where I gained insight into how our work supports and is supported by wider departmental priorities. I also had the opportunity to contribute to shaping a range of policies across my area of radioactive waste, spent fuels and nuclear materials. Whilst I remained working in a familiar policy area, applying that knowledge outside the NDA group in support of wider government objectives, at the time focussed on the development of Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) policy as well as new developing new enrichment capability (High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium or HALEU). This really helped me appreciate the world beyond the NDA group, but also reinforced the fundamental role we place in supporting the entire sector."

This work, aims to make sure that all the UKs nuclear liabilities are managed as efficiently and effectively as possible to deliver the best outcomes for the industry and value for money for the taxpayer."

Whether it\u2019s booking a CrossFit class that makes me log off at an appropriate time, or escaping out onto the fells or Pennines with my two cocker spaniels, Monty and Bertie, or even more foolishly, renovating a Grade II listed house (a very lengthy pet project indeed), I know the importance of separating the two strands of my life and prioritising balance. If I\u2019m not looking after myself outside of work, I\u2019m no good when I\u2019m in work, and vice versa."
