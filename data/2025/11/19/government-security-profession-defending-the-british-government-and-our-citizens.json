So it is critical that we continue to build and evolve the capability of our security teams to meet them. That means continuously improving and adjusting our skills across physical, personnel, technical and cyber security. With that challenge comes a whole world of opportunities to grow and develop as a security professional."

Leadership is multi-faceted, and I always thought I couldn\u2019t be a leader as I am not necessarily creative or innovative (unless it\u2019s to do with sewing). My advice is that it\u2019s OK to still be learning and growing; you don\u2019t have to be the perfect leader before you take on a leadership role."
