Without urgent action, routine illnesses could become deadly, reversing decades of clinical progress and endangering global health security.\u00a0 The health of humans, animals, and the environment is interconnected, a concept known as the One Health approach. In marine ecosystems, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat, driven by pollution, wastewater discharge, and inappropriate antibiotic use of antimicrobials in human, animals and environment sectors. Resistant bacteria can spread through the water, affecting marine life and ultimately posing risks to human health."

Alumni experiences from the Fleming Fund Fellowship were shared and theoretical AST sessions led by Cefas, and APHA also took place. Additionally, the collaborators had the opportunity to attend an e-learning course on residues with theoretical and online sessions through August to October 2025 and online training on InFarm by the FAO team in October 2025."

The event brought together participants from 11 countries across South and Southeast Asia. Through a combination of theoretical sessions and practical, hands-on laboratory training, attendees gained valuable skills in detecting AMR in aquatic animals. Find out more in our workshop blog."

            "text": "Bacteria that infect animals including fish, play an important role in the global spread of AMR, and need to be considered alongside important human pathogens to fully understand and tackle drug resistance. Cefas, as the UK FAO AMR Reference Centre, has led global initiatives to establish ECOFFs (ecological cut off values) for aquatic pathogens, coordinating multi-laboratory studies across three continents. Using various AMR tests under varied conditions -\u00a0 including different temperatures - the team determined antibiotic resistance thresholds for pathogens like Yersinia ruckeri and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. These cut-off values are critical for identifying resistant strains, guiding treatment strategies, and protecting aquatic and human health against the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. The work underpinning these efforts was recently highlighted as an important case study for the UK\u2019s national action plan (NAP)."

Funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care, AMROH supports Fleming Fund Country Grants by strengthening AMR surveillance across animal health including aquaculture and environment sectors. There are several AMROH grants targeted at Lower- and middle-Income Countries (LMICs) regions e.g. West Africa, East Africa, South and South East Asia. The grant the Reference Centre leads targets four West African countries\u2014Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Recent milestones include workshops on antimicrobial residues in Ghana, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) training in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal, and the feedback on the surveillance strategies in all four recipient countries.

This research contributes to a baseline screening of the presence of AMR in the Gulf marine environment and will inform the ongoing development of Kuwait\u2019s agri-environment surveillance programme and national guidelines on antibiotic usage.
