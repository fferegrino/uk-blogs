            "text": "Avian influenza (bird flu) is an infectious disease that affects birds, caused by the influenza A virus. Birds are the hosts for a variety of influenza A virus subtypes, particularly waterfowl and shore birds. All birds are susceptible to avian influenza A and the virus can rapidly cause significant mortality in flocks but some species of bird show more severe clinical signs than others."
        },
        {
            "text": "The influenza A viruses found in birds are not well adapted to infect humans, and human infections with avian influenza viruses are rare. However, some subtypes, such as A(H5N1) or A(H7N9), have been associated with human disease, usually in people directly exposed to infected birds or animals."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over the past few years, a particular virus has come to dominate infections in birds internationally; influenza A(H5N1). Globally it has also caused animal outbreaks among mink and marine mammals and has now spread among dairy cows in the United States. There have been a number of human cases in those working on farms with affected cattle in the US. Both A(H5N1) and A(H5N5) were detected in wild and kept birds in Great Britain last year. \u00a0There are many different types of influenza A(H5N1) and the genotype in the UK is different from that circulating in the US."

            "text": "The symptoms of avian influenza in humans vary. Most of the infections in humans that have occurred in the US have been mild, with symptoms of conjunctivitis (red, sore and discharging eyes) being common. However, the infection can be serious, and a number of individuals in the US and beyond - for instance in Cambodia - have experienced severe illness."
        },
        {
            "text": "Almost all cases of A(H5N1) virus infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds and mammals or contaminated environments. Influenza A(H5N1) continues to infect new mammal hosts (ranging from foxes, otters and seals to cattle), increasing the opportunities the virus has to evolve."
        },
        {
            "text": "The concern is that the virus may at some point evolve further, allowing it to adapt better to infecting people and spreading between them. We therefore remain vigilant for any evidence of changing levels of risk and keep this under constant review, although based on the latest evidence the current risk to the UK human population from avian influenza remains very low."

Avian influenza is not often found in small garden birds."
