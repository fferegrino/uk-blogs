It marks the start of a 12-month transition period, giving your company time to make sure all directors and people with significant control (PSCs) have verified their identity by their due dates. Any new director will need to verify their identity to incorporate a company or be appointed to an existing company."

From 18 November, directors will need to provide their personal code as part of their company\u2019s annual confirmation statement. Verifying early gives you plenty of time to get everything in order and avoid any last-minute stress. It also means that if an agent or accountant usually files on your company\u2019s behalf, there\u2019s time to share your code with them before it\u2019s needed."
