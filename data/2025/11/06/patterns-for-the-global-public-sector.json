The point itself was the pattern, passed from maker to maker. Ancient Egypt used cubit rods\u2014state-issued measuring sticks that ensured everyone worked to the same standard. Medieval guilds transmitted design knowledge through apprenticeships, guaranteeing quality and protecting craft reputations. Edo Japan's printed kimono catalogues enabled ordinary customers to browse designs and commission garments, scaling choice while allowing for local adaptation."

Britain established the Government School of Design (which became the Royal College of Art) to teach artisans how to apply patterns to ceramics and textiles. This was an industrial strategy\u2014patterns as statecraft to make British goods competitive."

Our goal was to identify emerging patterns across different governments and explore opportunities for international collaboration in developing and sharing them."

            "text": "A key insight emerged: design patterns in government operate at multiple levels simultaneously. They exist as nested hierarchies - from micro-level digital interactions to macro-level life event journeys that span multiple agencies. Patterns function as containers within containers, offering reusable solutions that can scale from individual user actions to systemic reforms."
