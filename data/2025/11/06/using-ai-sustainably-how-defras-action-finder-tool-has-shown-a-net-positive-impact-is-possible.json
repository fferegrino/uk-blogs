At Defra, we recently set out to test a bold hypothesis: can AI deliver a net positive impact \u2013 environmentally, socially, and economically, while also solving a real-world problem?"

The Defra team comprised Rhiannon Long (Senior Content Designer), Giorgio Peacock (Product Manager) and Lee Croucher (Lead Product Manager), working alongside a team of data scientists and sustainability experts at Transform UK. We started by looking for a real use case with the potential to make a big impact for our users. We found it in the farming funding experience."

        {
            "text": "Farmers across England rely on Defra schemes to support more sustainable and profitable agriculture. But finding the right funding, understanding eligibility and navigating regulations is far from simple. Complex GOV.UK content, limited information around compatibility between schemes and a lack of personalised support often push farmers to incur costs by using land agents or to have long phone calls with our contact centre. This increases costs, causes delays and contributes to unnecessary carbon emissions. It also creates a high barrier to entry, with many farmers potentially missing out on funding they could be receiving."

The LLMs used were quite experimental, meaning it would provide slightly different options when you input the same query twice."
