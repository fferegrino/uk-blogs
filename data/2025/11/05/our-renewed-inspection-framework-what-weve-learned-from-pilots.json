Many providers described the toolkit and methodology as a positive step forward, appreciating the clarity they bring to the inspection process and the opportunity to see how inspectors are applying the renewed approach. The collaborative tone, regular reflection meetings, learning walks with headteachers, and the move away from deep dives are all being well received.\u00a0"

This could be, for example, where there is a very small cohort.

In smaller schools \u2013 including some primaries \u2013 or those with more complex contexts, logistics often needed extra thought. For example, we\u2019ve seen how important it is to anticipate the potential impact on staff right from the planning call. Involving leaders in shaping the timetable, deciding who is best placed to accompany inspectors, and planning how case sampling and learning walks will work can help keep things calm and avoid overwhelming staff.\u00a0"
