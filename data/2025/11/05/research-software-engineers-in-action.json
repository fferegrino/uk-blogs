Research\u00a0Software\u00a0Engineers work in all parts of government; from the Met Office helping you be weather ready to the home of big data and artificial intelligence,\u00a0The Alan Turing Institute. Research software engineering covers a wide range of roles in the civil service. If you work with software in\u00a0research,\u00a0you might also be a research software engineer.\u00a0"

RSEs from\u00a0seven\u00a0government departments gave 11 talks and workshops on a wide range of topics from the energy efficiency of supercomputers to climate communication. This year there were four government sponsors: The Met Office, AWE\u2019s strategic Centre of Excellence in Scientific Computing based at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), and\u00a0The Alan Turing Institute.\u00a0Sponsoring such events gives us the chance\u00a0to\u00a0promote public service and government research while fostering new connections with industry and academia.\u00a0"
