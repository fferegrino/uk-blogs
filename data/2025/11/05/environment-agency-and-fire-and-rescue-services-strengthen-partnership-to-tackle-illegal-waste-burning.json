We both sit on the county Environmental Crime Partnership and jointly proposed the establishment of a multi-agency project team focused on deliberate waste fires making this a county-wide priority for the year. Together, we co-lead the project, working alongside local authorities, the police, and the National Farmers Union (NFU) County Advisor."

By categorising incidents by cause, we were able to identify fires that were deliberately ignited by waste operators seeking to avoid environmental regulation and disposal costs, \u00a0with clear disregard for the environment and public health."

The involvement of the NFU facilitates two-way information exchange with stakeholders directly affected by, and influential in addressing these issues.

We have worked together not only on waste-related incidents but also during tidal and fluvial flooding, emergency planning exercises, Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) events, and major incidents such as the Buncefield oil terminal fire in 2005. These partnerships demonstrate our shared commitment to protecting people, businesses and the environment."
