Emily's story is a powerful example of what dedicated support can achieve. Her life was transformed by Staying Close, a Department for Education-funded programme supporting care leavers. The Children\u2019s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which is currently going through parliament, will strengthen duties on councils to provide support like Staying Close."

I came into care when I was 2 and lived in a mixture of foster care, with family, and in residential homes. When I was 17, my social worker told me about Staying Close. To be honest, I didn't want the service, but I agreed to meet my Personal Staying Close Adviser, Cath. I'm so glad I did."

One house I stayed at regularly had chaos, random people coming and going with substance misuse. I was either coming back at all hours or staying out, and I was close to being asked to leave my residential home."

I'd tell other young people: take all the advice and support because it's genuine. Everyone on Staying Close really cares. When they tell you something, they mean it. You can trust them.Everyone on the team tells me how it is in a nice way, and I really respect this. They don't just help me, they help my baby and my baby's dad too. They look after us like their own family. There aren't enough words in the world to say thank you."
