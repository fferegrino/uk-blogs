Local schemes are often brilliant at inspiring participation and in keeping people engaged year after year, but they may lack scientific rigor or pathways to wider impact. "

In cases where existing methods were designed for national rather than local data needs, they were adapted to make them relevant at a local scale. Volunteers recruited through local networks were then trained in these methods, and were able to start carrying out surveys of water quality to Environment Agency accepted standards. Meanwhile, wider Rivers Trust facilities made it possible for local data to be immediately available to the volunteers and the project, and grouped it together with similar data produced by other initiatives.\u202f"
