When Baum began publishing the Oz books, the copyright law in effect in the United States (US) was the Copyright Act of 1831, which provided a 28-year term with a possible fourteen more years upon renewal. "

        {
            "text": "However, the Copyright Act of 1909 retroactively affected Baum's books, allowing a 28-year renewal for 56 total years of copyright protection. The L. Frank Baum Trust renewed the copyright on all of Baum's Oz novels, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz entered the public domain in 1956 when the copyright expired in the US.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Although the beloved children\u2019s novel was written in the US, its copyright would have been protected in the UK through international agreements such as the Berne Convention. Dating back to 1886, the Berne Convention is an international copyright treaty that enables creators\u2014including authors, poets, painters and musicians\u2014to control the use of their work across more than 180 signatory nations.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "In the UK, copyright in 1900 was covered by the Copyright Act of 1842, which provided protection for life of the author plus 7 years, or 42 years from publication. The Copyright Act of 1911 extended this to life of the author plus 50 years. This would have protected The Wonderful Wizard of Oz until 1969, but because the US had a shorter term, copyright would also have expired in the UK in 1956. This means anyone can lawfully use Baum's original story, characters and ideas without asking permission or paying fees.\u00a0"

This was later adapted into a Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman that's still running today. In 2024, the first act of the musical was released as the movie Wicked. And now? We're getting a sequel, with Wicked: For Good telling the story of act two. "

In the UK, copyright protection usually lasts for 70 years after the creator's death. The last of the relevant authors of the film died in 1987 (producer Mervyn LeRoy), meaning that the 1939 film's copyright is still very much active until 2057.\u00a0"
