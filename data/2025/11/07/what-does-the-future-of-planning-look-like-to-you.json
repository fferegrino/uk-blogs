The planning profession can be seen negatively in the public gaze, and we can help influence this perception through education. Greater interaction is needed with education establishments to promote the career for students interested in human geography and environmental/ social issues. Innovative pathways such as apprenticeships should be fully explored to widen access to planning careers and to ensure that the workforce truly reflects our diverse communities.\""

Since then, I've developed a real appreciation for how planning impacts everyday lives - from communities to infrastructure. Looking ahead, I'd like to continue leveraging my skills and confidence as a case officer, gaining deeper technical knowledge and contributing to projects that use innovation, like AI in an ethical way - this would help streamline the repetitive processes, improve data analysis and free up time for planners to focus more on decision making. For me, the goal is to keep developing while helping make the planning process more transparent, efficient, and accessible for everyone Involved.\"\u00a0"

Looking ahead, I hope we use this moment of huge pressure to rethink how planning processes work: to make them more responsive, inclusive, and able to meet today\u2019s challenges.\""
