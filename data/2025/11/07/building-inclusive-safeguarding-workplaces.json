Yet here we are\u2014two sold-out conferences later and a community that continues to prove belonging in the workplace isn\u2019t just \u201cnice to have,\u201d it\u2019s essential."

With support from Isabelle Trowler, George the Poet, and others, the conference created what we\u2019d all been waiting for: a safe space where we could speak honestly about our experiences without fear of being silenced or dismissed."

Some colleagues travelled from Scotland, Manchester, and Sunderland to this West Midlands event, while local authorities invested by buying tickets for their staff. More than 40 Black-owned businesses filled our exhibitor stands since 2024, creating a powerful bridge between social care and business. We were proud to have Nala\u2019s Baby support us by donating products for children entering care\u2014highlighting a real gap in provision for global majority children. Over 40 speakers delivered workshops, keynotes, and panel discussions in a packed learning programme."

            "text": "Why did I create this space? Because I\u2019ve lived it. I know what it feels like to face microaggressions and racism in the workplace, to feel unseen despite giving your all. In my coaching practice, I noticed the same painful themes resurfacing: racial trauma, exclusion, and the exhaustion of fighting to be heard. One-to-one support wasn\u2019t enough. We needed a community. A national voice. A movement.BDSC demonstrated this power. Global majority managers and anti-racist group leaders spoke candidly about workplace trauma and resilience, creating a ripple of honesty that gave others permission to share. Our workshops reminded us that lasting change in frontline practice requires collective effort and the courage to challenge systems head-on. Wellbeing wasn\u2019t forgotten: from massages to skincare, we made self-care part of the agenda."
