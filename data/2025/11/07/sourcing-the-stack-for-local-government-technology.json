A recent study by the Ministry for Housing, Communities, and Local Government (MHCLG) on building understanding of software markets in local government confirmed that the technology landscape in this area is dominated by a handful of suppliers in key areas."

            "text": "Added to this, there\u2019s a systemic contradiction that local government is fragmented by design, but given the state of the market, councils often make similar technology choices, then individually procure many of the same products from a small pool of vendors, and separately expend the time of their under-resourced teams managing their own local technology stack of those similar products."
