Yet they have long been understudied, especially in urban areas. It\u2019s a lack of data which presents a challenge, especially at a time when public and government attention is focused on our freshwater environments. "

The result has been three innovative initiatives \u2013 GenePools, the\u00a0Priority Ponds Project, and the Urban Pond Count \u2013 which have placed the power of freshwater research directly into the hands of the public. By testing new technologies and accessible methods, these projects are providing new ways for non-experts to meaningfully contribute to large-scale environmental data collection."

To explore the biodiversity of urban ponds using environmental DNA (eDNA) testing. eDNA sampling allows scientists to detect and classify species based on the genetic material they shed into the environment. While it\u2019s still a relatively recent addition to the ecological toolkit, it has the potential to become a foundational one, with uses and methods currently being explored across Natural England and beyond."

But with more than 80% of the UK population living in urban areas, they\u2019re ideal for a citizen science approach. The Natural History Museum, which led engagement for GenePools, invited volunteers from six cities to collect water samples for analysis, recruiting participants from pre-schoolers to retirees. Their collective efforts resulted in the sampling of over 750 ponds and the identification of thousands of species: insect DNA appeared in 98% of ponds, frog DNA in 53%, and mammal DNA in 50% \u2013 including one weasel in a pond in Bristol!"

At a larger scale, meanwhile, over 70,000 records are in the process of being added to the National Biodiversity Network Atlas \u00a0\u2013 some of the first DNA-based records to enter the UK\u2019s largest open-access collection of biodiversity information. Further research into the results by our partners Cefas is ongoing. "

For example, by aligning the methods used with the England Ecosystem Survey, which is undertaking professional pond eDNA surveys in rural areas across the country, we\u2019ve been able to ensure that the GenePools data can become part of a national picture,\u00a0 feeding into initiatives like the new pond health metric which is currently in development."

They estimate that the algorithm identifies 97% of non-priority ponds and 58% of priority ponds; while it isn\u2019t perfect, this initial filtering will make it much easier for specialists to focus their efforts on ponds which are likely to fit the priority pond criteria."
