My answer is that GenAI bots are not the risk in themselves. Instead, they\u2019re just another channel that gets Department for Business and Trade (DBT) information to wider audiences. We should focus less on a user's GenAI bot intelligence and more on improving DBT's content quality, which we have direct influence over."
