In most cases, evidence that the applicant has tried to communicate with the restrictioner on multiple occasions is not sufficient.If the application is accepted, the registrar will make an order disapplying the restriction to allow registration of the later disposition. The disapplication does not remove the restriction from the register.Additionally, if the restriction was never intended to catch a certain type of disposition, then disapplication would not be appropriate as it would relate only to the current transaction, not all future ones, so the replacement route, or more rarely, modification, should be used."
