This hugely impressive timber-framed, net-zero facility is the largest and most advanced in the UK. It can process up to four tonnes of tree seeds each year, with climate-controlled storage that preserves seeds for up to 20 years. This facility will significantly expand our ability to grow climate-resilient tree species that can thrive in hotter, drier conditions. I have also been able to visit woodland creation sites across the country over the last year, seeing first-hand the tremendous effort and progress being made on the ground.\u00a0\u00a0"
