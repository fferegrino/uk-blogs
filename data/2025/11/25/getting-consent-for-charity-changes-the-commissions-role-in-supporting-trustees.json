In March, we gave authority to the trustees of the Sir Percival David Foundation to amend their governing document, enabling them to donate the collection assembled by Sir Percival David across Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and China before his death in 1964."

By transferring the costs of maintaining the collection to the museum, the trustees were able to manage the charity\u2019s resources effectively and ensure that examples of the finest Chinese craftsmanship could remain on public view, in line with their founder\u2019s wishes."

Our latest quarterly data shows that across July to September 2025 we considered 1,667 applications and granted 747 permissions. Adding the 734 granted in the previous quarter, that's almost 1,500 so far this year \u2013 averaging almost 57 separate permissions granted per week. Each enables trustees of charities, large and small, to take both routine actions and highly significant steps."

Sometimes we need to provide trustees with advice or ask them for further information to help us decide whether we can give the authority. Some consents can be given with minimal engagement with the trustees, whilst others involve months of detailed work with trustees and multiple stakeholders to achieve complex outcomes."

In August this year we removed the names of trustees from several refugee charities after a far-right influencer named these charities in a YouTube broadcast, leaving trustees feeling unsafe and at risk of personal danger."

This important tourist destination with UNESCO World Heritage status, run by Ironbridge Museum Trust, has seen fewer visitors since the pandemic. The high cost of running 10 museums and caring for 35 listed buildings put the charity into financial difficulty. Consequently, the trustees concluded that the best long-term solution for financial stability would be for the charity to transfer its museums and property to the care of the National Trust, a much larger organisation with similar charitable purposes."

But where this is not the case, we are unable to work at the same pace. This underlines how important it is that when trustees are planning to make changes that require our authority, they come to us in good time so we can do all the necessary work to consider their applications and provide our decisions in line with any deadlines they may have."
