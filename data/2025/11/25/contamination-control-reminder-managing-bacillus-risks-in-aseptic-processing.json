While no firm link has been identified between these reports, previous instances have been linked to inadequate sanitisation of raw materials and consumables used in the manufacturing procedures."

Holders of manufacturing licenses must report defective medicines to the DMRC. Instances where contamination by Bacillus spp.\u00a0 including morphologically similar microorganisms, is identified or suspected in Grade A or B environments, will be used \u00a0to support national trend analysis and root cause investigations. Sites operating under Section 10 Exemption must also notify their SPS or National QA teams if Bacillus is recovered in Grade A or Grade B environments. These notifications will also feed into the investigations."
