As teenage sweethearts, they sought refuge in Warsaw when the war broke out, but soon returned to Sochaczew, joining other young people fleeing towards Russia. Along the way, they married in Bialystok, only to be arrested by Soviet forces and sent to a labour camp in the freezing Siberian city of Magnitogorsk."

            "text": "In the labour camp, my grandparents endured years of hardship, including slave labour, brutal conditions, and the personal tragedy of losing their first child, Batsheva. Despite these challenges, they persevered. Liberation finally came in 1945, however, unable to return to their homes in Poland, they lived as refugees in internment camps in Austria until the State of Israel was established in 1948. You can read more about my family history here."

Indeed, through connecting with the memory of the suffering that my family endured during the Holocaust, I am reminded of my duties \u2013 both as a granddaughter and a Civil Servant. My grandparents spoke so little of their story that I am in awe of its fragility; how it could easily have been forgotten and remained untold."
