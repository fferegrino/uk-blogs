Our key concerns revolve around whether incentives accidentally influence participants, compromise data quality, or are too generous.  Our approach is grounded in research ethics principles: respect for autonomy, individual beneficence, and justice. These principles help us balance participants\u2019 consent and research integrity, maximising benefits and minimising potential harm. \u00a0\u00a0"

For example, one of our projects involved creative arts students and SME businesses. In this project, the students partnered with businesses and collected data that enabled them to analyse business activities. The resulting outcome was students gaining an in-depth understanding of how businesses operate, and for business owners to gain a better understanding of their own businesses and reflect on their practices. This transformed the experience for both parties into a meaningful exercise rather than a mere function of data collection. "

Research is said to be a reflective process which involves both researchers and participants. Questions asked and the overall conversation during sessions can lead to shared knowledge and new ideas. In this sense, the process and its outcome, when explained in advance, could provide a form of incentives for participants to contribute to our projects."

For instance, in one of our research projects, participants were asked to find answers to questions related to their business on our website business.gov.uk. It signposted the users to further support services and networks. Many of our users shared that they were unaware of some listed services."

            "text": "Participating in our research projects also gives the participants a platform to advocate for their sector and have their voice heard, and this could also serve as an incentive for business community to share their experience with us. When we share our findings in DBT, direct quotes are often described as powerful, informative, and influential. Sharing these insights with the wider business community can foster a sense of altruism. Participation in research helps the community of the sector involved, enables the collective work of contributing to shaping public policy through expertise and opinion, and creates shared benefits. In this way, the process and outcomes of research can themselves serve as meaningful incentives."

Therefore, we embed non-monetary incentives in our practise by incorporating them in the research information sheet (the document that details research aims, processes and steps) for participants, promoting them in playbacks and sharing research findings with them. As a result, we maintain the 3 principles that guide research incentives: participants\u2019 autonomy, individual beneficence, and fairness. "
