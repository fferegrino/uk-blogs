We want to understand what factors might impact childhood in the future, how these issues impact each other, what different versions of the future could look like, and create positive visions for the future of childhood."

            "text": "In our first session in November, we discussed what childhood means to them, and the biggest factors they think will shape childhood in the UK over the next 10-20 years. They told us they view childhood as a time of innocence and fun, valuing education, parental support and freedom from responsibilities. They identified many drivers of change for the future, from AI to changes in education and relationships, to inequalities and social media. In the December session, we explored how these drivers might impact childhood in the future, focusing on areas of uncertainty. For example, for AI they imagine potential positive impacts (e.g. for learning), but also negative ones, worrying about its impact on jobs, skills, creativity and social connection. Their insights will help shape the scenarios we\u2019re developing to demonstrate the range of possible futures. We\u2019re grateful for their input and looking forward to working with them on other parts of the project over the next year."
