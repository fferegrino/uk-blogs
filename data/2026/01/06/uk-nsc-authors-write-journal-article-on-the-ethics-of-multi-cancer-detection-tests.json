            "text": "MCDs can look for signs of several different cancers at once, most commonly using a blood sample. This new approach could change how we screen for cancer, as current UK screening programmes only check for one type of cancer at a time, such as breast or bowel cancer. However, introducing MCD testing raises important ethical questions."

        {
            "text": "The paper explores the ethical challenge of testing for many cancers with a single test. When considering a cancer screening programme, the UK NSC weighs up the possible benefits of screening against the possible harms. Possible benefits include catching cancer early and improving survival, while possible harms include false positive and false negative results, as well as overdiagnosis, and overtreatment \u2013 the treatment of cancers that would never have caused harm."
        },
        {
            "text": "This process of assessing benefits and harms is potentially particularly challenging for MCDs because not all cancers detected by the test will benefit equally from early detection. For some cancers, screening may do more harm than good."
        },
        {
            "text": "Evaluating MCDs therefore involves assessing benefits and harms both collectively across all cancers detected and individually by cancer type. If the detection of certain cancers by an MCD shows no benefit or causes harm, any modification of the test or filtering of the screening results would raise questions about withholding information and respecting patient autonomy."
