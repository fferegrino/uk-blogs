            "text": "This blog launches a new co-design toolkit to support the development of services for early years. The co-design toolkit is a practical set of resources created to enable local authorities and communities to design public services together. It has been tested and developed with local authorities and members of the public in different locations across the country. Here, we introduce the toolkit, share reflections from those who helped to shape it and explore how it can be used to support collaborative service design in local government and beyond."

            "text": "Policy Lab was commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to work with local authorities and parents and carers to support the development of early years services offered through the joint DHSC and Department for Education Family Hubs and Start for Life programme. The programme includes a strong focus on the 1,001 days from conception to the age of two, which are crucial to a child\u2019s health, development and life chances."
        },
        {
            "text": "As part of the programme, local authorities receive funding to support parents, carers and families to co-design services, putting the needs of local babies and families at the centre of service design and delivery. The co-design toolkit emerged from a policy ambition to provide further support to bring the voices of parents and carers into the development of services which support families during those 1,001 critical days."
        },
        {
            "text": "In our initial phase of work, we engaged with nearly two thirds of the 75 local authorities receiving funding through the programme. This took place through a co-design workshop, survey and collective intelligence debate, helping us to better understand what local authorities needed to support the uptake of co-design approaches in early years services. Local authorities told us they wanted flexible, user-centred resources which could be adapted across different contexts and build on existing work. There was a strong appetite for less theory and more action."

            "text": "Our first phase of work identified the need for practical, hands-on support for local authorities to meaningfully involve people in the design of services. This pointed to the development of a co-design toolkit. In our second phase, we worked closely with parents and carers in six local authorities in Barnsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Camden, Durham, Lewisham, Sheffield to ensure the concept and content of the co-design toolkit worked on the ground, for both local authorities and families."
        },
        {
            "text": "We developed and tested the co-design toolkit in both in-person and online sessions with parents and carers, across varied environments. This included sessions with babies present, rooms without tables, and sessions with parents of children with Special Education Needs and Disabilities. Testing showed that the co-design approach and tools created space for meaningful participation by supporting quieter voices, sparking new conversations and providing just enough structure without being restrictive."

Although it has been tested in the context of early years services it can be adapted and used in other service areas. Since testing it, Parent and Carer Participation Leads in local authorities have continued to use the co-design toolkit as part of regular practice, supporting consistency, confidence and shared ownership."

This experience underpins the toolkit, which enables greater participation in service development and brings voices from inside and outside of government together. The toolkit also demonstrates a practical response to a national policy ambition to increase parent and carer involvement in service development and helps to unlock local capacity and knowledge."
