From this we could build out communications to reassure everyone from the beginning. User research identified that colleagues generally fell into 3 broad categories:"

From FAQs to an active inbox or a Teams call, we were ready to listen, troubleshoot or just be understanding. Cautious colleagues had concerns about replacement hardware, what files and work they could lose and how long the process might take. Being proactive allowed us to alleviate worries quickly and in the moment. "

All teams involved were ready to provide extra support for those who needed it to help everybody feel valued and supported. We worked closely with accessibility teams to ensure that colleagues with extra software, such as screen readers, had these installed on their replacement laptop when they made the switch.

When we talk about upgrades, we often focus on the tech: new features, faster performance, better security. However, the DBT Windows 11 rollout has reminded us that technical change is also emotional change. How we support people through it matters just as much as the upgrade itself. We have, of course, taken many learnings from this project and will continue to improve how we deliver changes like this to our colleagues in future. Behind every laptop is a real person, reminding us that change isn\u2019t about systems, it\u2019s about people."
