Once someone has recovered from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body and then can reactivate later in life and present as shingles because of decreased immunity \u2013 either with increasing age or immunosuppression. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk of shingles later in life."

            "text": "The first sign is often a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin, sometimes accompanied by a headache or feeling generally unwell. A rash typically appears a few days later, initially as blotches, then itchy fluid-filled blisters which crust over and finally heal. The rash appears on one side of the face or body only - a rash on both sides is unlikely to be shingles. You can see images of the shingles rash on the NHS website."

Check full eligibility information on the NHS website."
