Balancing this with gaining a mix of perspectives and expertise is always a challenge. In the Digital and Data world, we face the added challenge that only 23% of\u00a0people working in STEM roles in the UK are women, according to this PwC Women in Tech report. Whilst all forms of diversity are clearly important, the lack of women potentially in the recruitment \u2018pool\u2019 means we have to make a concerted effort on this specific area. Attracting more women into technology roles is a priority for DBT, not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because it makes us a stronger organisation."
