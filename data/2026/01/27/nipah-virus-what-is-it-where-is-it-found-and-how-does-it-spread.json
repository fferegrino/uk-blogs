While the risk to most people remains very low, understanding this virus is important if you are planning to travel to one of the areas where it circulates. No cases have ever been found in the UK."

            "text": "Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus, meaning it can be spread from animals to humans. It can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly from human to human. It was first identified in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore."

            "text": "The most serious complication is encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis, which typically develops 3 to 21 days after the initial illness begins. This is the hallmark of Nipah infection and is associated with a very high mortality rate."

            "text": "It is estimated that between 40 and 75% of people infected with Nipah virus will die. Some survivors may be left with lasting neurological difficulties, including persistent seizures and personality changes. In rare cases, the virus can reactivate months or even years after the initial infection."

Date palm juice is often known as Khejur Juice when raw and as Tari\u00a0or\u00a0Khajuri Tadi when fermented."

            "text": "Person-to-person spread is possible through close contact with an infected person or their body fluids. This has been documented in Bangladesh and India, most commonly among family members and close contacts caring for infected patients. Those with respiratory symptoms may pose a transmission risk."

UKHSA and The Pirbright Institute are supporting the development of vaccines against henipavirus \u2013 a genus (or group) of viruses including Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an epidemic threat requiring urgent research and development action, including vaccine development."

In Bangladesh, where Nipah virus outbreaks occur regularly, we\u2019re working with local partners to research a model that has worked well in other contexts and deliver an education programme in local schools. By teaching children about Nipah virus and how to avoid infection, they can share this knowledge with their families - helping to protect entire communities."
