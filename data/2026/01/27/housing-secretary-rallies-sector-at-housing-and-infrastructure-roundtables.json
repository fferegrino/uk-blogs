Looking with optimism to what 2026 can bring for the sector, he urged everyone to meet the government\u2019s level of urgency and ambition."

This Act really delivers on that promise. Developers and investors are already shrinking their project programmes thanks to this Act. Applications for nationally significant infrastructure will now be made earlier and consented faster. The removal of years of onerous pre-application admin and lengthy reports [in favour of meaningful engagement] is particularly welcome, as is the creation of easier access rights for vital surveys, and the power for developers to opt for the quickest consenting route for their project. Beyond these changes and the many others made by the Act, the pro-development attitude of this Government is in itself having a marked impact on investor sentiment towards greenfield development in the UK.\"\u00a0"
