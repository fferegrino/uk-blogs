            "text": "While we were successful in helping thousands of leaseholders get out of doubling ground rent terms, problematic ground rents continue to be a major issue for homeowners across the country. Government intervention in this area is likely to be the only way to achieve an effective, long-lasting solution.High ground rents can cause a wide range of problems, even where they don\u2019t double. During our investigation, we saw no persuasive evidence that ground rent was either legally or commercially necessary, or that consumers received anything in return for paying these annual fees. But we also recognise that changes to ground rents have implications for freeholders."
