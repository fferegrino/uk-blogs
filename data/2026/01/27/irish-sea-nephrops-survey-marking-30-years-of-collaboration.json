The Marine Institute (MI), Republic of Ireland, commenced in 2002, shortly following by Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), Northern Ireland, in 2003 and the approach continued to be adopted by other institutes.\u00a0 Now, well over 20 discreet Nephrops fisheries areas off Iceland and Scandinavia down to the Bay of Biscay and Mediterranean are regularly surveyed by a range of organisations across Europe."

Over four decades, she has played an important role in supporting marine and fisheries research, contributing to our understanding of the marine environment around the British Isles.\u00a0 She has been conducting UWTV surveys since 1996, firstly for Cefas, then, from 2006 for AFBI in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 AFBI continue to lead and co-ordinate joint surveys, currently conducted together with scientists from Cefas and the Marine Institute.\u00a0 The three organisations work together on the Corystes towards a common goal, to estimate the \u00a0number of Nephrops in the two main fishing areas of the Irish Sea.\u00a0 The exchange of knowledge between organisations is key to successfully surveying these challenging fishing areas."

            "text": "The first job is to identify where to survey.\u00a0 Fortunately, this is relatively straight-forward for Nephrops.\u00a0 Nephrops are burrowing decapod crustaceans, sharing the same family as larger European lobsters.\u00a0 Much like many terrestrial animals, they excavate and spend much of their lives in burrows, emerging only to forage and find a mate.\u00a0 Unlike European lobsters that prefer rockier habitat, Nephrops prefer softer sediment types to construct their burrows, typically in mud or muddy sand.\u00a0 Based on a combination of survey work to identify the sediment type and using fishing activity data, we can estimate the areas where the Nephrops live and then survey those locations."

            "text": "Muddy habitat is ideal for UWTV survey work as we can deploy a sledge system to survey the seabed.\u00a0 This allows us to obtain very consistent video footage, because we can keep the camera on the sledge at a fixed height above the seabed, even if the vessel above is moving around.\u00a0 The camera sledge does need to have sufficient lighting to illuminate the seabed for us to see the burrows clearly.\u00a0 It also has additional instrumentation to measure environmental variables such as temperature and clarity of the water.\u00a0 Finally, there is long communication cable, to bring the live video footage to the computers and scientists aboard the ship.\u00a0 All this gear makes the sledge relatively heavy, meaning we need a relatively large vessel to deploy and recover the sledge."

She is equipped with advanced laboratories, winches, trawl gear, and hydrographic instruments. Her robust design allows for research activities in challenging sea conditions, making her suitable for a variety of scientific missions:\u00a0 oceanography, environmental monitoring and, of course, fisheries surveys."

Commissioned by the British government for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), later Defra and Cefas, before being transferred to Northern Ireland to be operated by AFBI from 2006.\u00a0 The vessel was designed specifically for research purposes and over the years, she has undergone several refits to update her equipment and to comply with evolving safety standards. \u00a0Despite her age, these upgrades have ensured she remains at the forefront of marine research."
