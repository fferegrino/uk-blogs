            "text": "I began by outlining our origins in the establishment of the National Insurance Fund in 1919, and how we broadened our advice to support pensions for a growing public service. "

            "text": "Today GAD\u2019s actuaries contribute across a much broader range of policy areas, including climate risk, indemnity cover for clinical negligence, and providing independent quality assurance on the analytical evidence used in decision-making across government."

            "text": "Ahead of the event, I benefited from insight and background material provided by the British High Commission in Gaborone. It helped me to understand Botswana\u2019s current fiscal environment, from headwinds to ambitions to grow into a more resilient economy. "

            "text": "I hope that some of the UK\u2019s experience will help provide insight into how actuarial expertise can be deployed quickly and effectively."

            "text": "Personally, I was struck by how easy it was to deepen my understanding of Botswana simply by talking to those at the symposium. A handful of conversations, with plenty of open questions, gave me far more insight than I could have gained from my desk in London."
