PEBA are active in promoting equality and diversity in their profession.\u00a0 As\u00a0part of wider work towards\u00a0changing\u00a0identified\u00a0unacceptable practice\u00a0at the Bar, we recently held a joint\u00a0webinar\u00a0to specifically discuss elements of good and unacceptable practice at Inquiries.\u00a0\u00a0"

At the end of the day, the more time\u00a0we all\u00a0have to\u00a0spend\u00a0on managing poor behaviour, the less time is dedicated to the specific cases\u00a0and the evidence, and that is not helpful for anyone.\u00a0\u00a0"
