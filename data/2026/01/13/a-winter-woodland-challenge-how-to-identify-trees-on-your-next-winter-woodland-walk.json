            "text": "The shape of a tree and its bark can help with identifying common species. For instance, a mature oak has a broad, spreading crown even without leaves, while silver birch is unmistakably white and papery. But for more reliable identification, the twig and bud structure will be the parts of the tree you want to look at."

            "text": "A sycamore, for instance, has a large, green triplet terminal bud. An oak tree has a cluster of buds, while ash has really obvious black buds that look like a deer\u2019s hoof."
        },
        {
            "text": "As you look along the twig, the buds will be arranged in a distinct style and shape for each species. This is our second clue. Buds will be arranged in pairs opposite each other, or alternating along the stem. There are exceptions, such as lime, where the stem and buds have a distinct zigzag pattern, or pussy willow, where the buds spiral down the twig."
        },
        {
            "text": "The buds themselves help identify the tree. They will be rounded, pointy and sharp, or boxing glove shaped. They can be scaly, smooth or sticky. Some buds sit very close to the stem, while others are mounted on small pegs. Even these pegs can provide a clue. For instance, hawthorn buds, sit on a peg that resembles a pile of pancakes."

Spindle trees tend to be a grey-green colour, while hawthorn and goat willow are a distinct green colour. Lime is a very bright, distinctive red, while rowan, birch and sweet chestnut are all a much darker red."

Trees such as elm and field maple have very gnarled twigs, with deep horizontal grooves resembling a crocodile\u2019s back."
