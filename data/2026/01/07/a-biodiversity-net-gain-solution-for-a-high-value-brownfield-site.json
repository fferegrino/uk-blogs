The site contained a significant amount of open mosaic habitat (OMH), which is an important and complex type of wildlife habitat."

            "text": "The site covers 102 hectares and was once used as the coal yard for Blyth Power Station, which closed in 2001. Since then, the land has remained unused. Over time, different plant species have grown across the area, creating a mix of habitats typical of land that has previously been developed and then left to nature."

            "text": "Arcadis, the ecological consultants working with QTS (the developer), did a great deal to protect existing habitats and create new ones on site wherever possible. However, despite this, the project still faced a shortfall of 289 biodiversity units. This included 152 units of an ecologically important brownfield habitat known as open mosaic habitat (OMH) - by which we mean areas that are typically characterised by a mosaic of bare ground and other habitat types such as flower rich meadows, short, patchy grassland, scrub and wet areas. The individual compound habitats may not be notable in their own right, however, in combination they can create areas of high value for biodiversity."

        {
            "text": "This was a serious challenge. At the time, there simply weren\u2019t enough OMH units available to buy on the private market. Purchasing statutory biodiversity credits was not considered a financially attractive option in this case."

            "text": "Before QTS showed interest in the Cambois site, Northumberland County Council had already recognised the need for a clear biodiversity net gain (BNG) solution across the county\u2019s key employment sites. This was seen as vital for attracting major investors, who often compare different locations. By reducing the risks around meeting BNG requirements, the Council aimed to keep Northumberland competitive."

            "text": "One site identified as central to this plan was Potland Burn near Ashington. Recently restored after surface mining, the 275-hectare site is mainly covered in temporary grassland and does not contain high-quality agricultural soils. This made it an ideal \u201cblank canvas\u201d for creating a habitat bank \u2013 a place where new habitats can be developed to offset biodiversity losses elsewhere."

The issue centred on OMH, a rare and valuable type of habitat."

            "text": "Next to the new habitat bank is a small but very valuable area of land containing a mix of grassland, scrub, and wetlands, with plants such as dyer\u2019s greenweed, pepper saxifrage, and agrimony. This mosaic of habitats is not only important for its plant life but also supports a wide variety of birds, like Black Redstarts insects such as the Shrill Carder Bee and reptiles like grass snakes and common lizards."

            "text": "It seemed clear that copying this successful mix of habitats on the wider habitat bank land would be a good idea. Doing so would bring both botanical and wildlife benefits. This thinking led to exploring how Rule 4 of the Statutory Biodiversity Metric could apply in this situation, helping ensure that the new habitats deliver genuine ecological value."

For comparison, the average size of nature conservation sites in lowland Northumberland is 41.2 hectares, with many others being much smaller."
