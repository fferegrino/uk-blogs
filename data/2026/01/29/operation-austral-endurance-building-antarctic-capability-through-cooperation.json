The task formed part of the UK\u2019s routine, treaty\u2011compliant presence and helped mitigate the temporary absence of HMS PROTECTOR from the region. The intent is to continue building Antarctic cooperation and capability, strengthening the UK\u2019s ability to support British Antarctic Survey and conduct safe, effective operations in the region."

Operation AUSTRAL ENDURANCE is conducted fully within this framework."
