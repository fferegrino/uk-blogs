After several years in clinical practice in Australia, South Africa, and the UK, I moved into disease control and epidemiology by way of masters degrees at the Royal Veterinary College and Imperial College London. I\u2019ve been working exclusively on AMR since I started my PhD at Imperial in 2015, which focused on mathematical and statistical modelling of the associations between antimicrobial use and resistance in different populations. This work has given me a deep understanding of AMR evolution and spread, and I\u2019ve been bringing this expertise to bear in my current role since 2020."
