            "text": "Today, 29 January 2026, we are publishing OFSI\u2019s public consultation response on proposed changes to our enforcement processes. Under our revised framework, these changes will support compliance, give firms greater certainty and ensure our approach to enforcing financial sanctions is fair, effective and robust."

            "text": "In 2025, a cross-government review of sanctions implementation and enforcement identified ways to further strengthen UK sanctions and increase the deterrent effect of enforcement. As part of that review, we identified five proposals to make resolving enforcement cases quicker, easier and more transparent. OFSI sought feedback through a 12-week public consultation, including by running a webinar with 615 participants to share information and seek feedback. I want to thank those who engaged with the consultation. These measures are better and will be more effective as a result of that engagement. We intend to proceed with all proposals from the original consultation, incorporating feedback from responses to the consultation. Proposals not requiring legislation will come into effect when OFSI\u2019s updated Enforcement and Monetary Penalties guidance is published in February 2026."

            "text": "Enforcement of financial sanctions is a critical part of OFSI\u2019s work in promoting and improving compliance. Robust and proportionate enforcement supports the integrity of the UK\u2019s financial system and helps sanctions achieve their overall objectives to advance the UK\u2019s foreign and security priorities. Over the past 12 months, we have imposed five penalties and issued two Disclosures for breaches of financial sanctions. While penalties are the most visible aspect of our enforcement activity, many other cases have been resolved through warning letters, engagement with firms, or no further action outcomes where appropriate."

            "text": "Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in both the volume and complexity of enforcement investigations, largely following Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As of April 2025, OFSI had 240 active cases under investigation, up from 172 as of April 2023. The changes we are making now will ensure that OFSI is in the best possible position to enforce financial sanctions in a more focused, responsive, and efficient posture."

This will be done through a variety of\u00a0means, but the Early Account Scheme\u00a0will be one\u00a0way we aim to\u00a0expedite\u00a0investigations where\u00a0appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Where OFSI decides to take enforcement action following an investigation, resolving cases through the Settlement Scheme means getting outcomes and the lessons of those outcomes into the public domain quicker. Faster outcomes allow OFSI to be more responsive to new risks or the heightened importance of different sanctions regimes, and for subjects to resolve uncertainty more quickly and focus their efforts on improving their compliance rather than responding to an investigation."

            "text": "All proposals, except for changes to the statutory maximum penalty amount, will be implemented in the coming weeks through updates to OFSI\u2019s public enforcement guidance. The updated guidance will explain how these updates to our enforcement processes will operate in practice, as well as simplifying and streamlining the guidance more widely. Once businesses have had time to digest both OFSI\u2019s consultation and the forthcoming guidance, we will be hosting a webinar for interested parties. Changing the statutory maximum amount for civil monetary penalties requires legislative change and will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows."

Whilst our primary means for gathering information from subjects\u00a0will still be in writing, we want to\u00a0give subjects the opportunity to provide relevant and useful information to OFSI\u00a0in\u00a0the most effective way\u00a0possible.\u00a0This may include meetings to discuss the technical details of a case\u00a0or wider information which might\u00a0assist\u00a0OFSI in its investigation.\u00a0"
