Well, there\u2019s nothing hotter than the fire of the Dragons \u2013 and nothing more heart-warming than seeing entrepreneurs' dreams being realised as the Dragons invest in businesses that mean so much to them. So, seeing the new series back on our screens, I grabbed a warm beverage and the last of the Christmas chocolate to see what this year\u2019s entrepreneurs would have in store."

A new guest Dragon will be joining each week, and for this episode the guest was Jenna Meek, CEO of beauty brand REFY\u00ae who was ready and waiting to meet tonight\u2019s band of keen hopefuls."

            "text": "The first entrepreneur who excitedly entered the famous lift was Chloe Messer, founder of Hat \u2018n\u2019 Spicy \u2013 a maximalist accessories brand that specialises in making custom, made to order upcycled fluffy hats from sustainable materials. Chloe came to impress, with a custom hat for each Dragon. Seeing the Dragons each donning a large fluffy hat certainly made them seem less intimidating! She was asking the Dragons for \u00a350,000 in exchange for a 15% stake of her business. \u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Not all of the Dragons were feeling hot about the hat investment potential \u2013 but luckily for Chloe, two of them were biting. Original Dragon Peter Jones and retail mogul Touker Suleyman agreed to enter a partnership, each contributing \u00a325,000 for 15%. Despite agreeing to double the equity she had originally hoped to part with, the entrepreneur jumped at the offer and accepted, hopefully keeping the pair in fluffy headwear for life."

            "text": "Next to enter the Den was Murad Huseynov, seeking a \u00a370,000 investment in return for a 4% stake in his business Mosaic Journal. The company delivers a photo album and has a corresponding app where you can upload a memory each day. Once a month\u00a0, the photos you chose for the month get delivered straight to your door, ready to slot in, to create a journal of your life in pictures. This idea certainly appeals to me. I have, admittedly, too many photos in my camera roll and love reflecting on some of my favourite memories."

            "text": "Murad had certainly captured the attention of the Dragons, and it was Deborah Meaden and Steven Bartlett who wanted to get in on the picture. Deborah made the first offer \u2013 all of the money that the entrepreneur had been hoping for, in exchange for a 12% stake. Social media king Steven Bartlett was next, but asking for an additional 3%."

            "text": "Due to the social nature of the app that Murad created, after attempting to negotiate he asked Steven one simple question \u2013 do you love it? \u201cYes, I love it\u201d replied Steven, confirmation enough for the owner of Mosaic Journal that the collaboration was worth parting ways with the greater equity share. They shook hands on the deal of 15% for an investment of \u00a370,000."

Gulshen was hoping for a \u00a325,000 investment in exchange for a 10%\u00a0stake of her franchise business."

A quick look on our trade mark search tool reveals that she has wisely protected this part of her IP. She has registered trade marks for her name and logo, as well as for one further logo that is currently under examination."
