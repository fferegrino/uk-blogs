            "text": "Over the past 150 years, there has been a huge evolution in the contexts within which\u00a0trade marks\u00a0are used. The\u00a0Trade Marks\u00a0Registration Act of 1875 limited\u00a0trade marks\u00a0to relating to goods. Over time legislation was expanded so that\u00a0trade marks\u00a0could also be registered in relation to services. A core principle of\u00a0trade mark\u00a0law is that\u00a0trade marks\u00a0are used\u00a0in the course of\u00a0business. Historically this would have related to physical\u00a0commerce\u00a0but the invention of the world wide web enabled the advertising of goods and services online, as well as e-commerce. As a result,\u00a0trade marks\u00a0are being used and interacted with in digital contexts more than ever before and in relation to goods and services someone in 1875 could never had imagined.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "These changing contexts could be having an impact on the types of\u00a0trade marks\u00a0being applied for. Previously the law defined\u00a0trade marks\u00a0in part as being \u201csigns capable of being represented graphically\u201d (Directive 2008/95/EC). This graphic representation requirement was later repealed with\u00a0trade mark\u00a0criteria being expanded to signs \u201c\u2026being represented on the register in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.\u201d (Directive (EU) 2015/2436). This provides a far more flexible definition of a\u00a0trade mark\u00a0and the IPO now sees more applications for \u201cunconventional\u201d marks, such as motion marks (UK00003592978), multimedia marks (UK00004103352) and holograms (UK00003375918). The flexibility in the definition of a\u00a0trade mark\u00a0means we could see\u00a0trade marks\u00a0registered in new forms in the future.\u00a0\u00a0"
