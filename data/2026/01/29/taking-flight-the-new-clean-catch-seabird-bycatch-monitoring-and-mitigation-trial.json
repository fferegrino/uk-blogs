The APPG is a cross-party forum in Parliament that brings together parliamentarians and stakeholders to discuss fisheries policy, sustainability and industry concerns. The meeting, chaired by Melanie Onn MP, was titled Rebuilding Trust: Fisheries, Science, Management and focused on the low levels of trust between the fishing industry, scientists, managers and policymakers\u2014particularly in government\u2014and how this can undermine effective fisheries management in the UK."

            "text": "The event brought together scientific directors, researchers and fishermen to explore why trust has eroded and how it can be rebuilt through collaboration. Speakers shared case studies and developed recommendations for more sustainable, resilient and prosperous UK fisheries. Clean Catch, alongside its collaborating partner Dale Rodmell Chief Executive at the Eastern England Fish Producer\u2019s Organisation (EEFPO), presented insights on how collaborative, fisher-led approaches can generate practical, evidence-based knowledge to address complex marine challenges."

The programme is delivered by a consortium of partners\u2014Arribada Initiative, Cefas, Mindfully Wired, MMO Consultancy and the Zoological Society of London\u2014bringing expertise in technology development, scientific trials, communications, knowledge exchange and social science."

            "text": "Working closely with fisheries, Clean Catch employs fishery liaison officers at trial sites to ensure fishermen\u2019s knowledge and voices are heard and are central to the trial delivery. The Clean Catch programme is underpinned by an equitable governance framework that supports fisher-led, science-based activities and transparent decision-making. This collaborative approach brings together fishing industries, environmental non-government organisations (eNGOs) and scientists, fostering trust and cooperation at local, national and expert levels."

Following the implementation of a cetacean bycatch mitigation trial with static net fishermen in the southwest of England, the programme expanded in 2024 into a second phase. This phase focuses on a different group of sensitive species, a new region and a different fishing gear type."

The application, submitted by EEFPO on behalf of two fishing companies, focused on improving the evidence base around seabird interactions with fishing operations, including interactions with warp cables and observations of seabirds entering trawl gear. The fishery expressed interest in trialling bird-scaring lines as a means of evaluating their effectiveness and potential behavioural responses, with the aim of demonstrating whether seabird bycatch is an issue within the fishery and ensuring that any mitigation measures do not inadvertently alter seabird foraging behaviour."

Fishing takes place year-round, except in extreme weather, with trips typically lasting seven to eight days and fishing operations running day and night."

These introductory discussions with vessel owners and skippers provided valuable insights into fishing operations, seabird behaviour around vessels and the practicalities of potential monitoring and mitigation tools. Early engagement with the fishery was essential to inform the design of a scientifically robust and operationally realistic trial."

Physical interactions between seabirds and warp cables were observed to be brief and cryptic in nature, helping to explain why such events may not always be noticed during routine fishing operations. Large numbers of seabirds were also observed gathering around vessels during catch processing, when offal is discharged, increasing the likelihood of collisions with the warps."

These findings will play a key role in guiding the wider Clean Catch programme, strengthening our understanding of bycatch risks and helping to progress mitigation options that have been codesigned with industry and are ready for adoption, where supported by evidence."
