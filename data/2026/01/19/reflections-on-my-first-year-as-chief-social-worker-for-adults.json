Moving from a local to national leadership position was a huge change from being responsible for multiple teams to a small office of 3 people; from operational and budget preoccupations to grappling with national policy levers to impact change and from local politicians to meetings with Ministers."

We are also enabling people to have more choice and control over their care, by promoting greater use of direct payments and expanding care options to boost independent living at home through a Disabled Facilities Grant. Lastly, we are strengthening the join-up between health and social care services, so that people experience more integrated and person-centred care, by developing neighbourhood health services.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Good quality social work that enables people to have choice and control, to be connected and to live healthy and happy lives in their own homes, is vital to achieving this ambition.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"

It\u2019s important to recognise the huge amount of hard work involved and the emotional toll for some colleagues.\u00a0Reflecting on the first round of baseline assessments soon finishing, overall, the process has shone a light on the importance of high-quality practice, supported by leaders across the whole organisation. Assessments have - and will continue to - play an important role in supporting the delivery of government's key ambitions and ministerial priorities.\u00a0CQC are currently considering the learnings from baseline assessments and will be shortly setting out the next steps.
