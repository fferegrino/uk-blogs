            "text": "Committee members recognised the devastating impact of MLD and thanked the many individuals and organisations who had responded to the consultation. Members found that more research and evaluation are needed to explore the case for screening further and therefore reiterated their recommendation not to screen for MLD."

MLD has been identified as a good candidate for inclusion in this type of evaluation, which could provide valuable information on the performance of MLD screening in UK newborns."

            "text": "The committee also restated its recommendation not to offer adult population screening for dementia because of the lack of an accurate and reliable test and limited treatments. Members again thanked all those who had responded to the consultation."
