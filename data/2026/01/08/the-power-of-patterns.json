In public policy and service design, that\u2019s exactly what we need more of. We need approaches that make it easier for people to use government services, and easier for teams to deliver them well."

            "text": "Across government, teams are grappling with common challenges: tightening budgets, rising demand, and the people who use our services expecting digital services to \u201cjust work.\u201d Amid these pressures, the real innovation isn\u2019t about reinventing the wheel but about scaling what already works."
