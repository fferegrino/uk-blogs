UKHSA's yellow alerts focus on people who are particularly vulnerable - such as older adults and those with certain long-term health conditions. At this level, action is essential within health and social care settings."

A cold snap that poses little risk to most of the population can be dangerous for older adults or people with heart conditions. A heatwave that doesn't meet the threshold for a national weather warning may still require urgent action in hospitals and care homes. By maintaining a dedicated Weather-Health Alert system alongside the Met Office's National Severe Weather Warning Service, we ensure that health and social care professionals receive targeted, actionable guidance - while the public continues to benefit from broader weather warnings. Both systems work together to protect lives."
