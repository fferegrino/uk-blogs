The \u2018needs attention\u2019 grade is not a \u2018fail\u2019. As we explain in our video for parents, \u2018needs attention\u2019 is an indication that there is work to be done to reach the \u2018expected standard\u2019 and it highlights where issues can be addressed before they become bigger problems that need \u2018urgent improvement\u2019."
