It mainly affects babies and young children, typically those aged between 6 months and 3 years, though most cases occur in 1-year-olds. Boys tend to be affected more than girls, and croup is most common during late autumn and early winter. A child can get croup more than once."

The viruses that cause croup spread through close contact with infected people, contaminated surfaces, or by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes. Exactly how long someone is infectious for will depend on the virus that is the underlying cause but generally someone who is infected will be most contagious in the first few days when symptoms like fever and cold-like symptoms appear."
