Programmatic checking allows whoever is doing the ID check to access these, with a user\u2019s consent, and make sure everything is as it should be. This means reduced fraud, fewer fake credentials, and greater confidence in everyday interactions with your credential, whether it\u2019s in a shop or online."

This year, we\u2019ll enable them to test how they will share data from the digital driving licence with third parties, before full rollout later in the year, so they can play their part in making the digital driving licence useful across the range of services where users currently use their physical licences."
