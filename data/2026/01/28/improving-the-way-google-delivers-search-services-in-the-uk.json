Throughout, the CMA is applying its \u20184Ps\u2019 - proportionality, pace, predictability and process \u2013 to ensure we avoid hampering innovation or creating uncertainty for businesses and investors."

Our goal is to support innovation and growth, ensure people benefit from a high-quality digital experience, deliver fairer outcomes for content publishers and help businesses and consumers make active, informed choices. This is an important milestone, as these are the first set of conduct requirements under the digital markets competition regime."

Millions of people rely on it as a gateway to the internet, and over 200,000 UK firms spent more than \u00a310 billion on Google search advertising last year. Search is central to the economy and everyday life \u2013 and increasingly relies on AI-generated responses \u2013 so it is essential that competition works well."

Other potential measures relate to action in other jurisdictions, including the US (where a final remedies judgment in an important case was made in December) and the EU (where, amongst other things, Google\u2019s compliance with a requirement about self-preferencing is being investigated). We are assessing what these developments mean for the UK."
