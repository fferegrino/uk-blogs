It is home to thriving communities, beautiful landscapes and vital infrastructure that we all rely on. But the coast is also one of the places where the impacts of climate change are being felt most clearly."

Without the long-term actions set out in Shoreline Management Plans, that number could rise to 32,800."

That is why since 2022, the Environment Agency has managed the Coastal Transition Accelerator Programme (CTAP), working in partnership with communities such as East Riding of Yorkshire and North Norfolk. These projects have supported some of the most vulnerable communities to adapt and transition away from parts of the coast that cannot be defended in the long term."

They have experienced teams, strong relationships with their communities and a solid evidence base built up over many years of monitoring and evaluation. This means they can hit the ground running, delivering practical, value-for-money actions over the next three years. In some locations, this could include selective property purchase where there is both community support and a clear benefit to the public purse."
