We are making development quicker,\u00a0simpler,\u00a0and cheaper, cutting red tape to get homes built faster.\u00a0"

Developers\u00a0understand and respect their\u00a0legal\u00a0obligation to\u00a0safeguard our most endangered wildlife, and they bear\u00a0the cost of this responsibility.\u00a0 But we must avoid this responsibility becoming an obstacle to important new housing delivery.\u00a0Natural England\u2019s role as a public conservation body is to help developers meet their obligations in the most effective and straight forward way possible."

However, the alternative\u00a0is for a\u00a0developer\u00a0to commission surveys of individual sites to determine whether they need to apply for specific licences. The seasonal nature of survey work can create uncertainty and delay which no business welcomes.\u00a0 For this reason, most developers actively choose to use District Level Licensing, with over 65% of all newt license applications opting for this solution \u2013 because it is the best choice for their business. \u00a0"
