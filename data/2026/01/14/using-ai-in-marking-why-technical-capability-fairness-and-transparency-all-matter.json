Rather than providing definitive answers, the published working paper offers an overview of the topic, shares our current thinking, highlights key challenges, and aims to stimulate further debate across the sector. This blog offers a taster of the questions we\u2019re grappling with as we consider the future of AI in marking."

            "text": "Our conclusion is clear: AI is promising for quality assurance and marker training, but for the moment it\u2019s nowhere near ready to take over high stakes marking. Our position remains that the use of AI as the sole mechanism for awarding marks does not comply with our current regulations."

            "text": "High stakes qualifications represent a social contract between students, educators and society. Students invest years of effort into their education with legitimate expectations about how their work will be assessed, and how their qualifications will be valued and accepted by others. Currently, those expectations include having their exams marked by trained human examiners who understand both the subject matter and the assessment criteria, and who apply their academic judgement fairly and consistently."

            "text": "Qualifications only hold value when students, parents, teachers and employers have confidence in their fairness, transparency and legitimacy. Any change to marking, particularly involving automation, must be carefully considered for its impact on this fundamental trust."

            "text": "Current AI technologies, especially large language models and deep neural networks, have advanced capabilities but lack true semantic understanding and the capacity for human-like judgement. These systems often function as \u2018black boxes\u2019, making it difficult even for experts to explain how specific marks are generated. This lack of transparency is a major challenge for maintaining trust in qualifications."

        {
            "text": "We must be able to understand how marks are determined. If explanations and evidence for why certain marks were offered are unreliable, or not even available, the fundamental contract of assessment breaks down."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is a basic principle that underpins public trust and perceptions of fairness that students can challenge exam marking and secure a review. However, when marks are generated by AI, explanations and evidence for why certain marks were awarded may be unreliable, unavailable, or difficult to interpret, making it harder to uphold the transparency and accountability essential for trust in qualifications. There is much more work to do to understand and agree what this would mean where exams have been marked by AI rather than by a human marker. We explore these issues in more detail in our research paper."

        {
            "text": "Additionally, AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases present in their training data, and empirical studies have shown that performance can vary across different demographic groups. Ensuring that criteria are applied consistently and fairly, regardless of candidate or marker identity, is a core principle of valid assessment."
