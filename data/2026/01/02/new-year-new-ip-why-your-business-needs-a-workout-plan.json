Everyone else seemed to know exactly what they were doing, I wasn\u2019t sure which machine did what, and I was convinced that people were judging my technique. Overall, it felt extremely intimidating. But here's what I learnt: nobody is watching, they're all too busy focusing on their own workout.\u00a0"

You might think your business isn't \"big enough\", or that IP protection is only for major corporations with legal teams. But just as you don't need to be an Olympic or Paralympic athlete to benefit from the gym, you don't need to be a multinational company to protect what makes your business unique.\u00a0"

Your IP might feel small now, but like those early gym sessions, small consistent efforts build up over time. The trade mark you register today could become extremely valuable as your reputation grows, and you could use that patent to attract inward investment or license your service or product.\u00a0"
