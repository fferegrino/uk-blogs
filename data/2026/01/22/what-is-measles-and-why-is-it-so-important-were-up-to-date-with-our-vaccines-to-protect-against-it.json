There has been a resurgence of measles in England and around the world in recent years. In 2024 there were\u00a02,911 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded annually in decades. Figures reported for 2025 to date record 957 laboratory-confirmed measles cases. Most of these cases have been in unvaccinated children under the age of 10. \u00a0"

This is giving measles a chance to get a foothold in our communities. Achieving high vaccination coverage across the population is important as it also indirectly helps protect very young infants (under 1) and other vulnerable groups.\u00a0"
