She provides a useful analogy: \u2018an animal is a system, a tree is a system, and a forest is a larger system that encompasses subsystems of trees and animals\u2019. A system is made up of interconnected parts, the sum of which is greater than the whole."

The Centre for Complexity Across the Nexus have done incredible work in bringing systems thinking into complex systems such as food systems, transport, and now through my work at VISION Consortium, can engage with violence and abuse issues. Civil Service\u2019s Policy Design Community also teach systems thinking as an important part of public design practice."

This framework began with evaluation to inform violence prevention pathways, and has advanced into informing and enhancing delivery of VAWG strategy development."
