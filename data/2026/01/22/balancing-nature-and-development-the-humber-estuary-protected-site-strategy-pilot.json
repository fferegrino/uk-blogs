Or\u00a0maybe you\u00a0think of the busy docks and industrial sites that make this region a hub for business. Both are true.\u00a0Here, wildlife and industry share the same busy landscape,\u00a0and\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0what makes the Humber such an interesting, and sometimes tricky, place to work.\u00a0"

But these birds\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0just stick to the protected area. They also rely on surrounding farmland and grassland for feeding and roosting. These areas, called Functionally Linked Land (FLL), are essential for their survival. As the Humber grows as a centre for offshore wind, hydrogen production, and carbon capture, these habitats are under more pressure than ever.\u00a0"

            "text": "Right now, planning decisions involving FLL can be slow, costly, and uncertain. A lot of time and money goes into figuring out how important a site is for birds and what needs to be done if habitat is lost. This process isn\u2019t great for anyone, and it doesn\u2019t always give the best results for nature. That money could be better spent creating bigger, better-connected habitats rather than lots of small, isolated ones."

            "text": "The Humber is one of the UK\u2019s most important estuaries for wildlife, supporting around 135,000 waterbirds each year. While the estuary itself is protected, many of these birds rely on surrounding farmland and grassland for feeding and roosting, especially at high tide when mudflats are underwater. Much of this land is productive arable farmland, so any approach needs to consider how wildlife and food production can work side by side."

            "text": "These areas of Functionally Linked Land (FLL) provide safe places for birds to rest and forage when intertidal zones are submerged or disturbed."
        },
        {
            "text": "If birds lose access to these sites, they have to fly further to find food and shelter, using more energy and reducing their chances of survival. This can affect their ability to get through the winter, migrate successfully, or breed in future seasons. Loss of FLL has already been linked to population declines on the Humber, so finding ways to protect and restore these areas is essential."
        },
        {
            "text": "At the same time, the Humber is critical to the UK\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy, with major investment in offshore wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture. Without a strategic approach, these priorities can clash. With the right plan, we can make better decisions and avoid unnecessary conflict, protecting wildlife while supporting sustainable growth."

What proves to be workable will emerge over time through conversations with stakeholders and partners. However, we are excited to see what we will be able to achieve."

What happens in the wider area, whether farming, development, or industry, affects the estuary, and the estuary influences those activities too. They\u2019re all part of the same system, which means we need to work together and plan as one if we want nature and development to thrive."
