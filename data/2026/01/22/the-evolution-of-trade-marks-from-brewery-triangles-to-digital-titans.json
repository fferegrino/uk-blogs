It\u2019s a simple lesson in what a good trade mark looks like \u2013 it\u2019s distinctive and bold and instantly reminds you of the company behind the brand."

It's your handshake, your storefront, and your guarantee rolled into one."

You can travel to unfamiliar countries, but as long as you\u2019re in one of the more than 15,000 cities Uber operates in you can use a service that you know and trust \u2013 and you\u2019ll be able to get that 6am ride to the airport."

A trade mark registration doesn't just protect a logo \u2013 it protects customer relationships, market position, and business value. It's an investment that, unlike machinery or property, doesn't depreciate. Maintain and use it properly, like Bass, and that trade mark can protect your business forever and be the catalyst for growth."
