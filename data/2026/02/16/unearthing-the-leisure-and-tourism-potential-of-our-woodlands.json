They also offer a source of timber, capture carbon and provide many other benefits. Yet their potential for leisure, tourism and local economic opportunities are not always as obvious."

We know people made an estimated 748 million visits to UK woodlands in 20222 for recreation and tourism, with those visitors spending an estimated \u00a3907 million during those trips (\u00a3685 million in England)3 \u2013 but this is only part of the picture."
