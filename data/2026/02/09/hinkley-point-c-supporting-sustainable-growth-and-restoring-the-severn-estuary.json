            "text": "Hinkley Point C will be the UK's largest nuclear power station, providing low-carbon energy to millions of homes. But building it in the Severn Estuary, one of Britain's most important habitats for fish and marine life, brings significant environmental challenges. In this blog, we explain how Natural England and our partners are working with EDF to ensure the power station can be built while protecting the estuary's wildlife, to find practical solutions to prevent millions of fish being harmed by the plant's\u00a0water-cooling intakes."

The estuary also plays a crucial role in the lifecycle of a range of endangered migratory fish species including Atlantic Salmon. It is for these reasons that the estuary and some of its species are protected by law."

Restoring the Severn Estuary will provide benefits that go far beyond wildlife, providing benefits for people, local communities, and economies, including a greater resilience to the challenges of climate change."

            "text": "Nuclear power stations require a huge amount of water for cooling. At Hinkley Point C, 132 cubic metres of water will need to be sucked up from the estuary every second to cool the turbine condensers. This is the equivalent to drawing 190 Olympic-sized swimming pools full of water from the estuary every hour. EDF estimate that over 7 million fish will be drawn into the intakes annually, and it is expected that around 2.6 million a year are likely to die as a result. As such, putting in place these measures is essential for preventing serious consequences for protected fish populations in our waters and impacts on the fishing industry."

This includes Atlantic salmon which are now classed as endangered following a population crash of nearly 50% in the UK over the last twenty years. A practical solution needs to be found."

EDF have decided to pursue the option of installing an acoustic fish deterrent\u2013 a device that will use sound to guide fish and other marine life away from the intakes to stop them being drawn into Hinkley\u2019s cooling system. "

        {
            "text": "While Acoustic Fish Deterrents are untested in this kind of environment, we have been really encouraged by the data that is emerging around their effectiveness. Continued testing monitoring and adaptation of the system will be needed over the coming years if we are to build our confidence that impacts on fish populations over time will be avoided. This evidence\u00a0is vital to explore whether further mitigation would be required."
