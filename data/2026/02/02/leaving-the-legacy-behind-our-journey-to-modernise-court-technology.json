The new infrastructure reduces the risk of system failures and enables us to implement security updates more efficiently, maintaining our commitment to keep citizen data safe, expanding resources according to demand and supporting continuous improvement."

            "text": "When people think of court technology, they often picture video hearings or case management systems. But behind the scenes, there\u2019s a vital layer of infrastructure that keeps everything running smoothly. For years, this foundation relied on outdated systems and ageing equipment, putting the stability of court services and the delivery of justice at increasing risk."

        {
            "text": "Our old systems were running on approximately 2,500 pieces of outdated hardware in two physical data centres in Park Royal and Swindon. Many of these were so old that finding replacement parts was nearly impossible. This created a fragile environment with single points of failure that could disrupt access to essential court services."

            "text": "As the equipment continued to age, the risk of serious failure grew, and action was needed to protect the justice system from potential breakdowns."

            "text": "Since 2020, we have worked to modernise 37 different applications running in these vulnerable data centres. The complexity and variety of the technologies involved required several distinct solutions, with a carefully planned approach needed for each. Applications that were no longer needed were decommissioned, while others were upgraded and moved to secure, cloud-based platforms. Another group of systems was moved to a specially created temporary hosting facility where they can continue to reliably and securely operate reliably and securely while we plan their eventual replacement or retirement."

        {
            "text": "Two of the most important systems were completely rebuilt. Instead of simply moving them they were redesigned, creating flexible platforms that can evolve as business needs change. One of these, Juror Digital, replaced three separate jury management tools with a single streamlined system. The other, Digital Audio Recording Transcription\u00a0and Storage\u00a0(DARTS) is the Crown Court recording system. This was one of the most complex projects that we have tackled, and I will explore it in more detail in my next blog."

            "text": "Moving services to more stable environments has already improved reliability. As we continue to enhance our systems, our modernised criminal case management system Common Platform will become the central hub for managing all magistrate and Crown Court cases, documents and scheduling. To support this, we\u2019re building tools to transfer data from older systems such as Libra Web, Court Store and Xhibit into this new platform."
