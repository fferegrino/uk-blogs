The toolkit has been designed to help people understand the potential impacts and suitability of reintroducing beavers to different watercourses or waterbodies across England, as well as the potential effects of existing wild populations."

            "text": "In February 2025, the Government\u00a0announced\u00a0its commitment to wild beaver reintroductions in England, marking a historic day for nature recovery. Beaver presence is known to bring clear benefits to the surrounding environment by enhancing biodiversity, improving water quality, alleviating flooding, and helping to reduce droughts. Nevertheless, wild beaver activity might have an impact, positively or negatively, on many environmental and socio-economic factors (\u201cconsiderations\u201d). "

            "text": "A list of potential considerations that might be affected by beaver activity was drawn from the 2021 evidence review and fine-tuned through workshops and discussions with Natural England and Environment Agency technical experts, as well as external stakeholders (e.g., Beaver Trust). Datasets reflecting these considerations were sourced at a national scale, providing a range of considerations that are included within the toolkit and grouped into five categories: designated sites, habitat and species, hydrology, infrastructure, and land use. Some examples of considerations include urban areas, agricultural land, designated sites, national grid structures, ancient woodland, and many more!"

            "text": "The BCAT can be used to identify which considerations are present in any given area across England. Users can draw and create custom areas of interest. The toolkit then provides a summary of the custom area, including the type and number of considerations present (Figure 1). These flagged considerations can be visualised on a map. "
        },
        {
            "text": "All consideration datasets can be visualised at a landscape-scale on the map. Because it is subjective as to whether the possible impacts from beaver activity are thought to be positive or negative, the toolkit simply flags any potential consideration within a given area and does not ascribe these to being positive or negative. Users must, instead, apply technical expertise and local knowledge to determine whether the flagged considerations require further investigation."

            "text": "Assessing suitability for beavers In addition to highlighting considerations that beaver activity might affect, the BCAT incorporates two key data layers to explore habitat suitability: the Beaver Dam Capacity (BDC) and the Beaver Foraging Index (BFI) layers (Graham et al. 2020). These layers can be used to assess the likelihood of dam construction and the distribution of predicted habitat suitability in river reaches, in terms of foraging including broadleaved woodland and other sources of forage. "

        {
            "text": "For any custom-drawn area, the BCAT provides a pie chart summary of the likelihood of damming and the suitability for foraging (Figure 2). Understanding the suitability of foraging habitat and the likelihood of dam-building is crucial for identifying areas where beavers are likely to settle and where their activities might have an effect."
