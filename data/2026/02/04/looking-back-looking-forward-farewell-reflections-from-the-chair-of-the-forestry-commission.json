We manage the nation\u2019s forests, protect and expand England\u2019s woodlands, and work with landowners, communities and partners to ensure trees and forests thrive. It is work that touches every part of the country and every aspect of our lives."

They lock in carbon, provide timber for our homes, create habitats for wildlife, and offer spaces for people to connect with nature. The Forestry Commission has a unique role in shaping all of this, balancing environmental, economic, and social needs, whilst meeting our important regulatory and legal duties."

New leadership has made us more resilient for the future and we are now more visible, playing a central role in influencing forestry policy and leading delivery across England."

Public awareness and engagement have grown, and forestry is now firmly on the national agenda."
