When buyers can choose between suppliers, they can find products better suited to their needs and this process rewards those suppliers with better, cheaper or more innovative products than their rivals.

The UK is one of the better performers in this area, but any new policy could harm competition and decision-makers need an honest assessment of the competitive effects, and potential alternatives."

Entrants are often the source of \u2018disruptive innovation\u2019 as noted in the OECD's policy paper on disruptive innovations and their effect on competition. Challengers with new ways of doing things, such as ride-hailing apps like Uber and Bolt, came from apparently nowhere to overturn industry norms. Regulations can be particularly harmful to such radical entrants, if they entrench existing standards, or specify particular ways of doing things."

Advertising bans make it harder for new entrants to inform consumers and thus displace rivals. This was a concern examined by the Department of Health and Social Care in the impact assessment for its policy to restrict advertising of high fat, salt and sugar products to children."

So will standards that are already met by existing firms. Studies have shown that larger firms are more likely to lobby for regulations imposing costs or standards on their industry, as they fully understand these help preserve their positions. "

Does the policy objective really need to be achieved in this manner or are there more pro-competitive alternative ways of intervening? OECD and CMA guidelines provide examples.

For example by identifying data sources that could be used to evaluate entry and exit, or the dynamics of prices, especially if the before-and-after effects of the intervention can be compared to an unaffected industry or region. Again, if the regulation turns out to be harming competition, policymakers will need to understand why, to redesign it to mitigate this effect."
