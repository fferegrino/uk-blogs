This is a bold claim but one that many people, working in partnership, are trying to make a reality. The Lower Thames Crossing project will connect Kent and Essex through two 2.6 mile long tunnels beneath the Thames and is designed to alleviate pressure on the Dartford Crossing."

            "text": "A project of this scale gives us an exciting opportunity to build in nature from the very start, not as an afterthought. Because the truth is, nature and growth aren't in competition. When we get this right, congestion will be cut, boosting the economy, and leaving the environment in a better state than we found it."

            "text": "In July 2025 Natural England was appointed by government as the Lead Environmental Regulator for the Lower Thames Crossing, making the project the first pilot to test this model. What does this mean in practice? Instead of developers going back and forth between different regulators, they'll have one front door on areas of advice that overlap. That means faster decisions, more streamlined processes, and more certainty for everyone involved. "

            "text": "As the Lead Environmental Regulator, Natural England\u2019s focus has been to coordinate input from various regulators, reduce duplication, streamline processes and ensure clear communication, all while working within existing legislative frameworks. Collaboration is therefore key and recently I had the opportunity to get on site with partners from the Lower Thames Crossing, National Highways, the Marine Management Organisation and the Environment Agency to hear more about this pioneering project."

            "text": "Recovering nature is core to Natural England\u2019s recently launched strategy, and it was inspiring to visit the site for the early wetland mitigation works at the historic Coalhouse Point. The area was once marshland but was enclosed by a sea wall and farmed. Before construction of the road and tunnels can begin, Coalhouse Point must be up and running as a wetland habitat for birds and climate resilience. Once functioning, this will support a wide range of bird species such as black-tailed godwit, avocet, ringed plover and lapwing. The great news is this vital wetland habitat creation is on track to be delivered on time, thanks to the close partnership working facilitated by the Lead Regulator."

        {
            "text": "But that\u2019s not the only environmental benefit to come from this project; it also plans to reuse material generated by the construction, such as chalk tunnel spoil. This spoil will be used to create habitats that safeguard rare and threatened brownfield invertebrates such as the shrill carder bee, as many invertebrates bury into this type of material as part of their lifecycle."

            "text": "The Lower Thames Crossing team also hope to create seven green bridges of varying sizes and functions. A green bridge is a vegetated structure built over a road to let wildlife safely cross, connect fragmented habitats and reduce animal-vehicle collisions, whilst also providing connection for people and traffic. Natural England is working with the partnership to ensure the green bridges meet the needs of people, nature, traffic and the wider landscape. The green bridges offer the potential to reconnect nature rich sites previously fragmented by existing roads, providing great opportunities for people to connect these sites. Projects like the Lower Thames Crossing and other major infrastructure are catalysts for change and provide the opportunity to support nature\u2019s recovery at a landscape scale."

            "text": "This type of nature recovery and environmental benefit cannot be achieved by working in isolation, and it was clear from the site meeting that the Lead Environmental Regulator model is trailblazing a new way to expedite nature recovery while accelerating development. For example, coordinating the permissions required to deliver the early wetland mitigation works at Coalhouse Point involved engaging early and openly to build shared understanding and trust, and working closely with other regulatory bodies to ensure a unified, outcome-focused approach."

During the visit, I was happy to see how well this partnership is working."

Necessary regulatory processes have been streamlined. For example, the time needed to amend a legal requirement was significantly reduced (achieved in record time) - helping to reduce project risk, practical solutions were sought to protect species whilst supporting the project timeline and delays were prevented by collaborating on protective provisions applications."
