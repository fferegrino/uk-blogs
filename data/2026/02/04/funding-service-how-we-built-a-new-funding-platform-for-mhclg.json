            "text": "We thought long and hard about writing a new platform versus making  incremental improvements to our previous microservices. This is not a  decision to take lightly as it involves a major upfront commitment and is often regarded a last resort once other re-engineering options have been considered."

        {
            "text": "Whilst this delivered some initial benefits, for example being able to speed up time to go-live by using existing capabilities and components from the XGov Form Builder as part of the system, there were many downsides caused by early design decisions:"
        },
        {
            "text": "We realised what we had built was closer to a Distributed Monolith. We had all the pain of maintaining microservices without many of the benefits."
        },
        {
            "text": "These issues impacted all our user groups in different ways, grant applicants and recipients were more likely to experience errors and outages, it was difficult for developers to work at pace (without impacting quality) and  feature development was slow for our product and service owners."
        },
        {
            "text": "Another factor in play was a pivot in policy through government\u2019s commitment to simplify funding, moving away from competitive grants towards allocative grants, which required different capabilities. This meant some of what the previous microservices did would be less useful and new capabilities were needed, making it an opportune moment for change."

This was much higher fidelity than you might ordinarily build using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. But taking this approach enabled us to prove and demonstrate high-level  hypotheses the team had, including:"

        {
            "text": "Following a really intense effort by the team, by the end of the fortnight we had a prototype with a real data model, database backend and full WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) preview capabilities. This felt like a huge step up from the status quo and the demo was enough to convince stakeholders including our product manager and service owner of the value of the project."

            "text": "Although 'Deliver' and 'Access' appear as separate services, they are essentially 2 sides of the same coin, a form building/CMS side and an applicant/recipient-facing side. Working in a single codebase and database made it much easier to deliver features like WYSIWYG preview, as they are essentially just different views on the same data."
        },
        {
            "text": "Furthermore, having these self-service capabilities means that content  designers can design, share live previews with policy teams and launch a  whole grant without any developer involvement. This will be hugely beneficial in freeing up developers to work on new functionality, rather than doing grant configuration as code."

            "text": "As I move on to an equally exciting digital programme within MHCLG (Elections Digital), I'm proud to have left our civil servant-led team working in the open with (after a few iterations) a simple, right-sized architecture which enables them to build out features at pace, empower colleagues with self-service capabilities, and a platform to continue to extend across the funding lifecycle."
