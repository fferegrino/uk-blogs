        },
        {
            "text": "Apply too little and crops won\u2019t reach their potential. Apply too much and fertiliser, slurry and other organic materials are wasted, costs rise, and the risk of nutrients running into rivers and streams increases."

            "text": "By following the recommendations, you can reduce over-application, cut waste and make sure every bag of fertiliser or load of slurry contributes to crop growth."

            "text": "Because it\u2019s online, there\u2019s nothing to install. Once you\u2019ve set up your farm and fields and entered your soil type and soil analysis, the tool can pull in local data from your postcode automatically, including rainfall and altitude. You can also adjust the rainfall figure if needed."
        },
        {
            "text": "It then guides you to nutrient recommendations across a wide range of crops, including arable, grassland, horticulture and permanent crops, and it can be used for organic and regenerative systems too."
