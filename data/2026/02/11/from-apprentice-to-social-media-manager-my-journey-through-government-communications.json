I spent a\u00a0couple of\u00a0years\u00a0in primary schools\u00a0training to be a teaching assistant after I finished sixth form, then\u00a0I did a brief stint\u00a0as an apprentice in journalism, having thought the move from teaching assistant may push me further and give me a challenge.\u00a0Fundamentally though, it\u00a0wasn\u2019t\u00a0for me, I\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0feel like I was making a difference the way I did in schools. I looked for another opportunity, something that was\u00a0still\u00a0a \u2018learn as you earn\u2019 role, making an impact\u00a0and\u00a0progressing my career.\u00a0"

Fresh-faced\u00a0to Government\u00a0and eager to learn, I threw myself into\u00a0my first placement in\u00a0social media, discovering a genuine passion for connecting with the public through digital channels, ensuring people\u00a0were\u00a0aware and involved.\u00a0\u00a0"

Suddenly, I found myself at the heart of\u00a0HMRC\u2019s\u00a0crisis communications\u00a0team\u00a0during one of the most challenging\u00a0global\u00a0periods in recent history. Those months working on COVID messaging taught me more than any textbook ever could. Helping people understand vital schemes like furlough, when their livelihoods depended on clear,\u00a0accurate\u00a0information, showed me the real impact government communications can have on people's lives. I completed my Level 4 qualification in PR during this time, which gave me a\u00a0strong\u00a0professional foundation to build on.\u00a0"

This was\u00a0an entirely different role within communications.\u00a0\u00a0Writing press releases, coordinating campaigns with influencers, and yes, working those memorable night shifts. Working\u00a0directly to\u00a0the Home Secretary brought a level of pressure\u00a0I\u00a0hadn't\u00a0experienced before, but it taught me to think on my feet and stay calm when the stakes were high. Every challenging moment was a learning opportunity. I was involved in many\u00a0life\u00a0changing campaigns \u2013\u00a0from drink spiking\u00a0to knife crime and police recruitment, every word on every release mattered.\u00a0"
