His appraisal of the Environment Agency however was not positive. He cited\u00a0needing many permits from several organisations with quite a few of them being from the EA, which he felt would take years, and the idea of restoration would be over before it began. It was a story of great people, but terrible anti-growth and anti-nature processes.\u00a0"
