            "text": "This isn't about opposing regulation. Businesses understand that well-designed rules protect workers, consumers, and fair competition.

When business leaders across every sector unite behind this principle, it reflects a shared understanding: good evidence makes better regulation, and better regulation supports sustainable growth."
