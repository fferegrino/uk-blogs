It is also important that we consider the need to halt and reverse the decline in marine biodiversity and enable nature\u2019s recovery alongside the government\u2019s priority to expand the UK\u2019s renewable energy network."

Seabird collision with offshore wind infrastructure remains one such major consenting issue, partly due to the lack of accurate, high-quality data on seabird flight height and uncertainty surrounding the interaction of seabirds with wind turbines."

Twenty surveys are planned to take place across key sites for seabirds in UK waters between September 2025 and August 2026. "

This study was carried out in August 2024 by the ReSCUE team, supported by members of the NE Birds team, Earth Observations team, and the BTO. "

In combination with a gap analysis, and input from stakeholders, the results of this study were used to inform the final scope and design of the 12-month LiDAR-digital aerial survey campaign, to ensure it is fit for purpose and delivers value for money."

The project will deliver a user-friendly toolkit to facilitate access to, and use of, the outputs, which will also include clear recommendations for data collection, processing, analysis, and practical application of resulting evidence."
