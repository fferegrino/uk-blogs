Independent assessments of socioeconomic benefits and risks are underway, and the plan is expected later this year."

Beavers are a flagship example of the wider species recovery and reintroduction ambition set out in the Environment Plan 2025 - demonstrating how carefully planned, collaborative action can help revive degraded landscapes, boost biodiversity and create healthier, more climate resilient places for people and wildlife alike. And species recovery builds upon a growing network of ambitious landscape-scale nature recovery projects and initiatives, working with partners and communities to restore habitats and ecosystems across the country."
