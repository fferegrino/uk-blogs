When I visited, teenagers were relaxed, chatting and laughing as they rode their bikes to school by themselves. Moments like that show what good public investment can achieve: fun, safe routes, greener journeys and healthier lives. Creating spaces where people feel safe to move and connect is why I do the job \u2013 and why I'm proud to do it."

But the real moment it clicks is when the paperwork fades and the impact comes into focus. A strategy I helped shape isn't just a document \u2013 it means a safer home for a family, a better classroom for a child, or a modern hospital for a patient.\u00a0"
