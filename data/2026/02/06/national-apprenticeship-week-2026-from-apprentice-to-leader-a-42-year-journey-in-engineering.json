            "text": "I remember starting my apprenticeship at the Royal Naval Aircraft Yard Fleetlands as if it was yesterday, surprising now that I'm almost 42 years into my career. As a 16-year-old with imposter syndrome daunted by my peer group, overwhelmed by the types of aircraft that I was expected to work on and understand in detail, I would never have guessed that I would have travelled the world. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d work with such amazing people, experience incredible moments that remain unforgettable. Then within Defence, be responsible, as a Project Manager then a Chief Engineer, and latterly Deputy Head for the DE&S Airworthiness Team. When I look at my peer group now, all of whom are successful professionals, my reflection on the training we received as young adults is that it not only taught the basics (the how) but taught us to really understand 'the why'. Of course, all apprenticeships teach you that, but it's not until later in life when you appreciate that trained inquisitiveness becomes your superpower when looking for better outcomes or improvements to products and services."

As one of many mentors within our department, I volunteer to support the Engineering Apprentice and Graduate programmes, with the aim of helping them gain not just the developmental opportunities for becoming the future Chief Engineers but understanding why we do the things we do. And of course, hopefully some of those exciting, \u2018money can\u2019t buy\u2019 experiences that only Defence can offer."

Helping colleagues where I can, demystify requirements to determine intent, challenge when appropriate, simplify and mature activity to make work achievable, all whilst continuing to learn, are things that fortunately for myself come relatively naturally. If you\u2019re starting your career or thinking about mentoring, take that step - you never know where it might lead. When does that apprenticeship stop; possibly never, that\u2019s the fun part. What would be really fun is to go back to my roots, get my overalls on then go and get my hands dirty, I miss that!"
