The virus is mostly spread person to person but can also be spread by contaminated food or water. It is possible to catch norovirus more than once within a short period, as multiple strains circulate at any given time. The incubation period, which is the time between catching an illness and showing symptoms, is typically 12 to 48 hours. Most people recover after a few days\u2019 rest, but vulnerable groups are at risk of complications including dehydration, which can cause hospitalisation."

It does not follow a seasonal pattern and infections may occur at any time of year. Although most common in infants and young children, individuals of any age may be affected. Symptoms are generally mild, though infections can prove more severe in those with weakened immune systems."

You typically catch the infection from raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk, or untreated water. Poor hygiene during food preparation can cause it to spread through cross-contamination, and it is also passed on through contact with an infected animal or its environment, for example pets suffering from diarrhoea. The incubation period is generally 2 to 5 days."

Transmission occurs through contact with contaminated poo, either directly from person to person, or indirectly through contaminated food, water or surfaces. Travellers to regions with inadequate sanitation face particular risk, although it is present in the UK. Globally, most cases of shigellosis are in children younger than 5 years of age, but all ages can be affected. There is also a risk of Shigella transmission through sexual contact, which is more likely among men who have sex with men.\u00a0"

Common food sources may include undercooked minced beef, unpasteurised milk and dairy products, and raw leafy greens."

Children under 5 years are particularly susceptible, with infections often associated with animal contact at petting farms or lambing events."
