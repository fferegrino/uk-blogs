We\u2019ve welcomed a group of enthusiastic students, aged 17 to 19, into our Digital, Data, Technology and Security team, and given them hands on experience of real projects that support Defra\u2019s mission and wider government priorities. It\u2019s been great to see them explore, contribute and grow. "

Their placement will finish with a challenge: designing a digital service that allows users to apply for a wind turbine grant. It\u2019s an ambitious brief, but they\u2019ve already shown they\u2019re more than up to it.This pilot is a brilliant way to showcase the breadth of digital roles within Defra, and to help young people understand the technologies and approaches we use every day. Our hope is that we\u2019re not only giving them valuable experience \u2013 we\u2019re also inspiring them to consider careers in the Civil Service.We are passionate about making Defra a diverse, inclusive, and supportive place to work. Through this pilot, we\u2019ve offered opportunities to students from a range of backgrounds, helping them feel welcome, valued and hopefully more confident about their futures. Many have told us that the experience has helped challenge the idea that the Civil Service isn\u2019t for \u201cpeople like them\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s something we hope we can help change for good through this programme."

By working together, we\u2019re helping bridge the gap between classroom learning and real world digital delivery. At a time when many young people are navigating a competitive jobs market and have reduced access to early career opportunities, programmes like this are really important, and it\u2019s something we will look to repeat given the success we\u2019ve had with this pilot.
