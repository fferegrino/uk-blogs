A more streamlined approach can maintain high quality and reinforce confidence that apprentices are fully occupationally competent."

            "text": "The reforms give us the flexibility to make these improvements \u2013 but assessment cannot be designed to a one-size-fits-all approach. Apprenticeships span very different occupations, levels of risk and professional expectations. What works for one standard will not work for all."
