Alongside research, horizon scanning and performance monitoring, our user support channel helps us to understand a wide range of current and future needs."

            "text": "User support is done in-house by the team that builds and runs Notify. We have a rota in place where developers, front-end developers and site reliability engineers handle technical queries, while user-centred designers, product managers and delivery managers answer non-technical questions."

        {
            "text": "User support has played a key role in scaling Notify. For example, when we first let users choose their own email branding, they had to ask us to set it up for them. Having early adopters contact support to do this was a good way to learn about their needs."
        },
        {
            "text": "As our user base grew, so did the burden on support. At one point, branding requests made up nearly 10% of all support tickets. After learning enough from our users, we were able to design and build a new feature that made the whole process self-service, so users no longer had to contact us. These days, support tickets related to branding make up less than 1% of all tickets."
        },
        {
            "text": "We call this approach our \u2018maturity model\u2019. The minimum viable product (MVP) for new features (almost) always relies on user support. This means we can launch the MVP quickly, learn how people are using it, and iterate as we go. Once we\u2019re confident that a feature will provide value to users and that we can support it technically, we consider how we can make it self-service."
        },
        {
            "text": "Our maturity model means every new feature will generate quite a few support tickets. Instead of a burden, we see this as a necessary part of building a sustainable, user-centred service."

Understanding our users\u2019 biggest problems helps us all to empathise with them, uncover root cause issues, and stay connected to the impact of our work. Additionally, users receive a personal response to a potentially complex problem, while the team gets valuable exposure to parts of the service they have less experience with."

We crowdsource answers to tricky questions, co-own a support manual that addresses common queries, and keep a wiki to pool technical knowledge."
        },
        {
            "text": "This does have its challenges. On average, we respond to 33 tickets a day \u2013 including tickets that are necessary to complete a user\u2019s journey, such as asking to make their service live. This can be time-consuming, but we\u2019re constantly refining how we manage support, and understand that making it a visible, planned part of our work gives the team space to do it well."

We use topic tags to enable a systematic analysis process that measures the frequency of categorised issues and ticket volumes. We visualise this in a dashboard that\u2019s used to identify the biggest issues each quarter. Alongside other data sources, these insights inform our quarterly planning, helping to shape priorities across the team."

        {
            "text": "We often design tactical solutions first. For example, writing a stock answer that explains the solution to a common question. If the same issue comes up a lot, we have to determine if it is worth dedicating resources to designing a more effective solution. We might run design workshops where we consider changing our guidance, redesigning the user interface, introducing new features or even changing our policies and processes to address the root-cause of a problem."

        {
            "text": "One example of this is the work we\u2019re currently doing to improve Notify\u2019s onboarding journey. By analysing topic tags, we identified that a lot of users experience pain because they miss out on some important information when they first create a Notify service. We divided the work into focused, manageable initiatives, each designed to deliver a clear, measurable impact \u2013 using support tickets as one of the metrics."

        {
            "text": "Alongside measuring the response to specific features, we can also assess how our overall volumes of support tickets are changing as we scale. Notify has grown to support over 11,000 services over the past year, yet ticket volumes remain steady, even showing slight decreases. This is a positive sign for us that, while Notify is growing, user friction is staying low."
