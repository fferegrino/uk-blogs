Through many conversations with my grandad about women in engineering during World War II, I decided I wanted to take the apprenticeship path towards becoming an engineer. I chose to study Maths and Physics at A Level, during which I spoke with my tutor about apprenticeships and they recommended the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) for me to apply to become an engineering apprentice."

This taught me the essential practical skills and knowledge for working in the manufacturing workshop at NPL, where I spent the remaining three years of my apprenticeship, with one day a week at college for the Level 3 and 4 qualifications."

They have been encouraging throughout my apprenticeship as I have balanced studying my qualifications and training on the machines, ensuring I have the flexibility to achieve in both areas. At first, I started on the manual mills and lathes, machining components for the scientists within NPL. Then, I completed six weeks in the Design Office, where I learnt how to use SolidWorks, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software used for creating solid models, technical drawings and assemblies. This was essential in strengthening my skill of interpreting engineering drawings and allows me to communicate with design engineers and customers about the specifications for components."

            "text": "In my third year, I moved to working on Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machines, learning how to program more complex components. Initially, I programmed on the machine using Siemens control, the programming language used by the XYZ 560 machine. As I progressed, I began using Fusion360, a Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) software. This software could be for any machine in the workshop so I am able to continue producing components without much disruption. During my studies, NPL have given me the opportunity to work within different teams, ensuring I can develop a broad skillset in many facets of engineering, allowing me to become a well-rounded individual."
