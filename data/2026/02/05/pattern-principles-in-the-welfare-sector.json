Patterns at each level support and enable patterns at other levels. Taking a life event approach shapes what services are needed, which determines the sequences required, which then defines the components to be built. But it also works in reverse: component patterns enable sequence patterns. Sequences combine into services. Services form a seamless and coordinated journey around life events."
