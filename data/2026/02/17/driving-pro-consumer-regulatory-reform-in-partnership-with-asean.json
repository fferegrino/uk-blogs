The research reviews current challenges, the  role of consumer organisations, issues in e-commerce and offers tailored recommendations to empower consumers and build safer markets. This work is informing the design, implementation, and evaluation of reforms that put consumers first. This has also guided the development of a Philippines specific implementation toolkit, to support translating these recommendations into practical action."

This research focused on the Philippines as according to the ASEAN Consumer Empowerment Index (ACEI) 2020, consumer awareness and access to redress mechanisms in the country remain moderate. As the Filipino government expressed a desire to better engage with consumer organisations and to improve consumer empowerment scores, this research aims to strengthen consumer protection in the Philippines."
