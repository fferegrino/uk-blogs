            "text": "The generosity of Britain's faith communities is extraordinary. Every year, millions of pounds are donated during Ramadan \u2013 a remarkable contribution that speaks to the deep-rooted traditions of zakat and sadaqah, and to the commitment of millions of people to help those in need."

            "text": "This generosity should be celebrated by everyone, as it provides a genuine lifeline to people facing hardship, supporting charities that work locally, nationally and overseas. As I heard vividly at the Muslim Charities Convention last summer, money raised during Ramadan funds food banks, supports refugees, provides clean water, and sustains countless other vital causes. It represents something profoundly good about our society."

            "text": "But we know that criminals and fraudsters try to take advantage of times of increased giving, so we all need to be vigilant. They set up fake charities, create convincing but fraudulent websites, and send messages designed to divert your generosity into their own pockets."

            "text": "This isn't about casting suspicion on donors or on the thousands of wonderful, genuine charities serving communities. It's about making sure that when you give \u2013 with the sincere intention of helping others \u2013 your money actually reaches those you want to help."

            "text": "That's why we are working closely with the Muslim Charities Forum and the Fundraising Regulator to raise awareness of this risk and how to avoid being caught out. Together, we want to ensure that the incredible generosity shown during religious seasons has the greatest possible impact."

            "text": "As Fadi Itani, CEO of the Muslim Charities Forum says, \u201cBritish Muslims give generously throughout the year, especially during the month of Ramadan, to UK and international causes. Giving intentionally helps maximise spiritual reward and ensure donations make the greatest impact. Checking a charity\u2019s registration and how you donate helps support genuine, effective organisations.\u201d"
