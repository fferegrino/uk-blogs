People naturally prefer what they are used to, and\u00a0a constant influx of new tools and processes can leave teams feeling\u00a0overwhelmed.\u00a0That's\u00a0why empowering users to use different software and adopt\u00a0new\u00a0products and software\u00a0can be a challenge. It is as much about managing human emotions as it is about implementing new tools.\u00a0"
