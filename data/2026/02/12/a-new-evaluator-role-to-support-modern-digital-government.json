            "text": "As the UK Government embarks on ambitious digital transformation initiatives as set out in the Blueprint for Modern Digital Government, we need robust evaluation mechanisms in place to ensure accountability and demonstrate value for public money. The Performance Review of Digital Spend by HM Treasury and the Department for Science and Innovation (DSIT) has shown that the way digital projects are funded, managed, and monitored needs to change."

            "text": "In response, the Government Digital and Data profession has recently introduced a new digital evaluator role in the capability framework. It draws on the experience of our team at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). Digital evaluators are embedded in agile teams, supporting products through continuous learning. They assess digital products and services for their impact on society, how efficient they are, and any unexpected results."

            "text": "Digital teams provide one of the most rewarding environments for evaluators. They actively welcome insights and feedback to support continuous improvement, as this is part of the ethos of agile working. They are also very supportive of iterative learning as a necessary step in supporting continuous innovation and ideas. It enables the release of resources to move on to new, hopefully better, projects that best meet the needs of users and provide value for money."

Their insights help teams \"test, learn, adapt,\" providing clear pointers for decision-making and ensuring accountability and learning across the wider team. Ultimately their expertise ensures that digital products and services are continuously improving, securing benefits to end users of government services and providing value for money. Digital evaluations ensure that digital products and services are aligned with best practices in spending public money."

These include process evaluation, impact and economic evaluation methods and a range of quantitative and qualitative research techniques. They also understand the principles of the HMT Green Book and how to measure value for money. This comprehensive approach not only ensures that digital products and services are thoroughly evaluated to understand what works, what doesn\u2019t and why. It also looks at their social impact, efficiency gains, and potential unintended consequences."

            "text": "Traditional evaluators typically operate outside the program area to secure an objective assessment, and government evaluations are often commissioned to the private sector to deliver. Their methods focus on long-term outcomes after implementation, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of interventions over time.\u00a0In contrast, digital evaluators are agile and hands-on, starting their evaluation in the Discovery or Alpha stages and ensuring the evaluation is continuous and dynamic. They develop evaluation plans in-house and have hands-on experience of applied evaluation methodologies. Digital evaluation is more akin to action evaluation, because digital services are developed in an iterative way, so traditional methods are not always applicable or effective. In digital, evaluation is a crucial role to secure continuous improvement."

By continuously feeding insights into the development process, digital evaluators ensure that digital products and services deliver value for the public and society.\u00a0"
