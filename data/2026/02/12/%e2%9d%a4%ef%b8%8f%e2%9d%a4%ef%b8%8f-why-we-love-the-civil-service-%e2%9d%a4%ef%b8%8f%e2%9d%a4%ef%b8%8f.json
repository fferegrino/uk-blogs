My proudest moment was creating what colleagues nicknamed \u201cThe Elephant Chart\u201d - a visual that transformed complex data into something everyone could instantly understand. It became the go-to way to track progress at a glance. I must also mention my mentor Amy who changed everything by helping me see opportunities instead of obstacles. Amy pushed me beyond my comfort zone. Her faith in me, reshaped how I approach challenges and my whole career."

We\u2019ve been through so much together that it honestly deserves its own Valentine\u2019s card!"
