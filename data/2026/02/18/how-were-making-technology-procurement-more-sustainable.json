This is the contract that provides laptops, phones, and tablets to colleagues. We are the first government department to adopt refurbished and remanufactured laptops at scale as part of a broader commitment to more sustainable technology use."

The parts have been broken down to their individual components and rebuilt back to the manufacturer\u2019s specification using both old and new parts. Refurbished devices are those that have had mostly cosmetic changes, bringing the device back to looking like new."
