            "text": "England\u2019s lowland peatlands, including the Cambridgeshire Fens, Somerset Levels and Lancashire Mosses, cover around 250,000 hectares, roughly the size of Dorset. These landscapes have supported some of the country\u2019s most productive farmland for generations."

        {
            "text": "Since the 1600s, much of this land has been drained for agriculture. That drainage has brought benefits for production, but it has also caused these carbon-rich soils to erode and the land to sink, making it harder to keep farming these areas in the same way over the long term."

            "text": "Peat soils are naturally fertile and an important carbon store. But when soils are drained, the organic matter breaks down, releasing carbon into the atmosphere. The soil compacts, the surface level drops, and the peat layer thins."
        },
        {
            "text": "As land subsides, ditches and drains often need more maintenance, pumping can become more important, and water levels can be harder to control. That can mean higher operating costs and greater vulnerability in both wet and dry periods."
