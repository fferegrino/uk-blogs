Yet there was one thing they all had in common \u2013 innovation. The entrepreneurs were all striving to build and improve on existing products, through innovative modifications and concepts."

A clever play on the word \u2018glamping\u2019 and \u2018awning\u2019, James was showcasing his teepee style canvas awning that attaches to motorhomes, caravans and the like."

            "text": "I was keen to see if James had protected this unique business name and after using IPO\u2019s \u2018search for a trade mark\u2019 tool, I was pleased to see he has a registered trade mark for the word \u2018glawning\u2019 under classes 20 and 22, which relate to camping."

Upon hearing the words \u2018patent\u2019 and \u2018design\u2019 in the same sentence, Deborah Meaden seeks to clarify what protection James has applied for, \u2018Is that a patent or a design patent?\u2019"

            "text": "A design patent is a US term, not legally recognised in the UK, and is used to protect the aesthetic appearance of something. It is very different from a UK patent, which protects the technical aspect of an invention and is notoriously difficult to obtain."

            "text": "Did you know, intellectual property (IP) can be one of your business\u2019 most valuable assets and should be considered in the same way as your physical assets? Having IP protection in place can make you more desirable to investors and can be used to secure funding, so it's important you know the value of your trade mark, patent or design. An IP professional or accountant can help you with this, and our guidance details more about getting professional IP help."

            "text": "One thing I noted from tonight\u2019s episode was a lot of talk surrounding the involvement of other parties in the various businesses, in particular Club Cultured and Kibu. While the Dragons were concerned that more people meant diluted shares/profit, I was looking at the businesses with my intellectual property hat on. I hoped the inventors had the right agreements in place to determine who owns what with regards to the IP. \u00a0\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Often, many people end up involved in creating intellectual property because modern ideas rarely come from a single mind working in isolation. Businesses rely on teams of designers, engineers, researchers, and partners who each contribute something unique, which means ownership can quickly become complicated if it isn't clearly defined."
