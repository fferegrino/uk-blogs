Getting it right protects public trust and ensures charities can continue to attract the financial support they need to make their desired impact."

However, our 2025 public research indicates the proportion of people donating or raising funds for charities has fallen in the previous five years. As a result, charities may find they need to work harder to attract and retain financial support from the public."

            "text": "One way of reassuring donors is to fully comply with the law on fundraising and follow best practice, which charities can do by registering with the Fundraising Regulator and following its now well-established Code of Fundraising Practice. Our refreshed guidance complements the Code, which was updated in November, to help trustees better understand their legal duties and responsibilities in this important area."

At the same time, the new fundraising guidance explains how trustees\u2019 management of fundraising should dovetail with how they minimise fraud at their charity and manage other risks."

            "text": "Our revised CC40 emergency appeals guidance, meanwhile, recognises the essential role that charities play in emergency situations. Aid charities raising money to carry out expert humanitarian work worldwide is a clear example. But emergencies happen closer to home too, where charities and other agencies work together to meet immediate and longer-term needs of communities in the UK. The Southport Stronger Together Appeal is a recent example, supporting those affected by the shocking knife attack which took place in that community in 2024. "

            "text": "It is understandable to want to set up an appeal in the face of a crisis, disaster or other emergency. And it is easy to do this using online giving platforms.
