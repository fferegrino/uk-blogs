With the research on seabirds, we hope to incorporate their observed location and behaviours into the upcoming species conservation plan as well as the OECM. This is also the first time we are collecting data on our deep sea snapper species, which will help us make informed decisions on the future sustainable management of the fisheries. For nutrients and pollutants, this will feed directly into the future water quality strategy planning. This expedition will provide a unique opportunity for us to collect vital baseline data from the Cayman Islands vast and difficult to access offshore areas."
