            "text": "In addition to the physical properties of trees, your tree\u2019s intended end use will also be decided by available local markets. Unprocessed timber is a bulky material and can be costly to transport. Therefore, most markets are based around wood processors who are set up to use local wood resources."

            "text": "Coppicing is a traditional way to manage broadleaf woodland in England and can really benefit wildlife. Species such as hazel, oak, willow and sweet chestnut can be repeatedly cut back to their base when dormant, to encourage the regrowth of multiple straight stems. This can be done on rotation every 7 to 20 years. We will explore some common, large-scale markets which coppice products can be readily sold into."

            "text": "Hazel coppice for example, is ideal for managing on short 7 to 12-year rotations, producing lots of long, thin poles that are suitable for things like thatching spars, woven hurdles and stakes and binders for hedging. All these uses are due to the pliability of hazel and its ability to be woven and twisted into place."
        },
        {
            "text": "When hazel coppice is harvested, each stem is visually graded and cut to length to suit their intended end use. Hedging stakes can be shorter, and thick stakes used to form a physical barrier in hedgerows around which the pleachers (the living, cut and bent stems of a hedge woven together for hedgelaying) can be laid."
        },
        {
            "text": "Stakes can be cut from the base of a coppice pole and can utilise shorter clean lengths. Binders are long, thin, flexible stems, somewhere between an inch and two inches in diameter at their base. Binders are typically used more regionally to weave along the top of a laid hedge to hold down the pleachers and provide strength to the hedge."

For softwood posts, the ability to be treated to increase its life span is also important."

            "text": "Durability is another important wood property to consider. Some tree species are naturally more durable than others. Species like oak, sweet chestnut and some \u2018redwood\u2019 conifers such as larch are naturally long-lasting. They are suitable for outside use without the need for treatment to protect them from rot. However, many softwood species such as spruce will require treatment."

            "text": "Another property of hardwood species, such as oak and sweet chestnut, is their ability to be split along the grain to make strong, hard-wearing rails which do not require sawing. This is a trait which can be harnessed to make strong, long-lasting post and rail fences."
