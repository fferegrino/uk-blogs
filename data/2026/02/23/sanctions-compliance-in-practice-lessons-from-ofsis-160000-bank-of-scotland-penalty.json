OFSI\u2019s published outcomes demonstrate how OFSI assesses breaches, the circumstances surrounding them, and how weaknesses in screening, escalation and training are taken into account when breaches have occurred. These lessons can help firms better understand how to run sanctions controls in practice, and how weaknesses in screening, escalation and training can expose firms to the risk of breaching."
