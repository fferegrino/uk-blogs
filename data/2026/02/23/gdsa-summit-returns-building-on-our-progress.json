It\u2019s transitioned from a group of 40 government suppliers to a blossoming and bustling community of digital sustainability experts, representing more than 94 organisations from industry, academia and the third sector.\u00a0"

We\u2019ve been able to weave this knowledge into strategy documents, guidance and policy to set out how and why sustainability should be embedded into government digital services. This will help to ensure efficiency and resilience alongside environmental and social benefits."
