They present new evidence on trawling gear - seabed interaction, suggesting that emissions released from trawling, while still significant, are likely lower than previously estimated. The authors also highlight uncertainties linking carbon disturbance from various human activities, carbon reactivity and actual emissions. The findings have highlighted potential trade-offs for management options supporting environmental, clean energy, and food security goals and paves the way for cross sector collaboration and consensus."
