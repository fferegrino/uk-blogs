Bringing together communications experts from across the space sector,\u00a0we wanted to\u00a0move the conversation about space communications from\u00a0talking about\u00a0the challenges to taking meaningful action.\u00a0"

Satellite services alone underpin activities worth \u00a3454 billion - an astonishing 18% of the UK\u2019s GDP. Yet, despite this significance, misconceptions about space careers and the sector\u2019s role in everyday life persist. Our workshop set out to address these communication gaps and find new ways to tell the story of space in the UK and beyond.\u00a0"

It's not enough to talk about astronauts and rocket launches; we must also showcase\u00a0the full spectrum of opportunities, from\u00a0graphic design\u00a0to the development of applications and services that touch every aspect of modern life.\u00a0"

By\u00a0leveraging\u00a0high-profile influencers and educators, we can reach young audiences in a relatable way. We also recognised the importance of \u201cgetting on the ground\u201d to understand what\u00a0truly excites\u00a0young people, using research that leads to actionable outcomes. Industry placements and internship programmes were highlighted as powerful tools to make space careers both accessible and exciting.\u00a0"
