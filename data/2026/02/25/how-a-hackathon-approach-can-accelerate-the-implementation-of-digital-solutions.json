Our \u00a0aim was to provide a creative environment to explore automation in environmental reporting."

In future hackathons we would plan those activities in advance as they proved valuable in delivering insight and opportunities to discuss the business side of the problems we were exploring. \u00a0Those activities included; agreeing a North Star; working through and creating an initial draft of our minimum viable product (MVP) that could be revisited and refined during alpha; identification of wider opportunities; and a session working through the business or operational problems that needed addressing. \u00a0"

It demonstrated what\u2019s possible when government teams and industry partners collaborate to solve real-world problems."
