After a 4-year\u00a0long\u00a0career\u00a0in distribution I was inspired by my girlfriend,\u00a0who was making a daily impact with her role in science,\u00a0to take up something new\u00a0\u2013 a step back into\u00a0academia.\u00a0"

Initially I thought that I had nowhere near enough experience to take on something like this, but as it turns out an apprenticeship was the perfect path to take.\u00a0"

I was incredibly excited at the prospect of contributing to such innovative and futuristic technology at such an early point in my apprenticeship; the opportunities only came flooding\u00a0in from that point\u00a0onwards. I\u00a0was responsible for\u00a0numerous\u00a0computer-aided design and technical specification assets for an exciting space-level project putting us one step closer to space-age atomic clocks. I was so shocked at how much I was contributing to such an important development in science.\u00a0"
