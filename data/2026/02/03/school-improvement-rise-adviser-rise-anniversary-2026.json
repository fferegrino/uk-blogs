            "text": "After years as a headteacher, trust leader, and adviser, I've learned one thing with certainty: every school has something exceptional going on. Sometimes it's celebrated, sometimes it's fragile and held together by a small group working against the odds. But it's always there."
        },
        {
            "text": "Too often, improvement work overlooks this, focusing on gaps rather than strengths. I've also seen how easily improvement becomes about more initiatives and more expectations. This leaves leaders managing complexity rather than thinking clearly about what matters most for children."

            "text": "RISE felt different. It offered the chance to work\u00a0with\u00a0leaders, not\u00a0on\u00a0schools, through a universal offer that values where schools are now. The emphasis on clarity, coherence, and sustainability appealed to me most."

            "text": "The focus on Reception was particularly important. Reception isn't simply preparation for what comes next, it's where children begin to see themselves as learners, develop language and curiosity, and form relationships with learning itself."

        {
            "text": "Working alongside the Department for Education\u2019s Early Years Policy Team, including visiting settings together, has been invaluable. Seeing how policy translates into daily practice, and listening to practitioners talk honestly about what supports them, has reinforced something vital: policy and practice are strongest when developed together."

            "text": "Being a RISE adviser is careful, relational work. It begins with listening - to responsible bodies, school leaders and their context. The role isn't about arriving with answers, but helping leaders sharpen their own thinking."
        },
        {
            "text": "A key part is recognising strong practice that already exists. Making this visible matters - not as reassurance, but as a foundation for sustainable improvement. Often, this means supporting leaders to slow the pace of change, embed what's working, and align systems so improvement feels manageable rather than relentless."
