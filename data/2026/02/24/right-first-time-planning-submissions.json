I kept seeing applications\u202fslowed down because the basics did not line up: boundaries that did not match the registered extent, unclear ownership, or site information being re-entered and re-checked across multiple steps. None of that improves decision-making. It just creates admin.\u202f"

Rather than treating land data as something to review retrospectively, we help users consider it upfront, so that what is being applied for aligns more closely with what is actually owned and registered."

By checking site boundaries and ownership information earlier in the process, clarification requests can often be resolved before submission, reducing the likelihood of revised drawings or additional correspondence after validation."
