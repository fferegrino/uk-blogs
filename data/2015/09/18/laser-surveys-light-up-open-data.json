To replace it we had to develop a new way of delivering the data which was completely self service and able to deliver more data to a wider range of people."

At 11 terabytes, the total size of our LIDAR datasets made this quite a logistical and technological challenge and, coupled with working to a tight timescale, this has meant rolling out the data in stages."
