For larger changes, such as V5C On Demand (when a V5C registration document is suppressed, and requested on demand when one is needed) we plan communication campaigns - this will include arranging workshops, awareness sessions and updates via email, social media and through liaison groups."

Balancing everything and also meeting customer and stakeholder expectations, is the most challenging aspect of the role but also the most rewarding."
