I have also been receiving briefings and visiting some of our key sites, but of course there\u2019s always more to learn."

I spent seven years as Managing Director of AirTanker Services, which owns, maintains and operates the RAF\u2019s Voyager aircraft. Voyager is a multifunctional plane which can be used for air-to-air refuelling, transport of personnel and equipment, medical evacuation and more. Prior to that I spent six years as managing director of Flagship Training which had a partnering arrangement with the Royal Navy to help run its training estate. This involved training, delivery, construction projects and facilities management."

The Strategic Business Partner approach appears to be settling in well and delivering improvements. I\u2019m delighted to have been given the opportunity to lead such a strategically important operation."

Project WINFRA, which is working to prepare RNAS Yeovilton to be the base of the Royal Navy and the Army\u2019s Wildcat helicopter fleet, recently marked a milestone with the completion of the first new building. Other ongoing work under the project includes a new mess building, a fitness suite, dental centre, Quartermaster\u2019s stores and refurbishing the existing medical building."
