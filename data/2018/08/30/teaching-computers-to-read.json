Much of this news appears in local papers, which make up the majority of the 700+ news outlets in the UK. For some policymakers, these news stories are a useful and informal input to the policy development process."

Yet, despite our suitability to the task, there is simply too much news generated each day to keep up with. This got the Data Science team thinking: could we teach a computer to do this for us?"

But as these news results with the word \u2018car\u2019 in the headline show, this approach quickly runs into problems:"

            "text": "One way could be to write more complex rules to filter the news. For example, the Plug-in Vehicle Infrastructure team could receive articles that contain the words \u2018car\u2019 and \u2018electric\u2019 or \u2018car\u2019 and \u2018charging\u2019. But this doesn\u2019t get to the root of the issue - there are a vast amount of niche topics that different teams are interested in, and manually programing the right filters would be a mammoth task. Plus, the programmers don\u2019t have the subject matter expertise to come up with sensible filters."

This gives them an easy way to train the computer to know which articles are relevant today, based on what was relevant in the past. And using machine learning algorithms to transfer the heavy processing to the computer."

To convert text into something a computer can digest we convert sentences into a matrix of word counts, referred to as a \u2018bag of words\u2019. If we do this for a selection of the words featured in the car headline results, we can begin to spot patterns in the data. For example, the Guardian article headline features the words \u2018car\u2019 and \u2018electric\u2019 but not \u2018park\u2019 or \u2018queues\u2019."

            "text": "Without going into detail, the process involves calculating the probability that a word, for example \u2018park\u2019 will appear in documents we\u2019ve tagged as belonging to a team. And using those probabilities, it can calculate the most likely category for new documents. We can see from the word counts table the probability that articles with the word \u2018park\u2019 belong to the Parking category is much higher than the probability for the word \u2018electric\u2019.\u00a0 In reality, we apply this process to thousands of words and hundreds of articles."

We include this in a daily email and send it to the relevant team. In this way, we hope the recipient gets a summary of what the article is about without having to open the link (just in case the headline is not accurate)."

Doing so will provide the model with more data which in turn will improve the accuracy of predictions."
