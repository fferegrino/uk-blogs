Instead, our focus is mainly on policy work and system stewardship, and the delivery of our large programmes relies on the hard work of colleagues in local government, arms-length bodies like Homes England and partners in the private sector."

Not only does our old system figure strongly in day-to-day complaints from colleagues, but it also impacts on our ability to work in a modern way. In practice this means not relying on attachments and tracked changes in documents rather than collaborating in them, or carrying bundles of papers rather than having the information we need at our fingertips."

            "text": "On housing that means helping achieve more homes for people by encouraging the diversification of the housing market through supporting digital and data 'PropTech' entrepreneurs. There is a wealth of data collected across the public sector that could be used to help drive innovation, but too often that data is hard to find and build digital products upon."
