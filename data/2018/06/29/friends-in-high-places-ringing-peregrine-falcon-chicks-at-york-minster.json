            "text": "The four chicks were colour-ringed with orange rings with three black letters \u2013 allowing them to be individually recognised so we can track them as they disperse, hopefully to be picked up breeding at other sites in the area in future years."

            "text": "It was also a great exercise in engaging the Minster staff and offers more opportunities to engage the passing public in our local peregrines and our joint work. Now local residents and visitors alike can help record the life histories of these individual birds, linking into the local NNR\u2019s work on being a hub for local action in the natural environment in the wider landscape."

            "text": "It also highlights the fact that not only does York offer world class built heritage, but also the natural environment equivalent in the internationally important Lower Derwent Valley National Nature Reserves within the city boundaries and work in developing stronger links, for all sorts of benefits, between the two."
