Our radiological monitoring team works with CEFAS and our partners to pull together and analyse data from our UK-wide radiological monitoring programmes. Overall we take around 10,000 analyses and radiation dose rate measurements each year."

This year the report again shows that levels of radioactivity in food and the environment are low. Radiation doses to people living around nuclear licensed sites from authorised releases were well below the legal limit."

Everybody is exposed to this and the amount varies from person to person and place to place. Some of the main sources include soil, rocks, radon gas and cosmic rays."

            "text": "Radioactive waste is created through the routine operations of the nuclear and non-nuclear industries. Whilst this is controlled, and it is a legal requirement that the amount of waste is kept to a minimum, some radioactive waste can be released into the air or discharged to sea and to rivers under strict permit conditions. It can enter the food chain and can cause low levels of public radiation exposure."

We check their monitoring of discharges to air and water and that they are complying with the strict limits in our permits and minimising the impact of radioactivity on the environment."

We monitor beaches and mudflats by measuring radiation dose rates directly using portable dose rate meters. Samples including grass, sand, mud, water and soil are taken back to the laboratory and analysed. Air and rain is also monitored so we know the background levels and can detect if any changes occur."
