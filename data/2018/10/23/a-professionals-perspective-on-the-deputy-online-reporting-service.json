            "text": "\u201cPrior to us using the online service, we completed reports in PDF format which was an inconvenient procedure due to there not being enough space to accommodate all of our answers and the reports had to be printed for the deputy\u2019s signature.\u00a0 We tried to streamline the process by exporting data and copying and pasting it into spreadsheets, applying categories and electronically copying it on to the reporting form. We also started to apply the deputy\u2019s digital signature instead of printing the lengthy forms. However, the process was still difficult and time consuming."

            "text": "Since the start of the trial, we\u2019ve found the whole process of completing deputy reports is much easier for us. Key information is saved so you don\u2019t have to write it all out repetitively, submitting reports directly to OPG with deputy consent is easier, and small but welcome things, like the report being all on one screen, and not across two PDFs, has made filling them out simpler."

            "text": "Not having to do the report in one go has also helped save time and made the process more efficient. We\u2019ve even been able to feedback suggestions on how the system can be improved which have been implemented as suggested."

Once other elements of the form are made available digitally, we\u2019d like all our offices to switch over to this way of reporting to meet with our own vision of going more digital."
