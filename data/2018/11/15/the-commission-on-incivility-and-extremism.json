Many of our meetings have been with frontline counter-extremists, community groups and local politicians. Almost all have expressed their sadness \u2013 and shock \u2013 at the level of abuse they have experienced, particularly online, but also offline."

We have heard that those who are legitimately challenging extremists have been labelled as \u2018Islamophobes\u2019, \u2018native informants\u2019, \u2018sell outs\u2019, \u2018Uncle Toms\u2019 and worse. They have had their home addresses revealed and targeted. Their work is deliberately misrepresented, denigrated and dismissed."

They say this goes beyond the merely offensive or ill-mannered; we are now seeing an \u201cincivility that is disfiguring public life\u201d. This incivility reveals itself through misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, homophobia, gross personal invective and accusations of treachery, and much else."

The cross-party group of MPs found that it is now \u201cshockingly easy to find examples of material intended to stir up hatred\u201d on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."

Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, who earlier this year sentenced Darren Osborne for killing one man and injured nine others when he drove a van into a crowd of Muslims near a north London mosque last year, said his use of Twitter had \u201cexposed him to racists and anti-Islamic ideology\u201d and that he had been \u201crapidly radicalised over the internet by those determined to spread hatred of Muslims\u201d. "

        {
            "text": "But it goes beyond this. We know that, for some, this acts as a deterrent to get involved in counter-extremism work and is one of the main reasons why counter-extremists are understandably reluctant to talk publicly about their roles. This reduces their ability to deliver the crucial work of protecting others from harm, joining up our communities and building resilience. It also has a chilling effect on freedom of expression; where counter-extremists are fearful about the abuse and incivility they will receive if they publicly push back against extremism.\u00a0 This harms our wider democracy in two ways: the curtailment of freedom of expression and the delivery of much needed counter-extremism work that seeks to defend and uphold our democratic values from extremists who actively seek to undermine them."

            "text": "We will be asking for insight and evidence on, among other things, how extremists operate and recruit, the harms they inflict, the interaction between online and offline, and what the government can do to strengthen its response. We will also be asking what a positive alternative to the extremists\u2019 world view looks like. This will feed into a comprehensive study on all forms of extremism that we will publish next spring \u2013 our first step towards what we call a whole society response where we all play a part in defeating extremist ideas and activities.
