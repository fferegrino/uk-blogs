You work hard at school, but you\u2019re not actually sure how you will fit into the \u201cworkplace\u201d that your teachers keep mentioning, or what your future might hold. You have never really stayed away from home on your own."

You will stay at one of the world\u2019s most prestigious universities (LSE) and work with a team of professionals at the top of their game, to find ingenious solutions to real world issues."

Unbeknown to the students, our CEO Paul Morrison also attended."

To travel to London for a week, aged 16 or 17, for the very first time in your life and present your ideas to that room full of professionals was, in itself, a truly outstanding achievement for these young people."

Our team really appreciated the feedback and were particularly excited to meet the Chief Executive of the Planning Inspectorate \u00a0\u2013 but said they would have been far more nervous beforehand, had they known he was in the audience!"
