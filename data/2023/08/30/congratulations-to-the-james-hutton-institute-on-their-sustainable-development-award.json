            "text": "It is one of the UK\u2019s biggest independent research centres, with more than 500 scientists and support staff, combining interdisciplinary strengths agriculture, food security, ecosystems and resilient communities. This year, the Institute was recognised with The King's Award for Enterprise for Sustainable Development."

            "text": "\u201cWe felt we had a story to tell,\u201d says Colin Campbell, the institute\u2019s Chief Executive. \u201cThe King\u2019s Award for Enterprise in Sustainable Development was a great way to achieve this because the King\u2019s Awards are so well perceived, and you get such great profile and awareness raising."

        {
            "text": "\u201cThe award recognises the wide range of activities that we undertake, all of which is aligned with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. So it was especially appropriate for us to apply for the award for Sustainable Development.\u201d"

            "text": "\u201cWe are also leading by example through projects such as our Climate-Positive Farming Initiative, which seeks to achieve negative emissions through transforming farm activities, while our Just Transition Hub project in Aberdeen will help to build capacity and share expertise in the wider region."

            "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s why for us it was great that the award also recognises how we\u2019re addressing our own sustainability as a major research establishment, which is perhaps unusual for the King\u2019s Awards, which are traditionally awarded to businesses.\u201d"

For example, its International Barley Hub and Advanced Plant Growth Centres at its Invergowrie campus, near Dundee, are being supported through \u00a345 million funding from the UK Government and \u00a317 million from the Scottish Government, as part of the Tay Cities Region Deal. Both projects underpin its commitment to inclusive growth and sustainable food production for the future."

        {
            "text": "\u201cThe application process for the award was straight forward,\u201d explains Stefan. \u201cThrough the work we have already doing to develop our updated Climate Action Plan, which commits us to net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 and net zero scope 3 emissions by 2040, in line with the Science Based Target initiative, we already had a lot of the information and evidence we needed to put forward our case."

            "text": "\u201cFor anyone thinking about applying for the King\u2019s Award for Sustainable Development, I\u2019d say go for it. You do need to have the information to support your application, but if you\u2019re serious about sustainability, which we are, you will already have it. So go for it.\u201d"
