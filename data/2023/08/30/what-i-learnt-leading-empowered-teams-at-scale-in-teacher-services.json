We\u2019ve grown quickly and have been changing how we work together as we scale. We\u2019re moving from building great services as individual teams, to making decisions about the journey for teachers across their careers. We're also changing our role in DfE. You can see our service line here."

Everyone agreed to \u201cjoin-up\u201d more, but no-one grabbed the concept and applied it. This was partly because we didn\u2019t initially explain the detail."

Our Senior Leadership Team built collaboration and trust, and we felt the benefits of working together. We introduced a \u201ctransfer window\u201d where people could ask to move teams for a new challenge. When people moved, they brought a new perspective to their new team. They often suggested how their new and old teams might work together whilst minimising dependencies."

There is more Teacher Services can do as a service line, and I look forward to seeing how the teams take things even further!"
