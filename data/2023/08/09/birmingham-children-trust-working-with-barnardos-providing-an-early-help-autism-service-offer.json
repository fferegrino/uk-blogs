This also includes upskilling practitioners within the Early Help service, as well as offering advice, guidance, and training on autism, enabling practitioners to respond effectively to families.\u00a0"

Through being supported with accessible information and good practice guidance around autism, families are given the knowledge and the skills they need to help foster a more inclusive and empathic environment for their children. The service is quite unique in that they are supporting families while they are waiting for their diagnosis as they identified this as a gap in service and often the process can be quite lengthy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
