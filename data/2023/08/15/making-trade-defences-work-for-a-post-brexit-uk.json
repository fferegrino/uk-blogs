We conduct new cases in response to applications from companies \u2013 both UK producers and overseas exporters \u2013 who think they\u2019ve been harmed by unfairly traded imports. We have made recommendations to the Secretary of State on the first three such cases and are discussing possible applications with half a dozen UK industries."

            "text": "But the bulk of our work to date has been transition reviews, unique to the UK.\u00a0We are in the process of establishing whether measures put in place by the EU while the UK was a member and transitioned into UK law when we left the EU remain suitable.\u00a0 If they are we recommend keeping them, sometimes adjusted for UK circumstances; if not, we We\u2019re about half-way through that task, so it\u2019s worth reflecting on what has driven our findings and what consequences they have had."

            "text": "In transition reviews we look at both whether the measure is right for the UK and whether it\u2019s right for the present and future (rather than the past when it was imposed).\u00a0To determine that, we have to ask ourselves whether we think dumped or subsidised imports would be likely to continue or resume if we removed the measure; if they would, whether UK industry would be harmed, and if so, whether maintaining the measure would be in the UK\u2019s economic interests."

            "text": "It\u2019s important that measures are revoked where there is no risk of harm to UK industry, because those measures serve no purpose but to raise costs for UK consumers. For example, removing a tariff of \u00a350 to \u00a3150 per tonne on HVO biodiesel used as heating oil has the potential to expand the market by making HVO more competitive. Removing measures on steel bars and rods could be expected to reduce costs for UK importers by over \u00a3100,000 a year at current levels of imports."

        {
            "text": "But in many ways, varying a measure is more significant still. It requires us to understand the UK markets for these products in even greater detail \u2013 which domestically produced and imported products compete with one another and on what basis. The fact that we do not produce a product that is imported is not in itself decisive.\u00a0The imports might substitute for domestic production, causing harm."
        },
        {
            "text": "But when we can be sure that there is no such competition, we can safely remove the measure.\u00a0Imported glass fibre mats can\u2019t be used where chopped strands or rovings are needed.\u00a0The imported biodiesel product is 40% more expensive than the domestically produced one; it is hard to imagine many price-sensitive customers switching to it.\u00a0In road wheels, the pattern is the other way round \u2013 it is hard to imagine customers who prefer to buy, say, a \u00a3100 product today when there is a \u00a320 product readily available switching because the \u00a320 product is reduced to \u00a318.\u00a0Whichever way round, we have judged in all these cases that a measure fit for the EU is not quite right for the UK and changed it to one that is.\u00a0So we have avoided imposing costs on UK importers and consumers unless justified by the need to protect UK producers from harm."

        {
            "text": "While we have adjusted the geographical scope of some measures or the range of products they cover, we have not changed the level of duty payable on any of the products we have investigated. We have the power to recalculate a level of duty appropriate for the UK \u2013 that is, one that would eliminate the harm to UK industry without distorting trade flows more than necessary \u2013 to replace the measure assessed by the EU. But we have not yet been able to assemble the data to enable us to do so accurately or credibly in any case to date.\u00a0We expect that to be difficult, especially where the measures in force have reduced or eliminated imports.\u00a0But we are still considering whether it may be possible in some of our current cases where imports have continued while measures have been in place.\u00a0Watch this space for news of whether we achieve that."
