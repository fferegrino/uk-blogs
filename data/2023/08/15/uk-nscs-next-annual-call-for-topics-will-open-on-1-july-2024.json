During the 3-month annual call period, individuals or organisations can propose potential new screening programmes, the inclusion of new technologies in screening programmes we have not previously reviewed, modifications to current screening programmes, or early updates (following new evidence) to topics on our\u00a0list of recommendations for regular review."

It will enable the committee to commission evidence review work more promptly and prioritise emerging matters fairly and equitably. It will also help us to pursue topics that feed into our strategic initiatives, putting them into an annual workplan in line with the setting of budgets and staffing."

            "text": "This means there is now a \u00a0gap before the opening of the 2024 annual call. This will give us time to recruit the new expert evidence team staff needed to manage an increasing workload. It will also enable us to complete the UK NSC screening evidence reviews that are already under way."

However, if you have previously been advised that the next annual call would start this September then we will accept your submission this autumn, although the process will be slower than in the past. We will, as usual, keep you up to date on the progress of your proposal."
