We have over 3,500 members on Slack and regularly have 40 to 50 people joining our calls. The last time we blogged, we talked about wanting to have more regular calls and to return to face-to-face events. We\u2019ve done both! We\u2019re excited to share what we\u2019ve been up to\u2026"

            "text": "Contributions were from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Korea, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA, and Wales. We record all of the calls and share them privately with the community. With a global membership, time zones and work priorities mean we cannot find a time that works for everyone. Our recordings help with this. The most recent 8 calls have had over 1,500 collective views \u2013 so the recordings have 4 times as many views as the live calls. People value the content, get in touch with presenters to follow up on specific topics, and return to recordings or share them with colleagues when relevant."

This time, we ran an open panel discussion around the topic of the long slog of public service transformation \u2013 with participation of Estonia\u2019s \u00dclly Enn, Italy\u2019s Marco Maria Pedrazzo, and former GDS colleague Laurence Berry."
