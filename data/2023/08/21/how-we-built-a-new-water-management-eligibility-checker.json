            "text": "This checker is a new service under the \u2018Farm Transformation Fund\u2019 that allows people to check whether they potentially qualify for the grant before they have to go to the time and effort of formally applying. It\u2019s just one of the ways in which the Farming and Countryside Programme is transforming and improving the support available for the agricultural sector \u2013 with one-off grants (like this service) or ongoing agreements to incentivise and improve productivity and sustainability in the farming industry."
        },
        {
            "text": "While this was a new initiative, it built on feedback received from customers of previous agricultural grant schemes. There are lots of rules around eligibility and government funding that we cannot easily simplify, so there is always going to be a lot of information needed. The feedback told us that people just wanted a quick way of knowing if they were likely to qualify for the grant \u2013 to help them decide on whether to put the effort in to apply."
        },
        {
            "text": "This service is therefore fundamentally about making things easier for customers. It also makes it easier for our internal Grants Admin team who process the applications \u2013 as it avoids them having to spend time dealing with lots of applications that don\u2019t qualify."

            "text": "The biggest challenge in the work was developing a good understanding of what users needed, and then marrying that up with how we wanted the grants to operate. We developed an approach and service that worked \u2013 both for external customers and internal administrators \u2013 and delivered to a tight timescale."
        },
        {
            "text": "We also delivered in a way that would allow key elements of the new service to be re-used for other grant schemes that were expected to be launched subsequently. And there have been several other schemes so far \u2013 including \u2018Productivity\u2019, \u2018Slurry Storage\u2019 and \u2018Calf Housing\u2019."

The new service has saved time in the internal team by presenting the data that is provided by users through the checker in a format that is much easier for them to re-use."

            "text": "For me, though, the best thing was getting the new service launched to timescale and delivering real improvements to real users (both external customers and the internal admin team). Reducing our processing time from hours per application to minutes and giving customers more certainty that their application was likely to be accepted, was hugely satisfying."

            "text": "I recently went to speak to a group of farmers on behalf of the Programme, and it was so nice to have a conversation with some people who had recently used our system to apply. The feedback was positive, thankfully, but also highlighted some challenges and areas for further improvement. So still plenty to do!"
