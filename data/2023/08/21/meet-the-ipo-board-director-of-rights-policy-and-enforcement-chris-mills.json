Back at the beginning of the twenty-tens, I decided to take a change of direction with my career and was lucky enough to secure a job in the Civil Service. I've worked in a few different departments - the Foreign Office, Parliament, the Home Office.\u00a0"

It felt like a really big achievement and was something that not many people get to experience. That was really special.\u00a0"

The operation of the value chain was unfamiliar even to many members of the industry, so we had to get into the real detail of how it works. We\u2019ve been fostering new relationships, building trust and ultimately focusing on making a real impact on how that industry is operating - helping it to work more effectively to get remuneration to the people that deserve it.\u00a0"
