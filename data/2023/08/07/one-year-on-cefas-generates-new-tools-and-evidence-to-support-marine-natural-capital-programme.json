            "text": "Natural capital refers to\u00a0parts of the natural environment, such as forests, fisheries, rivers, biodiversity, land and minerals, that provide valuable goods and services to society. Much like human capital (labour, skills and experience), recent reviews recognise that natural capital should be seen as an economic asset that if managed effectively, can bring a whole range of benefits for society and environment."

        {
            "text": "In the ocean, the natural capital approach helps us consider the value of things like natural resources, fishing, recreation, coastal protection and/or offshore wind. It also helps us see the ocean as an interconnected system rather than individual parts. This helps address a key challenge where a lack of clear evidence and data results in markets and institutions not reflecting the true value of the goods and services that our oceans provides. With increasing pressure on our oceans for food and energy production, effective policy making requires considering a broad range of economic, social, and environmental data to make complex decisions and trade-offs."

            "text": "Our understanding of the true benefits that our oceans provide is improving through the \u00a0Marine Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (mNCEA) programme. Part of Defra\u2019s flagship Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme and started in 2022, mNCEA is a 3-year programme which aims to deliver the evidence, tools and guidance needed to help policymakers integrate natural capital approaches into policy and decision making for marine and coastal environments. Taking into account the whole marine system, Cefas works alongside its partners the Environment Agency, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Marine Management Organisation, and Natural England to deliver these projects and outcomes."
