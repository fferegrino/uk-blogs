I process Capital Grant applications where land managers can apply for items that are beneficial for them to carry out their environmental actions. Once their agreements are live, I help with validating the evidence for any completed work so their claim can be processed and paid promptly. Due to the initial outlay of expenditure to carry out any work, farmers are pleased to have their claim processed very quickly."

The Sustainable Farming Incentive Pilot has been mostly digital, but exceptions have been made and wherever possible, I help by providing the necessary information."

They were experiencing a major financial hardship and desperate for the payment that was due on their Pilot agreement. I contacted them with regular updates and sought advice from my manager on ways we could expedite their payment. Following confirmation of their completed environmental actions and declaration submission, we were able to process their payment and offer some relief during their crisis."

My family ties are quite strong even though I\u2019m thousands of miles away. Growing up within our Hindu household, my parents had implanted wonderful, wholesome traditions that my sisters and I continue to draw from, daily, be it through our shared love of vegetarian cooking, celebrating the special holidays or our passion for Indian fashion. I\u2019ve lived in the UK for about 20 years and have made it my special second home and I love it here. The mantra I live by is \u2018Be the change you wish to see in the world.\u2019"
