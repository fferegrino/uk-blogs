Whilst goods are tangible objects that physically cross international borders, services, including technology, consulting or banking, are intangible. This means their cross-border movements can be significantly more difficult to monitor.\u00a0"

Within trade policy, attempts have been made to clarify how to determine whether a product is a good or service, and the World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) work programme on e-commerce, which is still being negotiated, could shed further light. At the same time, trade in services is also becoming increasingly important. In light of this, it is worth considering whether and how trade remedies could evolve in future."

Similarly, operating software undoubtedly adds value to laptops, computers and, perhaps more recently, tablets and mobile phones \u2013 this further substantiates the integration of goods and services, particularly within global value chains.

The GATS, which entered into force in 1995, facilitates and liberalises trade within services by increasing market access for services and promoting competition alongside increased foreign investment. However, critics point towards a loss of domestic sovereignty and unequal distribution of benefits across businesses and economies. \u00a0"

Comparing the physical, chemical and technical characteristics of two or more tangible goods to establish whether they are alike is much easier than it would be for services. The notion of \u2018dumping\u2019 in trade remedies rests on comparing the prices at which products are exported abroad at a price low enough to cause injury to domestic producers. This requires a large volume of robust and verifiable data from businesses (including domestic producers and overseas exporters), which is typically much easier to obtain for goods than for services.\u00a0\u00a0"

To effectively regulate flows in services, trade policy must effectively be able to monitor the flows and countries of origin of services and come to an agreement as to how to distinguish between goods and services within value chains. Despite the challenges, there could certainly be a role for trade remedies to ensure that trade in services is fair and that it works for businesses and consumers across the world.\u00a0"
