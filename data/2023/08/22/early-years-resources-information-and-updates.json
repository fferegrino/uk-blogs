We want to make it as easy as possible for you to find all the information you need from us so that you can focus on the children you educate and care for. This blog explains some of the resources we have published and how they might be useful to you."

Each collection is organised into 2 sections, covering the EYFS and inspection. Some of the questions are relevant for all settings, but some are only relevant for certain types of provision. For this reason, the questions and answers in each guide have been adapted for the setting type."
