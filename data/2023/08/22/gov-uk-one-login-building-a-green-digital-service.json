And when we really started to look at it in detail we realised how much work has been done in this space and yet how hard it still was to get a definitive \u2018how to\u2019 guide from anywhere if you want to start to calculate the carbon footprint of your digital service.\u00a0"

We've decided to focus on how we can make the digital tech we\u2019re building as sustainable as possible, rather than trying to calculate the emissions saved by people being able to complete things online rather than perhaps taking a bus to complete a face to face interaction.\u00a0"

We think our numbers are probably under estimates and we\u2019ll continue to refine them.\u00a0"

It is not easy to compare One Login\u2019s carbon emissions to other web services as they are driven by a number of factors. However there are a number of other data points that we can use to compare One Login to other services."

The amount of data transfer impacts the amount of energy used to interact with the service, therefore impacting the overall carbon emissions attributed to citizens for using the service. Although it\u2019s not as simple as saying lower data transfer leads to lower emissions, it is a useful data point to estimate the emissions of web services and to compare One Login to others.\u00a0\u00a0"

Some examples of activities we are considering to reduce One Login\u2019s emissions include: hosting assets (e.g. images and fonts) on shared domain so the user only has to download the assets to their device once, ensuring all our computing workloads scale dynamically, removing some unused cloud assets and implementing better data classification and use policies to minimise unnecessary data storage.\u00a0\u00a0"

In GOV.UK One Login we have the glimmer of an idea that in order to do this teams will need a set of simple tools and processes they can apply and as we collaborate with GOV.UK teams on calculating their footprint we\u2019ll be adding to our lessons learned around how to measure things effectively and efficiently.\u00a0"
