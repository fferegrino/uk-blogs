Also taking part were personnel from RAF Gibraltar and No. 2 Gibraltar Air Cadet Squadron. On August 21, 2023, the group started their hike at MOD Gibraltar\u2019s headquarters at HM Dockyard."

Flt Lt Nurse was one of the participants and said, \"Walking with Jacob and the Air Cadets on such a steep route was made easier due to their unwavering enthusiasm. When you consider some of the steps were as tall as Jacob, it would have been easy for him to be put off by the route, but he took it all in his stride.\""
