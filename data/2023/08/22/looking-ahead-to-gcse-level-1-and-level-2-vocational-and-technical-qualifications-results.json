Students across the country have told us that they wanted to sit exams and assessments to show what they know, understand and can do. Grades have been determined solely on the work that students have produced, and students should be proud of their achievements."

In maths, physics, and combined science exams, students were given formulae and equation sheets, so there were fewer things to memorise for the exams. In GCSE modern foreign languages, the exams did not have to test unfamiliar vocabulary."

            "text": "For VTQs, Ofqual allowed awarding organisations to adapt their assessments in 2021/2022, so that students were supported as we emerged from the pandemic. These adaptations were designed to free up time to recover lost teaching and learning. For many students, results from those assessments will be used towards qualifications this year."

            "text": "For GCSEs, there has been a return to pre-pandemic grading this summer. There is protection in place and allowances have been made where the quality of student work is a little weaker than before the pandemic. This means that a typical student who would have achieved, for example, a grade 5 in GCSE maths before the pandemic, will be just as likely to get a grade 5 in GCSE maths in 2023, even if their performance in the assessments was a little weaker."

            "text": "VTQs have different assessment arrangements and, unlike GCSEs (where all the exams are taken at the end of the course), VTQs are designed to be flexible so students can take assessments at different times of the year. Accordingly, awarding organisations have considered what was appropriate for grading each of their qualifications. Where possible, senior examiners have been monitoring for evidence of disruption and have taken this into account when setting grade boundaries for externally examined assessments."

To seek this alignment, we required exam boards to award GCSE French and German more generously this summer, as in summer 2022."

The tests are designed to provide evidence on the performance of 16-year-old students in English language and maths. The first live\u00a0NRT, taken in 2017, was benchmarked against the first awards of the reformed GCSEs in English language and maths, and subsequent tests compare the performance of students with those in previous years. Results are reported at 3 grade boundaries \u2013 grade 7, grade 5 and grade 4. Results are reported as expected percentages of students achieving those grades (and above) based on changes in performance on the\u00a0NRT."
