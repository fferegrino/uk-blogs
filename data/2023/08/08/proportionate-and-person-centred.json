They need the space to consider how best to garner those resources to support people to live well in their communities for as long as possible."

People rely on receiving good quality, reliable information and advice, including roadmaps and the opportunity to input in relation to their options. In addition, professionals take responsibility for identifying risks and ways in which they can be mitigated."

These more creative methods make the care journey easier for people in need of support. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased to endorse the principles of proportionate assessments, which have been developed with Adult Principal Social Workers and people with lived experience."
