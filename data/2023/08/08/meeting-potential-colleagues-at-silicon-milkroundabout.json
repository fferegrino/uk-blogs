This was a perfect event for the DDaT recruitment team to attend! They have attended twice before and have made a hire from attending each time.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our aim of attending SMR is to speak to interested candidates and promote DDAT vacancies at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). We operate in such a challenging market that we need to spread the word about the department and our work as widely as possible. The DBT branding generated a lot of interest as many attendees hadn\u2019t heard about the formation of a new government department.\u00a0"

The days were split up into 3 sessions and there were 1,500 skilled professionals in attendance. Past attendees may remember the large space the event was held in previously and how challenging it was to hear candidates and have a conversation with them.\u00a0This time SMR held the event in a smaller space - this made it a lot easier to engage with people, although it was still fairly loud.\u00a0"

It was noticeable how many more female candidates there were in the first sessions. This gave us a great opportunity to talk about our majority female senior leadership team and our back-to-back shortlisting for the Women in Tech \u2018Best Public Sector Employer\u2019 award.\u00a0\u00a0"

The only way we can succeed in getting people in is to show ourselves. I really welcomed the opportunity to speak to many people that I would not ordinarily have had a chance to and to speak to the competition. Great event, well run and worth going along to.'\u00a0"

However, attending the event as an exhibitor meant that I was on the other side of the booth for the first time. The way the event was organised meant I could discuss the roles we\u2019re recruiting for in detail and field questions from jobseekers. There was a lot of curiosity about the application process, flexible working arrangements and career progression."

However, Georgia from the recruitment team was really reassuring. On the day itself I caught up with colleagues and had a quick breakfast, before starting to talk to people interested in DBT. I was the only developer, and I ended up being in high demand. I spoke almost non-stop for the whole time I was there. It was really rewarding being able to explain how we work and what we do and find out what they were looking for. I tried to encourage several of the people I spoke with to apply for DDaT roles. I hope to see some of them as colleagues in the future."

I had only been in the recruitment team for about 2 months and wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. However, my opinion changed straight away. I was made to feel at ease by the organisers and the event was set up well. The atmosphere was fantastic, and it was so great to speak to candidates face to face rather than through an email or application form."

This is more people than we have had sign up than ever before at this event. This is a fantastic testament to the amazing culture at DBT and the hard work our volunteers put in over the weekend to sell this culture. "
