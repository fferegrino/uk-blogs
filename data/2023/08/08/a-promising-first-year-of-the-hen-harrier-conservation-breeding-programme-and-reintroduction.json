This forms an important step in the Southern England Hen Harrier Reintroduction Project which is part of the Defra six-point plan for hen harrier recovery . The purpose of the breeding programme is to produce juvenile hen harriers for release into the arable landscape of Wiltshire, with the aim of creating a sustainable population in southern England. In continental Europe, hen harriers now largely nest in cereals which provide the tall dense structure that is necessary for concealing and protecting the nest. Similarly, Southern England could provide hen harriers with suitable nesting sites in cereal or other dense vegetation and vast areas to forage for food.\u00a0\u00a0"

This young breeding ability is advantageous to population viability as the population can increase much faster than species that breed later in life.\u00a0\u00a0"

Breeding behaviour gets into full swing in April, when male hen harriers show off their agility and fitness by \u2018sky dancing\u2019 and begin providing food to the females near to the breeding site. A successful pair will mate often following food provisioning and begin building their nest on the ground. The male will then continue to provide food to the female and chicks.\u00a0\u00a0"

Working with the pairs we have at the moment has been a learning curve and we are making some changes to the programme this autumn to see if they help and encourage the Hen Harriers to feel more settled and give them the confidence to move forward and breed. It's exciting, challenging, and fascinating work, but we hope to succeed in the end as they are amazing birds to work with\u201d.\u00a0"
