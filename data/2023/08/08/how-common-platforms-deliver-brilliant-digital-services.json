I came to GDS because both the organisation and I share a passion for driving positive impact for citizens and I\u2019m so happy to have seen so much evidence of that happening here in the last 6 months."

Additionally, we put a huge amount of effort into the maintenance and operations of our product suite, making sure they remain secure, accessible and available to our users."
