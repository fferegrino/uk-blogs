Not surprisingly, we\u2019ve been asked lots of questions, and we\u2019d like to address some of the more popular ones in this post."

It has been developed with input from our stakeholders, including a cross-government working group and an industry panel. In recent months we\u2019ve been testing the guidance, and are now updating it based on the feedback we\u2019ve received."

The principles cover the end-to-end project lifecycle and reflect security challenges in digital delivery faced by government organisations. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) secure design principles, which focus on secure design of a system, have been incorporated in principles five to eight."

It covers things like: security in the business case; documenting your assets; performing threat modelling; mitigating security risks; and evaluating the security impact of changes. The activities set out the what, why, when, who and how and are accompanied by templates, examples and tools to practically help project teams implement the activities.\u00a0"

            "text": "The second tool, a Security Controls Taxonomy, will help project teams select appropriate security controls from recognised industry security standards and frameworks as part of their risk mitigation activities. The controls are mapped to the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) outcomes and Indicators of Good Practice (IGPs)."

This has been cemented in the Government Cyber Security Strategy (outcome 9) and Transforming for a digital future: 2022 to 2025 roadmap for digital and data (commitment 11). The 10 Principles - expressed as outcomes - will be mandatory and central government departments and ALBs must adhere to them.\u00a0"
