These could be threatened habitats, characteristic, rare and endangered species or important geology. There are just over 4,100 SSSIs in England covering more than 1.1million hectares, around 8% of England\u2019s land area. "

Instead of subdividing SSSIs into units and making assessments of condition at the unit scale, we now assess the condition of special features across the whole of a SSSI. This approach, known as Whole Feature Assessment, helps us to better understand what is affecting features and how SSSIs function as part of their wider landscape.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

At the start of April this year, 38% of SSSIs (by area and by feature) were recorded as being in favourable condition. This figure has not changed much in recent years, due in part to relying on historic data. With increased funding over the past couple of years, Natural England is now investing in updating condition assessments and developing a long-term, prioritised monitoring plan. \u00a0"

The first target, to have an up-to-date condition assessment for every SSSI, will make sure that land managers can be confident about the state of their special sites and what actions are necessary, by whom, to recover or maintain it in favourable condition. \u00a0"

We\u2019ve tripled the number of Natural England staff carrying out SSSI monitoring over the past 5 years, and currently spend \u00a31.4m a year on SSSI monitoring.\u00a0"

We recognise it is important that landowners and managers are properly recognised and rewarded for their efforts to bring and maintain sites into favourable condition. Agri-environment schemes are an important way to achieve this, and we are working with Defra as they develop and roll out the new Environmental Land Management schemes to properly pay farmers and land managers to provide environmental goods and services alongside food production.\u00a0\u00a0"
