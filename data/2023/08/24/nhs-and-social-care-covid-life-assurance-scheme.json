However, three years ago, none of us expected to find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic, when even the most rudimentary health and care tasks became fraught with risk and uncertainty."

If you\u2019re a care provider, I urge you to contact the families and dependents of colleagues you sadly lost and share this information with them. As the cost of living continues to put a strain on the nation\u2019s finances, it is our duty of care, as senior managers and leaders, to signpost financial relief which could make all the difference."
