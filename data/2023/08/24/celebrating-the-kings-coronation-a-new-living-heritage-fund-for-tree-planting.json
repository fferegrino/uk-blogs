We are excited to see these develop within communities as they emulate a more naturalistic growth to a local area, and by planting mixed native species at close densities in small patches, we see higher survival rates. They also require minimal maintenance after two to three years and have lower vulnerability to vandalism, helping to contribute to a lasting heritage."

Community orchards are excellent places for people to come together to plant a variety of fruit trees and to use the area for community activities. They increase bee numbers and are a great opportunity for schools and the communities to learn about wildlife, planting, and maintenance of trees. They give healthy food to people, as well as supporting wildlife and improving the land in a natural way."
