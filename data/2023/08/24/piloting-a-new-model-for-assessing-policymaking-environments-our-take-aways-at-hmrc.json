            "text": "Throughout 2022, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) partnered with the Policy Profession Unit (PPU) on their Shared Policy Capability Project. Sponsored by our Head of Policy Profession, Cerys McDonald, we worked with a diverse group of policymakers from across our department to develop a model for departments to assess their policy environment."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over three months, the PPU team facilitated a self-assessment of HMRC\u2019s policymaking environment, through which evidence and insights were gathered and discussions about opportunities for improvement started. It was a bottom-up and collaborative approach allowing an open and honest discussion about our policymaking environment."

            "text": "This was a genuinely collaborative effort between the PPU team and HMRC. Both teams brought new techniques, approaches, and perspectives to the table. Whilst some project phases took longer than planned or gave rise to unexpected considerations (as with most policy projects), the outcome of the collaboration was really valuable for us."
        },
        {
            "text": "In particular, the assessment model helped us to focus on a number of workstreams which were touching on similar questions, but from different angles. For us in HMRC, these included longer-term strategic exercises, our skills, learning and development programmes, and also areas such as knowledge management."
        },
        {
            "text": "The facilitated self-assessment was also an excellent mechanism to bring together internal stakeholders beyond the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 in a meaningful way. We reached out to those involved in policymaking in the broadest sense, but who may not be policy professionals, and colleagues from across grades. We really saw the value in doing this and bringing a huge range of perspectives into our thinking."

            "text": "That said,\u00a0the programme wasn\u2019t without challenge. We spent much longer than expected in the initial scoping phase of the project, working with PPU to build greater understanding of factors specific to HMRC \u2013 such as our formal Policy Partnership with HM Treasury, and how the annual Finance Bill process sets the tempo of policymaking in HMRC. We also identified some parts of the original project plan which would have duplicated existing work undertaken in HMRC and we, therefore, worked closely with PPU to explore how we could ensure that the assessment would build on the foundations we already had. If doing this again, we would also put more emphasis into increasing participation rates and getting the most from the peer review function, making sure we got the most out of a valuable opportunity to engage with a \u2018critical friend\u2019."

Some of those were already on our radar \u2013 such as reviewing our governance structures \u2013 but the project helped us break down silos and improve our plans to tackle issues together."
