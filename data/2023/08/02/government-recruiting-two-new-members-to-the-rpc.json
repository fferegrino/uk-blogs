            "text": "If you are passionate about evidence-based policy making and care about the real-world impacts of regulation on businesses and households as well as its impact on growth, innovation and competition, then Government is seeking to appoint two new members to the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC). As the independent Better Regulation watchdog, the RPC scrutinises regulatory impact assessments and post-implementation reviews under the Government\u2019s Better Regulation Framework.We review the quality of the evidence and analysis underpinning government regulations to ensure that those measures are properly evidence-based and to provide reassurance of the quality of the analysis to parliamentarians, businesses and wider stakeholders. You would be joining the RPC at a key time as we transition to a new Framework, as set out in \u201cSmarter Regulation to Grow the Economy\u201d.If you are an economist with expertise in cost-benefit analysis, policy appraisal and evaluation (and the ability to review Free Trade Agreement Impact Assessments for one of the roles), then please think about applying. More information on the roles (which are part-time - 1 day per week) and the application process can be found here. The deadline for applications is 4th September."
