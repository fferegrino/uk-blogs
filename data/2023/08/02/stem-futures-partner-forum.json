An overview from our Technical Hubs provided insight into the range of placements and training opportunities being delivered across communities of interest. These being centred around data, reliability and Weapons, Ordnances, Munitions, and Explosives (WOME). New communities of interest are also in development stage, focused on systems thinking and nuclear. Over the next year, we will continue to consolidate and develop the opportunities offered through our communities. \u00a0"
