            "text": "Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council has invested in developing an integrated Start Well model which brings together services that work with families to support children\u2019s development from pre-birth to 5 years and help them to get ready for school. Start Well teams work together with other services to make sure that all children in Stockport receive the right support at the right time to help their early development. Local Start Well teams are made up of health visitors and early years workers. Family Help coordinators also undertake work with families who require a \u2019team around the family,\u2019 or a set of services coordinated together to support the whole family. This can include families who need more complex early help assessments and support. This means that whole family working, rather than one service working with different family members at a time, is a key part of the approach."

Unique to Stockport is the leadership, management structure and delivery of the Start Well model. Start Well operates under joint governance arrangements between Stockport Council and Stockport NHS Foundation Trust with an overarching twin ambition of improving child development outcomes and school readiness outcomes at reception age."

The model provides support to families and undertakes early identification of babies and children\u2019s developmental needs. Alongside the Start Well approach is a Family Help service delivery model in Stockport which is a 0-19 early help model of Family Help coordinators who support early help. They support the coordination required at an early help level through early help assessment for the increasing complexity in need for many babies and their families on Health Visitors\u2019 named caseloads. We work closely with our Children\u2019s Social Care colleagues, and a dedicated vulnerable children\u2019s safeguarding team managed by the Stockport Foundation Trust supports health visitors, school nurses and FNP nurses in their safeguarding supervision."

Families in Stockport are supported by one of 44 Band 6 named Health Visitors rather than cases being held centrally in a corporate system. These Health Visitors are supported by a small group of Band 5 nurses \u2013 many of whom are gaining experience and skills on their journey to applying for Specialist Community Public Health Nurse (SCPHN) qualifications."

Locality leads come from different background disciplines in council early years and health visiting. They work jointly under agreed Start Well managerial arrangements which sit across both NHS and local authority services. Start Well has a suite of bespoke job descriptions that draw on both health and early years skills to reflect the integrated work being undertaken, however the team\u2019s staff remain under separate accountability arrangements according to their discipline."

This framework sets out both core and specialist skills elements that relate to perinatal mental health, public health nursing and more, in a modular approach. Stockport aims to \u2018reclaim universalism\u2019 for all staff, training a varied workforce that is confident and competent to deliver for families."

Stockport has a system-wide model of restorative practice which is recognised by all, which helps to bind different professional principles and priorities together under a common understanding.
