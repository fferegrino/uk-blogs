To have national recognition for my years of hard work was something I had never contemplated. My family and friends were so excited and the support from my colleagues at Risedale Nursing Homes has been overwhelming."

Throughout this time, I have worked ceaselessly to prove to anyone who would listen that social care is not a second-class service. My mantra has always been \u201cwe need the best nurses not the worst\u201d."

        {
            "text": "I also believe that anything is achievable if you want it enough and use your passion, determination and true grit to fight for it. I have applied these values to a nurse training programme within Risedale Nursing Homes. We now have over 30 nurses registered and a further 46 in training. We will be self sufficient in nurses for many years to come."

            "text": "I wanted our carers to be able to progress to Registered Nurse status as many would have been unable to do so through traditional routes. They have rewarded my faith in them every single day with their commitment, passion and enthusiasm. I believe the standard of nurse we employ is second to none and the beneficiaries of this are the most important people within the company: the residents."
