And there\u2019s no difference between cooking meals for prisoners and Armed Forces personnel \u2013 if they don\u2019t like your food, they\u2019ll soon let you know!"

            "text": "When I first left the Army, after serving for nearly 16 years, I worked split shifts in a pub restaurant kitchen. Six days a week, I\u2019d start at 9am, finish around 3pm, be back in work for 5pm and often not get home until midnight. The main reason I\u2019d left the Army was to spend more time with my family, so it wasn\u2019t long before I was looking for a new job with better hours."

I applied, was successful, and started what\u2019s been a great second career for me in prison catering. Starting off as a Band 3 caterer, I was promoted to catering supervisor within 4 years. And, following another progression 4 years later, I\u2019ve been a catering manager ever since."

            "text": "The transition from Army chef to prison caterer was easy for me. Just like in the Army, there\u2019s a great sense of teamwork and camaraderie in a prison kitchen and the focus is on getting meals out on time for large numbers of hungry people. The main differences are that in prisons, we work alongside prisoners and the kitchen knives are kept in locked cabinets and checked in and out every day."

The prisoners you work with are generally happy to be out of their cells and working. While they\u2019re obviously in prison for a reason, they\u2019re people just like you and me. You just need to be able to give them clear instructions and supervise their work.\u00a0"

            "text": "Prison caterers supervise prisoners to prepare meals for the prison population. Many of the individuals you work with have little or no knowledge of catering, so a key part of your role is showing them how to cook different meals and teaching them how to work safely and efficiently in a large kitchen. The new skills prisoners learn can be beneficial when they leave prison. For some, it could simply mean they are able to cook affordable, nutritious meals for themselves and their families. Others choose to study for catering qualifications while they\u2019re in prison, increasing their chances of employment when they return to their communities. This is one of the most rewarding parts of the job: knowing your work has an impact far beyond the kitchen."
