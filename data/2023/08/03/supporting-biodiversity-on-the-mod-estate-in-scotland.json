This provided a great opportunity to extend a feeding \u2018corridor\u2019 through Barry Buddon to boost the butterfly\u2019s populations within the site and across the surrounding local region."

Since 2022, we\u2019ve focused on continuing the removal of thatch and moss from road verges to provide the growing conditions that Kidney Vetch requires, while monitoring the distribution of the Small Blue across the feeding corridors created."
