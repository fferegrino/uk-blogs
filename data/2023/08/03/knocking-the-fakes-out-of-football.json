Last year we launched our Counter-Infringement Strategy, which aims to combat IP crime by enhancing intelligence, developing valuable partnerships and producing impactful campaigns, of which this campaign delivered."

We identified the target audience by examining consumer opinion and online social commentary around counterfeit football goods. The campaign was also aligned with the seizure of counterfeit football shirts by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU)."
