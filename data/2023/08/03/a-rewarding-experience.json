            "text": "Disaster risk financing, or DRF, aims to reduce the impact on those living in poverty who are often the most vulnerable when a crisis hits. Traditionally the approach to responding to disasters has been reactive, for example through humanitarian appeals, and this can mean any funding is slow and often insufficient."

            "text": "DRF is about setting up financial instruments before disasters happen so funding can be released at the right time and targets those most in need.

This was especially true when I had the opportunity to support the development of a country\u2019s disaster risk finance strategy. I worked alongside the government and a donor-funded programme to develop the financing instruments part of the strategy."

Before joining the Centre, I thought \u201cI know very little about this area of work, how am I going to be any use to the team?\u201d. However, my secondment has made me more creative and has shown me that the actuarial skillset can be used in many different ways."
