So, for now we\u2019re keeping the paper version too. That being said, since we took the step to begin going digital, we\u2019ve had some great feedback from those who have opted to receive their licence by email or text rather than through the post."

We want more of anglers\u2019 licence fees to go straight back into angling, fisheries improvement projects and enforcement rather than on print costs which mostly are now unnecessary. You can see where every penny of rod licence income goes in the Fisheries Annual Report."

So, we created a survey and circulated it to 2000 anglers who had recently bought a licence. We also commissioned a market research company to call up 100 anglers who had told us they do not like being communicated with by email."

For example, we recognise some anglers will want to print their licence at home or take screen shots."

This leads to more lengthy and difficult licence checks."

After all, a key part of our service vision is allowing anglers to relax and enjoy their fishing. Due to limitations presented by screen shots when it comes to our enforcement officers being able to verify whether they are genuine, additional checks will be required."
