Students from across the country have told us that they wanted to sit exams and formal assessments to show what they know, understand and can do. Grades have been determined solely on the work that students have produced, and students should be proud of their achievements."

We\u2019d also like to recognise the hard work of so many school, college and training provider staff who have been involved in delivering the new requirements to support the timely delivery of VTQ results this summer."

Getting back to normal is important so that qualifications prepare students for college, university or employment in the best possible way, and help them to make the right choices about their next steps."
