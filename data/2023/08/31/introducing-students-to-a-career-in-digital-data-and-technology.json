Ensuring that students are equipped with knowledge of \u2018what exists out there\u2019 as a career choice is an important part of the journey. It benefits future employees and employers. This Summer, the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team were delighted to play their part in highlighting what a career in the Department for Business and Trade(DBT), and in particular DDaT, might look like for A level students at Exeter College in the South\u00a0West.\u00a0\u00a0"

Andy explains \u201cWe know that apprenticeships are an excellent source of undiscovered talent, and interest in them has grown substantially. We are hearing from younger people joining the workforce for the first time, and from more experienced people looking to change careers, or seeking to gain accreditation in their professions\u201d.\u00a0"

Ed Sweatman, their head of Careers, was keen to deliver a \u2018Hidden Careers\u2019 event to talk about parts of the Civil Service that students were perhaps less aware of as career routes. The day was a huge success with DBT and the Rural Payments Agency focusing on digital career opportunities in particular. This is the first time that One South West have delivered such a session. We hope to expand our outreach offer across the region over the next 12 months.\u201d\u00a0"

We worked as a South West team to ensure our sessions were as informative as possible. My own teenagers are about to start their career journey, so I understand how much it means to young people when employers engage and offer advice and support\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0"
