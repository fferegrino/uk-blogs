Given the pace at which we are delivering cloud services to the organisation the requirement for breadth and agility of skills is constantly changing. As a result, we pioneered the creation and recruitment of a new role \u2013 the DevSecOps Engineer! This role embeds thinking around security risk and mitigation and places this squarely in the middle of our \u2018DevOps\u2019 working practice."

We ask colleagues, including across Government, what challenges and adaptation journeys they have been on and learn from their experience. We ask for help; we try things and get creative. Sometimes we even fail, and that\u2019s a MASSIVELY good thing, allowing us to learn fast and pivot."

The whole team gathers monthly and runs down the list of cloud processes we operate to see if they are still valid, could be optimised or in some cases are no longer needed; it\u2019s a great way to look across our estate and identify where we can automate things."

As we move further along our cloud journey, there are ways that we look at these repeatable tasks and ask whether there are more automatable/bot-driven ways of undertaking these to ensure we maximise our time and add value. Some of our successes so far are automating account creation and deletion across the cloud ecosystem and notifying users of dormant cloud accounts. As a central operational hub we are also responsible for propagating the question of \u2018can this operational task be automated?\u2019 as early as possible in the design phases for products we support, allowing us to help that get built quickly. This is going to be an exciting area as AI-driven tooling becomes more reliable and adoptable."

At time of writing, we have 27 separate cloud services on our catalogue; this approach enables us to efficiently operate multiple services in parallel based on the key information needed to do so."

Though a bit of an oversimplification, cloud service consumption can loosely be defined as a \u2018pay as you go\u2019 contract with our cloud suppliers. This shift has allowed ONS to look at more efficient ways of delivering the same outcome using cloud services. However, this has created a need to keep on top of costs and commitments, which is where FinOps (Financial Operations) comes in. Our team is responsible for centralising the billing views across the public clouds and helping teams to understand where cost can be saved through embedded culture (e.g., through switching off cloud resources when not in use and deleting old projects) and cloud service design. We are also working closely with the architecture teams on a \u2018tagging\u2019 strategy that will allow us to map and observe how the organisation is using cloud services, enabling us to advise and steer teams in optimum use of cloud. Crucially, each cloud vendor is also heavily committed to the use of renewable energy to power their data centres in the next 10 years, so we can also help teams understand what the carbon footprint of their project is and how to optimise it."
