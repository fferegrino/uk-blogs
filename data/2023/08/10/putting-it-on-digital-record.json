            "text": "A DSCR solution (which you may also know as an electronic care plan) allows the digital recording of care information and care received by an individual, within a social care setting, replacing traditional paper records. DSCRs allow information to be shared securely and in real-time with authorised individuals across the health and care sector."

            "text": "They have the potential to transform the way in which care is provided. Moving care plans from paper to electronic formats makes it easier for care workers and managers to get the information they need to respond more quickly to people\u2019s needs, minimise risks to people\u2019s safety and reduce time wasted on administration and reporting."

Already, 1,000 providers can access relevant information from GP records through their DSCR and that\u2019s just the beginning."

In May, they published guidance about DSCRs and their importance in achieving good outcomes for people who use services. The guidance states that \u201cdigital records will increasingly replace paper records, meaning digital systems will be vital to capture and share information. This is essential for truly integrated services that work for people\u201d. It also summarises what good digital social care records look like, signposting readers to our list of assured solution providers, which have been tested to ensure they meet the needs of care providers."

If you are one of them, we\u2019re here to help. From a list of assured solutions, funding and skills support, we can support you to move away from paper-based record keeping and to see how a digital approach can support you in achieving good outcomes for people using adult social care services."
