Security vulnerabilities are discovered all the time online and people want to be able to report them directly to the organisation responsible. That\u2019s why we are advocating for the use of security.txt as a standardised way of doing just that. One of the most important elements of vulnerability disclosure, and a challenge for the finder, is understanding who to contact. "

Quick, easy and secure reporting directly to the affected department speeds up the triage and remediation time and reduces the risk of compromise, such as reporting of a vulnerable web server so it can be remediated before being exploited. The security.txt was endorsed by the Data Standards Authority in March 2023."
