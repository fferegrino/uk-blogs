            "text": "As part of the work of the GOV.UK publishing team, we regularly iterate and improve Whitehall to ensure it meets user needs. From our user research, and analysis of performance data in Google Analytics, we noticed that one of the highest errors for publishers was uploading images so we wanted to see how we could improve this."

Meaning important government content is published quicker, helping users get information faster, clearer and in a more engaging way. Also helping improve accessibility issues for those with reading difficulties or using assistive technology."

            "text": "Previously, adding images into Whitehall was complicated. For starters, the image prompt was located in the middle of a long page which was filled with required and optional input fields that generated the structure of a GOV.UK page. Publishers sometimes made mistakes and would have to re-enter information, slowing the publication process. We noticed that many errors were from uploading an incorrect file type, as well as uploading images that were in the wrong dimensions."
        },
        {
            "text": "In the latter case, a publisher would come across an error message if the image\u2019s dimensions were not exactly 960 pixels by 640 pixels. Even if they had inputted all the fields correctly. In order to proceed in the document creation process, publishers would need to find a third-party tool to then resize images to those specific dimensions. As a result, images would sometimes appear distorted or pixelated just so they could adhere to those strict image dimensions."

            "text": "We also realised that deleting an image caused further frustration for users of Whitehall. This was because we were using a numbered process, where every image uploaded to a document was given a number that a user then added in markdown for the image to appear in the final draft. When a user deleted an image, everything had to be reordered and their page updated manually which wasted time and effort."

We brought together 10 people from various disciplines, including a user researcher, a delivery and a product manager, a front and a back-end developer, along with a couple of content designers."

        {
            "text": "After becoming familiar with the problem space, we ran a 5-minute rapid sketching session following which everyone shared their sketches on how they would go about designing a possible solution. Even though each participant\u2019s approach was influenced by their respective discipline, common patterns and ideas were present. We explored and refined these further, while ensuring that they not only abided by interaction design best practice but were also viable."

        {
            "text": "We worked in an agile way, starting small and building incrementally, so before starting technical implementation, we broke down the various design ideas into a number of phases. This allowed us to prioritise features based on a combination of user needs and complexity of implementation."

            "text": "We have streamlined the workflow, so that images no longer have to be uploaded on the edit document page. Instead, they now appear on a dedicated tab once a new document has been saved. This dedicated images tab allows publishers to upload images and manage those that have already been uploaded. For instance, publishers can make any necessary adjustments to the image and copy the image\u2019s unique markdown code."

The application now uses the uploaded image's filename and type as its markdown identifier, rather than a numerical value. This change should help publishers ensure the correct image appears in the right place in their document, as well as removing the task of having to update image markdown."
