The council are responding proactively to fill in gaps in areas where traditionally children\u2019s social care may not have worked closely with more universal services spanning health and early years education."

The Baby and Me approach sees social workers, backed by family support and universal health, development and early years education services, working together with community and specialist services from across the local partnership. The Baby and Me team around the family are working intensively with vulnerable expectant parents in the earliest part of the pregnancy, including with families where babies have previously been taken into care."

            "text": "The approach blends statutory social work oversight with family support and a focus on promoting strong parent-infant relationships as early on as possible. The aim of Baby and Me is to change the trajectory of escalation towards young babies being placed into care and adopted. The upskilling and specialising of social work teams in this way is partly with the aim to break down traditional professional silos and thresholds to counter gaps in services that families experience, such as limited access to services due to having moved out of borough or not fitting the criteria for specialist services such as the dedicated Family Nurse Partnership who work with the youngest expectant and new parents in Redbridge."

It is now on offer to many families who are not subject to social care involvement but are working with Early Help targeted services. Here babies\u2019 circumstances remain complex although families engage with this intensive support in a voluntary and consent-based arrangement."

The council are currently building up a wider workforce that can roll out \u2018making every contact count,\u2019 the approach of helping families and people navigate and connect to services at every given opportunity- whether universal or targeted. Community connectors undertake listening exercises to understand how different communities may want to access or experience public health, community, and universal services. Developing plans for the rollout of a Community Hub in Redbridge is seeing the council further harness the local voluntary sector\u2019s capacity to identify problems and find solutions within the community, and to reach families from all walks of life."
