I\u2019m Beth McAdam, and in today\u2019s programme, we revisit the topic of mapping, and discuss why making accurate and timely updates to your land parcels is now more important than ever. We also discuss the Sustainable Farming 2023 standards and look at the great reasons to apply for them, and finally, we\u2019ll be hearing about educational farm visits and how feedback from one farmer helped to significantly improve the Farm Visit Declaration Form."

The SFI 23 offer was launched last month and here to talk about it is Ali Johnson, RPA\u2019s Engagement and Operational Readiness Director. Thanks for joining us Ali"

There\u2019s no minimum or maximum land area or hedgerow length, so farmers can choose how much land to cover with their SFI agreement. You don\u2019t need the permission of your landlord to apply for an agreement if you're a tenant farmer, and tenants can have an SFI agreement even if they\u2019re on a shorter, rolling tenancy contract."

We\u2019ve listened to the great feedback we\u2019ve had from farmers, and done a huge amount to streamline and improve the Sustainable Farming Incentive, making it as simple and flexible as possible for farmers to engage with and apply for.\u00a0We\u2019ve been working with farmers to make sure that the application process is clear and straightforward.\u00a0\u00a0If your land is eligible and the actions you pick are compatible, you\u2019ll get an agreement. It's as simple as that. There\u2019s no competitive to the scheme. The agreement will start the month after you accept it."

Farmers doing these activities tell us they benefit their farm business by helping reduce costs and get an income from less productive areas of land. It\u2019s also straightforward to apply and manage your agreement. You can apply online and your agreement will start the month after you accept it. We\u2019ve changed the way we check delivery of the agreement to make it more flexible and pragmatic - we don\u2019t apply penalties and where things don\u2019t go as planned, we\u2019ll work with you to help you\u00a0 fix it.\u00a0 There is no lower limit on the amount of land you can enter into SFI or the actions you can take. Once you\u2019re in SFI, you can on an annual basis add more land and actions to your agreement. And finally, regarding payments, you\u2019ll be paid quickly and payments are made quarterly and it\u2019s also worth mentioning again that you can be in SFI and Countryside Stewardship at the same time as long as the actions are compatible and we\u2019re not already paying you for the action under CS."

Your\u00a0land information must be current and complete before you begin the application process, so if you have any land updates, changes or corrections, it\u2019s important to notify RPA of any changes as the land data is needed by us to ensure that we can make accurate payments."

Land details shown on your digital maps in the\u00a0Rural Payments service\u00a0are used for several of the land-based schemes and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep your mapping up to date."

But generally, farmers can help us by making sure all the required fields are completed within the RLE1 form, and by providing clearly annotated maps, as this helps to reduce the time taken to process mapping changes and may reduce the need for further clarification conversations, as well as following the guidance when emailing forms."

RPA maps and tracks 2.6million land parcels, using a range of intelligence and technology to keep these as accurate as possible and we receive over 20,000 RLE1 forms each year requesting mapping changes.

            "text": "Anne-Marie: \u00a0Yes, we\u2019ve also increased the use of geospatial data to reduce the visit burden on farmers. Geospatial data is geographical data which includes legal boundaries, reference features, land cover types, linear features and background imagery. We use this information to monitor any issues with scheme controls, concerns from farmers, and areas where advice is being requested. This helps us to support farmers and land managers to meet outcomes before a Field Officer visits."

We\u2019re exploring options to allow farmers and land managers to amend their land details online, which aims to reduce the amount of time to submit land changes and improve processing times. We\u2019re reviewing options and will outline these at a later date. This builds on the RLE1 improvements we made in 2020, when a new process was launched, which gave the option of completing a digital RLE1 form. This has proven to be a very popular submission route, with over 75% of the forms now being received via email."

So, the visits we have, we have a general layout where in the morning we do a farm walk, have a look at some of the farming we do, the crops we grow, maybe how much seed we need to buy, do a bit of maths, have a look at the growing crop at whatever stage it's at. We'll have a look at the margins and the hedges and talk about why they are important on the farm. And at the end of that we'll have some sort of hands-on activity. Might be digging for worms. It could be doing a bug hunt in one of the pollen and nectar margins, or it could be in the autumn, could be collecting leaves."

So looking at dentition and teeth and, and how different animals have got different teeth and yeah, a bit of all sorts maybe sitting on a tractor. And from, from what I see, the benefits that children get is just astounding. Yeah, you've got children, particularly if for working with a country trust where they're coming out of sort of any city schools, they've never even seen a nettle, never mind anything else and just the space. And it's marvellous. And one teacher said to me, yeah, we can go to a petting farm and we get back at the end of the day and say, well, we stroked a rabbit, we stroked a guinea pig. We come here, there's endless extra sort of work that they can build on from the visit."

Yes, I want to get feedback from schools but you know, I can do that by talking to them, I mean I just do ours orally. But that is just fabulous. I can fill in most of the front of it, which is the factual when they\u2019re coming, who they are. That leaves just one box and a signature really, for the school to do. Fantastic."
