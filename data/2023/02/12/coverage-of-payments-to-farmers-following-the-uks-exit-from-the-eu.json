As per the Government\u2019s manifesto, the full \u00a32.4 billion per year previously awarded in EU farming subsidies is continuing to go to farmers. This has been guaranteed by the government for the lifetime of this parliament."

This includes\u00a0our Environmental Land Management schemes such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive, as well as\u00a0our simplified Countryside Stewardship scheme.\u00a0In 2021/22 we spent \u00a3109m on \u00a0Countryside Stewardship and \u00a311m on the Farming in Protect Landscapes fund \u2013 alongside many other initiatives and\u00a0one-off grants\u00a0to ensure sustainable food production can go hand in hand with protecting the environment."

While there was a small degree of underspend in 2021/22,\u00a0this money has been made available for farming schemes in 2022/23. As per the annual report, \u00a31.65 billion in direct subsidies were awarded to farmers in 2021/22, in line with the figures set out in the Agricultural Transition Plan."

The Sustainable Farming Incentive only opened in July 2022 with a limited range of actions for farmers to be paid for. Payments are made quarterly, meaning any agreements starting after September are not reflected in the amount paid to farmers last year. More than 2,000 farmers are now signed up to the scheme and we expect this number to continue to rise \u2013 and with it more money reaching farmers\u2019 bank accounts \u2013 with the introduction of six further standards this year and more to come in 2024 and 2025. This will ensure there is something on offer for every farmer."
