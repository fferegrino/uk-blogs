            "text": "HT is open to all eligible farmers and land managers, including those new to CS and those with existing CS and Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements.\u00a0 HT agreements are 5, 10 and sometimes 20-year agreements which support farmers and land managers to maintain some of our most environmentally important sites, including Sites of Special Scientific Interest, commons and woodlands. These are usually in places that need complex management, such as creating or restoring habitats, and improving woodland."

            "text": "We want to encourage applications for agri-environment options from all farmers and land managers, not just those who have already been approached by a Natural England adviser. In particular, applications are welcome from those who want to protect, restore, enhance or create habitats, such as flower rich hay meadows, heathland, moorland, and wood pasture, as well as managing other aspects of their land."

Along with the other environmental land management schemes CS will offer a viable, long-term source of income for providing environmental benefits as the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments are reduced."

CS Plus will deliver the same high environmental ambition previously planned for Local Nature Recovery, including managing floodplain meadows to reduce flood risk and improve biodiversity, restoring and maintaining peatland for carbon capture and storage, and enhancing and managing woodland to mitigate against drought and enhance its resilience to climate change."
