Almost all these mines had closed by the early 1900s but they are still releasing harmful metals including lead, cadmium and copper.\u00a0 This is one of the top 10 issues for water quality in England as it harms fish and river insects. Abandoned mines are the largest source of metals to British rivers and seas (click here for more information). Pollution is localised to about 1,500km of rivers - mainly in the North East, Cumbria, Yorkshire & Cornwall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "The worst river pollution by metals is caused by water flowing out of tunnels dug by miners. Rainfall also washes metals out of the millions of tonnes of highly contaminated wastes the miners left at the surface. Climate change will worsen the environmental impacts because drier summers mean there will be less dilution of polluting mine water but conversely, more intense rainfall will wash even more metals into rivers from wastes.\u00a0"

            "text": "Usually, the polluted rivers look clear because metals like lead and cadmium aren\u2019t visible. However, more alarmingly, rivers can turn orange when the mine waters contain lots of iron. To check for pollution, we collect water samples, measure the metal concentrations in a laboratory and compare the results with environmental standards set to protect wildlife.\u00a0"

The main way to clean up this pollution is to capture the metals in mine water treatment schemes before they can enter rivers. Where possible, we try to use nature-based solutions as they have lower whole-life cycle costs and a much smaller carbon impact.\u00a0\u00a0"

The mine workings gradually filled up with rain water with devastating effect - in January 1992, 50 million litres of extremely acidic water was released in a single day, turning the Carnon River and the Fal Estuary orange but also polluting them with invisible harmful metals. The Government built a system to treat the mine water which is now managed by the Coal Authority as part of the Defra-funded WAMM Programme.\u00a0\u00a0"

In a typical year, 5.6 billion litres of mine water are treated \u2013 equivalent to 6 Olympic swimming pools each day \u2013 preventing 800 tonnes of harmful metals from polluting the environment.\u00a0\u00a0"
