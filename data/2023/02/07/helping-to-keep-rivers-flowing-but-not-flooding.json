We cut weeds and desilt river channels to keep them clear and to prevent flooding. When flood risk is greater, we prepare by making sure that flood assets, trash screens and culverts are clear of obstructions."

We help by testing oxygen levels and use aerators to pump more oxygen into the water. In extreme situations we sometimes have to relocate fish into other watercourses. This is done very carefully by specialist fisheries officers who have expert knowledge on where fish can be moved safely, to avoid the risk of transferring invasive or non-native species to pristine watercourses."
