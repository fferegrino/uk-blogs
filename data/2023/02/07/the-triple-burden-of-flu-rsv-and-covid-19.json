            "text": "We saw reduced flu transmission resulting in lower flu levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to social distancing measures and widespread use of face coverings. The relaxing of these measures means that flu is circulating at higher levels, increasing the burden on healthcare settings."

Like the flu, RSV is a highly infectious respiratory virus, and accounts for over half a million GP appointments and over 40,000 hospitalisations a year, largely affecting young children and the elderly."

We do not currently have accurate estimates of the levels of flu circulating among healthcare workers."

In addition, we do not yet understand how flu interacts with COVID-19 and what impact this may have. \u00a0This is particularly important now that we have moved into a phase in the pandemic where protection measures have reduced, and flu and COVID-19 are circulating at the same time."

It is crucial to understand the extent of the burden respiratory viruses place on healthcare workers so that employers can look after the health and wellbeing of staff, which is important in its own right and the foundation of high-quality patient care."
