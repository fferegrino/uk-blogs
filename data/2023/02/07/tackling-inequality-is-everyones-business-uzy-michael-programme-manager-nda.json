I am happy to be working for an organisation that is actively and progressively taking steps to make the work environment more diverse and inclusive, recognising the value we all bring \u2013 irrespective of race, gender, sex, age, religious beliefs, or any other differences."

There were many others like myself who spoke with an accent like mine, looked physically like me \u2013 black (and I was not bald at the time!) and had lived through similar experiences coming from Africa. I could grab a plate of jollof rice (a lovely West African dish I recommend you try \u2013 thank me later!) with some foreign export Nigerian Guinness easily. I attended clubs and parties with an afrobeat theme as I was used to back at home in Nigeria. These were some of the best times in the UK for me."

I had six rotations across the country which meant that over 16 months I lived in 6 different parts of the UK. I quickly realised I had to work on my ability to integrate better amongst the different cultures as well as be willing to share my story with others and integrate them into my culture."

An ally is not necessarily a member of a marginalised group but someone who wants to support and take action to help others in that group. Is there someone who is of a different race, gender, or age and as such feels unable to contribute as much as others in team discussions? Could you be the ally the person needs to encourage them? Have you noticed any signs of discrimination based on differences? Could you step up and speak up?"

Are your beliefs and views about other people right and truly reasonable \u2013 or are they just a product of your lived experiences? It is important to really keep an open mind when reflecting on this because these biases are outside our conscious awareness and control. Unconscious bias affects everyone. There are several types of unconscious bias that could be experienced at work. This Bulletin article gives some good examples of unconscious biases and how to avoid them in the workplace."
