This is \u00a3250 over the threshold of \u00a32,083 (\u00a32,333 minus \u00a32,083 is \u00a3250). Therefore, your repayment is 9% of \u00a3250 (\u00a3250 multiplied by 9 and divided by 100) which is \u00a322.50. This is rounded down to the nearest pound, so you would repay \u00a322 each month on your student loan."
