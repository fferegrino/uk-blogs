            "text": "We know too that effective teachers also think carefully about the order in which they teach topics. They consider what apprentices and learners need to learn securely to perform specific tasks at work. Construction apprentices, for example, need a good knowledge of maths \u2013 how to calculate area and volume, for instance \u2013 before they can order materials. Beauty therapy apprentices need knowledge of anatomy and physiology before they can design and carry out appropriate courses of treatment. Our evidence shows that good teachers across the sector plan and order the curriculum to ensure success and enable learners and apprentices to build their knowledge, skills and understanding on firm and useful foundations over time."
