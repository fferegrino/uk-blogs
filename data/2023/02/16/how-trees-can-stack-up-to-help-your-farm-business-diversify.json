Figures taken from Farmers Weekly [note 1] and Andersons Ltd [note 2]\u00a0show that in the past year farmers have experienced a 42% rise in sale prices of their produce but their costs have increased by 79% over the same period. This has resulted in many farms being 37% worse off.\u00a0\u00a0"

And while being a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019 may be better than the master of one, perhaps the overriding aim is to become the \u2018jack of all trades and the master of one\u2019.\u00a0"

This in turn further improves the quality of the adjacent profitable land, allowing for reduced inputs without compromising crop yields or stocking densities. By providing shelter, trees can reduce crop losses from wind damage and offer livestock shelter in winter months and shade during hot weather.\u00a0\u00a0"

The farmer advised he was almost able to go a full year without bringing his cattle inside because the land was no longer being poached (the physical breakdown of soil structure under heavy animals) in the winter and the trees offered sufficient shade and shelter to the livestock, thereby reducing feed and bedding costs. In addition, the management of the trees offers sufficient woodchip to heat the farmhouse all year-round, and would no doubt be sold locally if it were not for the installation of their biomass boiler.\u00a0\u00a0"

The farmer has invested in a flock of chickens that could roam the woodland and pastureland based on evidence [note 3]\u00a0that shows chickens are less stressed and produce more and higher quality eggs when in a woodland environment. The chickens also feed on the insects and larvae occupying the soils, grasses, and dung. This helps to reduce livestock insect irritations such as flystrike and mastitis thereby reducing farm inputs, while also producing sufficient eggs to sell locally \u2013 up to eight dozen a week during peak season. All this has improved the financial viability of the farm whilst reducing the farm\u2019s inputs.\u00a0"

The planting of small coppices of woodland has allowed pigs, chickens, and native rare breed cattle to remain outside all year round, with produce sold at a premium price to local farm shops and high-end restaurants. The improved flora is now a feeding ground for bees from the twelve hives they manage on the farm. While during the summer months, one of the fields is used as a small campsite for 28 days of the year, with campers now in the market for locally produced firewood, honey, eggs and meat.\u00a0\u00a0"

For example, having a nearby community helps with the sale of farm produce, whilst a flat field with good public rights of way and some washing facilities makes for a better campsite location. Not every farm has all of these, but by speaking to your local Business Development Advisor they can help identify potential tree planting schemes that align with your objectives.\u00a0"
