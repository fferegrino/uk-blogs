The ONS's unique focus, however, goes beyond just utilising data effectively. The organisations ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive picture of life in the UK by providing timely and robust statistics. This information empowers governments, businesses, and individuals to make informed decisions and plan for the future."

This improvement has led to a significant reduction in the time it takes for the data to become available and be published in the ONS's Faster Indicators Bulletin, now taking approximately two weeks less. This means that data users and policymakers now have access to timely and accurate information on traffic flows, allowing them to make more informed decisions."

This data was particularly valuable for economists and other experts to analyse the impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the UK economy."

By utilizing the Cloud Run service offered by GCP, we were able to take advantage of its ability to run software packages with ease. The Python package for the Road Traffic Sensor RAP runs smoothly on the GCP Cloud Run service, allowing our team to focus on writing and improving the code, rather than managing server infrastructure. Additionally, the cost-effective nature of Cloud Run means that we only pay when the package is in use, providing a cost-saving solution for our organisation."

            "text": "If you're looking to run your application on the cloud, using Cloud Run is a great option. But in order to use Cloud Run, your application needs to be in a special format called a container. One popular way to create this containerised version of your application is through a tool called Docker. When using Docker, developers can create a file called a Dockerfile, which helps organize their code and files in a way that makes the application self-contained and ready to run on the cloud."

            "text": "Let's imagine that building a containerised application is like building a house. Just like how raw materials like brick, tiles, and timber are needed to build a house, our Python package containing scripts and files is needed to build our containerised application."

            "text": "Deploying code to the Cloud using tools like GCP and Docker is certainly a convenient and efficient process. However, it's important to remember that this is just one aspect of the overall software development process. To build and maintain a robust and high-quality codebase, it's essential to adhere to best practices and utilise the right tools. For this reason, we highly recommend checking out the \"Quality assurance of code for analysis and research\" online book, written by the Quality and Improvement team at the Office for National Statistics. This book delves into important topics such as version control, modular code, unit testing, and peer review, all of which were crucial to the development of our Road Traffic Sensor RAP package."
