The SWOT mission will use high-resolution altimetry data to survey at least 90% of Earth\u2019s surface water to help further our understanding of climate change, and to help us predict and mitigate flood risks."

            "text": "The UK has a strong record of participation in the collaborative missions required to establish EO data from satellites and has contributed to the SWOT mission. On the engineering side, part of the innovative radar instrument was made by UK technology company Honeywell with funding support from UKSA. On the academic side, co-funding from UKSA and the Natural Environment Research Council is supporting research to calibrate and validate the SWOT satellite data with in-situ measurements in the Bristol Channel (read more)."
