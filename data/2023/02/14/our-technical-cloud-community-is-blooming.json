            "text": "I recently had a fantastic opportunity to join a panel at the Gov ICT Conference in London, where I spoke alongside colleagues from across government and the private sector about some of the challenges facing us today when it comes to digital transformation. It highlighted a lot of things, including how change in this space is not just about technology. If we want to change the way that we work and how we make the best use of digital solutions, then we need to look both at the technology we provide and the culture we build around it."

            "text": "We are making huge strides in the use of new solutions and emerging technology with particularly great things happening on Cloud, as Phil mentions below! What I think comes next is a deeper understanding of digital at all levels, so that we can use these gains to their best advantage. The DDaT profession has recently grown by 12% with almost 2,200 new colleagues. This is starting to lay the foundations for accelerating delivery in the future."

            "text": "In recognition of this, when we published the government's new digital and data strategy, \u2018Transforming for a Digital Future\u2019 in June 2022, we set out plans within it to build a \u2018system that unlocks digital transformation\u2019. This means tackling systemic barriers like the way we issue funding and how we work with other professions such as policy and commercial. We have begun building even stronger ties with colleagues in these areas, partnering with HMT on updates to budgeting guidance and working with the policy profession on exemplars of multi-disciplinary digital and policy teams. I can\u2019t wait to see what comes next!"

This means sharing code, design and patterns. To do this we are pursuing a plan to build \u2018open\u2019 repositories, which our community (and others) can draw upon when developing solutions, saving time and pain when developing Cloud solutions in government."

            "text": "There are examples outside government we can look to for inspiration, for example all of Google\u2019s code is open for read access, right across their organisation. This means people can copy, improve upon or comment upon code which exists today, speeding their own development and in turn providing\u00a0 feedback on existing code, helping to improve the entire\u00a0 enterprise."
