This means you can use the prototypes you build to do realistic testing with users, on their own devices, and using any assistive technology such as screen readers. In short, it makes it easier for departments to build better digital services."

            "text": "Testing with prototypes before building full production services saves time and money. It lowers the risk of spending money building the wrong thing and therefore also reduces failure demand (the demand created by failing to do something correctly). Building prototypes using the Kit also takes much less time than building production ready services only to have to change them.\u00a0"

They said the new features make prototyping easier and more efficient, as they help users get started more quickly and easily, without necessarily needing to find the relevant documentation. They also said that these changes make it more intuitive and easy to use, particularly for people new to the Kit or new to coding."

Because of this we feel confident that the decisions we made based on the research have been influenced by a mix of perspectives, based on all of our user types."
