            "text": "The report was based on samples taken as part of routine wildlife surveillance over the last year which detected the presence of H5N1 influenza of avian origin in 5 foxes and 4 otters. We cannot determine with certainty whether influenza of avian origin was the sole cause of death in these wild animals and it is possible other factors may have contributed."

The mammals we test for avian flu are all at a high risk of infection,\u00a0 for example the deceased animal may have been found in the close vicinity to a large number of wild bird dead birds caused by bird flu."

            "text": "Scavenging mammals that will be opportunistic and predate on infectious dead or sick birds will be exposed to very large quantities of virus. That gives a possibility for the virus to enter a host population that it doesn't normally maintain in."

            "text": "There is a very low likelihood of any widespread infection in GB mammals and the evidence\u00a0 does not suggest that \u2013 we are talking about isolated incidents where mammals have come into very close contact with the virus. Infection of mammals with influenza of avian origin remains uncommon and the risk of the H5N1 strain to non-avian UK wildlife remains low."

            "text": "The UK has some of the toughest biosecurity measures in the world, and we have taken swift action to protect flocks from the threat of bird flu. All poultry and captive birds\u00a0must be housed in England\u00a0until further notice. Bird keepers are required to shut their birds indoors and implement strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the threat of avian influenza, regardless of whatever type or size. Introducing these steps on farm is the most effective way in reducing the risk of disease spreading."
