What are you doing to support people to make the right decisions when faced with ethical risks and challenges? Does your organisation have trusted ways for people to raise their concerns when things \"just don\u2019t feel right\"? These are just some questions posed by my committee today to public sector leaders and those delivering public services across the UK."

But people don\u2019t operate in a vacuum; organisations can hinder or facilitate ethical behaviour, which is why organisational culture is so important."

            "text": "To some, this may seem like soft stuff coming from a standards body but the evidence we received from business and public sector leaders said having shared values and helping staff live up to them is critical to the success of every organisation. An approach which focuses only on compliance is a missed opportunity. While rules and codes are important, leaders also have the opportunity to galvanise and empower the people in their organisations to aim high, tapping into public service ethos that attracts many to a career in the public sector. Standards matter \u2013\u00a0to the quality and fairness of decision making, to business success, to stable government and to our country\u2019s reputation internationally. We heard how a values-driven culture aids organisational risk management, attracts the highest-calibre workers and supports the delivery of public services \u2013 and that good practice can be implemented without a\u202flarge\u202fbudget."

In some cases, this came about following a\u202fcrisis and in others,\u202fa realisation that\u202fnew systems and processes were needed to support their employees. We share them, not as a\u202f\u2018gold\u202fstandard\u2019 to reach but\u202fas a source of\u202fideas and inspiration."

They need to be underpinned by an organisational culture that values high standards and helps people face the right way when it comes to ethical issues.\u00a0 A shared understanding of ethical values won\u2019t simply happen by accident or osmosis. Our evidence shows that it takes diligence, vigilance and sometimes a great deal of moral courage."

            "text": "Of course, leadership in the public sector can be especially complex. Large projects, serving diverse populations, stewardship of public money and interaction with local and national political imperatives can make for uniquely tricky decision making and conflicting priorities \u2013 which is why the common values set out in the Nolan Principles are so important. They set out what the public expect of those who serve them."
