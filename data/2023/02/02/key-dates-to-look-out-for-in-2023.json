So to make sure we have everything in place we are moving the CS Mid Tier window this year to slightly later in the spring. The window will remain open for the same length of time so anyone that wants to apply should have plenty of time to do so. We are excited about the changes and believe that it will makes things even more straightforward for farmers to apply."

Unlike BPS where making an eligible application generates a payment, for CS the application/agreement and the claim are two separate actions. For ES, if you are offered and accept an extension to your agreement, you will still need to submit a claim for 2023."

This year we have also extended the period in which you can still submit a CS or ES claim, with a reduction, after the closing date of 15 May. This will give farmers more opportunity to receive some payment if they miss the claim deadline, but we would urge anyone with an agreement to get their claim in to us by 15 May."

If you are applying for BPS, you\u2019ll need to email by 2 May 2023 to make sure the change is made in time for your 2023 application. For CS agreements we will continue to work on requests to add land after 15 May. You can read the guidance for this on GOV.UK."
