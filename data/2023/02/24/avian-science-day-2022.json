Although an annual event, the last Avian Science Day was held in 2019, with subsequent events cancelled due to COVID-19. Our desire to have a face-to-face conference led to this year\u2019s conference being held in Birmingham and the meeting was \u2018blended\u2019 with the option to participate using Microsoft Teams."
