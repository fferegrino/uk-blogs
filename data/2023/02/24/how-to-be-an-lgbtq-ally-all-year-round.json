Being a strong ally can just simply be listening to your colleagues, learning about them and the communities they come from. That's not just in the LGBT+ community either, that's generally across the board in the whole spectrum of diversity that makes up our profession and the wider Civil Service."

            "text": "It is important to understand where your colleagues come from. What does their lived experience look like? And how does that affect the way that they work? What positives can it bring to the workplace? But also what are the unique challenges they may be facing and how might this also affect their work? Just listening and engaging with that and just showing that open mindedness is a step in the right direction to being an ally."

Consider this; when you greet your partner outside of work, if you're in heterosexual relationship, how do you do this? Do you use the affection you greet them - hold their hand, kiss them, for example? This isn\u2019t a freedom that homosexual couples necessarily experience."
