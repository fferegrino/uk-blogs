            "text": "We\u2019ve had a lot of interest in the consultation, with many respondents asking questions and providing feedback, so we wanted to talk a bit more about what the changes will and won\u2019t mean for you."

            "text": "One of the challenges of building a way for people to prove their identity online to access government services is that it has to work for everyone.\u00a0 Around 3.5 million adults in the UK don\u2019t have any form of photo ID according to the Electoral Commission, and there are many who don't have a strong credit history on which they can answer questions to prove who they are. The proposed changes would strengthen the legal basis for using government held data to help someone prove who they are, as well as strengthening the legal basis for sharing the result of an identity check with another government department once it has been carried out, so that the user doesn\u2019t have to do it again. This would help more people to be able to prove their identity online, simply and efficiently."

We talked about it in the consultation to help bring to life how the legislation could work in the real-world. GOV.UK One Login is a fast and simple way for people to access government services, while maintaining stringent safeguards on user data and protecting against fraud.\u00a0"

Personal data will always be protected in the system and will only be used to support identity verification. It will enable us to confirm that \u201cyes, this is Jaz Bloggs\u201d, making it easier for Jaz to use the government services they need, while also ensuring that fraudsters can\u2019t get access if they\u2019re not who they say they are."

We will continue to comply with data protection legislation and all guidance published by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The principles of \u2018data minimisation\u2019 are applied as set out in UK GDPR, so that only the smallest amount of data needed to prove a user\u2019s identity is processed. GOV.UK One Login also has very strong cyber security and counter-fraud processes in place to uphold privacy, secure data and identify and rapidly respond to threats.\u00a0"
