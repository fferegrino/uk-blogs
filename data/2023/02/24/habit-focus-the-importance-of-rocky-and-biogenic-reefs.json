            "text": "Rocky reefs are subtidal habitats created by outcrops of rock located within the part of the seabed always covered by water. They provide important hard surfaces for a variety of interesting animals to attach to. This includes spectacular pink sea-fans and communities of sponges. Rocky reefs also provide shelter for an array of animals, including commercially valuable fish, lobsters and crabs."

        {
            "text": "Biogenic reefs are physical structures formed by animals. In the UK, examples include reefs formed by Ross worms, blue mussels, honeycomb worms and cold-water corals. Ross worms and honeycomb worms can build networks of tubes that stabilise the seafloor and create complex habitats. Biogenic reefs can support a variety of life, including sponges, fish, lobsters and crabs."

            "text": "Both rocky and biogenic reefs have been identified within our marine protected areas (MPAs) and so it is important that we consider impacts of activities, such as fishing, on these habitats. Reefs support the wider food chain and with the right protection in place, overflow of benefits from MPAs have the potential to support commercial fish stocks across much larger areas. Reefs also provide opportunities for activities such as SCUBA diving and recreational angling. This supports marine businesses all around the country."
