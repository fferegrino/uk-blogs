People often made assumptions that because active treatment was completed, and she had been declared \u201cNo Evidence of Disease\u201d that she was \u2018back to normal\u2019. That was hard for Nikki to navigate. \u201cBecause once you've had cancer, you're never back to how you were before.\u201d"

There is also a cross government Cancer Support group, easily accessible online. Macmillan is a good one for line managers, because it's got the line manager information. People should also be aware that GP and local primary care services can offer support as well."
