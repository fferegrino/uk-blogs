It\u2019s not because I find it too painful or don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s more the fact that despite being painful I only remember certain things clearly. It's that typical blur that you hear people speak of when describing the sudden events that change their life."

I was going over my lines when our headteacher quietly opened the doors and entered the room - my words tapered off as we all looked towards her expectantly. She asked to speak with me and signalled for me to follow her out of the room. For the minute it took to walk from the hall to the school grounds I panicked in my mind about what could possibly be wrong, racking my brain for any behaviour that may have led to me being in trouble."

My heart was pounding now, this was out of the ordinary and it made me nervous for whatever she was going to say. I know she told me that I was no longer going to be staying with my mum, that social services were getting involved, that I couldn\u2019t see my mum until they said so and that I was going to stay with my gran until things got better. I also remember everything I could see becoming distorted and blurry from tears, my gran\u2019s face melted into a mirage and I quickly detached my mind from the whole situation."

Social workers and other professionals I do not remember would come to my gran\u2019s house, sit on the sofa, which was also my temporary bed, and ask me all kinds of questions. I\u2019d give blunt, straightforward responses. They would inspect our living space, review my gran\u2019s ability to care for my brother and I, review our ability to cope and tell me that my mum wasn\u2019t able to be my mum right now but that maybe things would change."

            "text": "Over time I began to get used to this new way of life. Social workers would come and go, many were temporary or covering for someone else. However, I did build a strong rapport with a couple of social workers who were patient and treated me like a child, not just a case. They respected my desire as I grew older to not have as many visits and trusted me, my brother and my gran to evolve how a family naturally would. I think my mum could have been better supported. Her mental health diagnoses were often difficult to understand, and I feel many of the social work staff were not as empathetic as they could have been or well-trained enough to work with her in the way she needed. This definitely had an impact on me."

Ultimately I learned that my family was never going to return to what it once was and that I had to learn to love and appreciate the family that formed. I learned that I was grateful to have been taken into kinship care, meaning my brother and I got to stay together under the custody of my gran."

However, I can acknowledge that without intervention I would not be where I am today. Living with my gran provided me with the stability and security that my mum wasn\u2019t able to provide. It broke my heart to be taken from her, and I think it broke her more, and yet if I had stayed in my mum\u2019s custody then I think we would have been broken by the forces that drove our family apart in the first place."

She knew my gran could continue to raise my brother and I in ways that she couldn\u2019t, and I will always be grateful to them both for being the women who brought me up and made me who I am now. If I could go back in time and live a \u201cnormal\u201d life with my mum, of course I would. However, time travel isn\u2019t possible and I eventually learned to realise that kinship care was giving me opportunity, not taking it away."

I found out about this opportunity through the Drive Forward Foundation who do amazing work to support care leavers achieve their full potential. They first supported me with my mental health by referring me to Richard at Barnardo Counselling, an amazing counsellor who provides a free course of counselling sessions to care leavers. Drive Forward helped me and other care leavers through employment and interview skill sessions to help guide us towards sustainable employment opportunities. This is where I was introduced to the Civil Service Care Leaver Internship Scheme."

It\u2019s been a huge stepping stone, providing me with experience in the civil service, which of course looks great on the CV, but beyond that has provided me with purpose, routine, and a sense of calm that has improved my overall wellbeing. I think the calmness comes from feeling more secure, like I can see my future and can actually look forward to it."
