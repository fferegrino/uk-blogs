We know that our regulatory and enforcement work is key to ensuring that the value nature provides is prioritised and protected."

            "text": "Preventing harm to nature is central to Natural England\u2019s work. We have responsibility for enforcing a number of laws that protect wildlife and the natural environment, mainly relating to planning applications and protected species. The work we do in this area, often alongside other regulators and partners, aims to ensure the value that Nature provides is recognised as a vital element of the economic and social needs of society."

            "text": "Our main aim is to prevent harm and remediate harm to the environment, and we work with landowners and the public to advise, educate and inform, and to reach a shared understanding of the value of protecting nature. However, we will take proportionate enforcement action where required, which could comprise civil sanctions, cautions and prosecutions."

The report covers data from 2018-2022, but due to a range of factors impacting on our work and workforce during this time, we were not able to publish the data relating to our enforcement work. For the purposes of this blog, we\u2019ll focus on the most recent year covered."

            "text": "In 2021-2022, 21 offences were recorded on SSSIs. Most incidents were minor and we resolved these using warning letters. Although the number of warning letters for SSSI offences appears to have continued to decline from previous years, since the Enforcement Team has been in place we have issued more enforcement actions that aim to address harm rather than simply provide advice."

            "text": "For example, in August 2021 Natural England agreed an Enforcement Undertaking (EU) with a landowner at River Mease SSSI, Derbyshire following the unconsented coppicing of waterside willow trees and mechanical removal of in-channel woody material, leading to a reduction in habitat diversity likely to impact the notified fish species including bullhead and spined loach. The Enforcement Undertaking required them to restore the riverbank by allowing the coppiced willows to regrow in addition to reinstating washed river gravels to provide spawning habitat for fish and provide material to support natural processes. Additional compensation included the provision of suitable refuges for the notified fish species to reduce the risk of predation. The use of these undertakings provides an opportunity for offenders to put right the damage they have done or to return to compliance without the need for us to take further enforcement action."

            "text": "Under the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme (WIIS), NE investigates incidents where it is suspected that animals have died from pesticide poisoning. In 2021-22, 441 reports of animal deaths under the scheme were recorded, a decline from the previous year where peaks across total notifications and cases accepted were observed, mirroring increases highlighted by the Wildlife & Countryside link Wildlife Crime Report and the RSPB's Bird Crime Reports for the same period. This peak is likely a result of the increase of reports from members of the public, linked to changes in the use of natural environment during the global pandemic. 258 cases were rejected on the basis that pesticides were not thought to be involved, and 183 cases were accepted into the scheme."

The caution involved a company in Warwickshire following their failure to correctly install and maintain amphibian exclusion fencing and a failure to deliver mitigation habitat as required by their licence in 2019/20."
