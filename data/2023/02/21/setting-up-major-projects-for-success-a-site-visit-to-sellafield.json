With an annual government funded budget of over \u00a32 billion, Sellafield represents around two-thirds of the total annual spend by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) who are charged with cleaning up the UK\u2019s earliest nuclear sites. The NDA\u2019s mission is to overcome the challenges of nuclear clean-up and decommissioning, leaving sites like Sellafield ready for their next use."

The site \u2018Ion Exchange Effluent Plant (SIXEP) Continuity Plant (SCP)\u2019 is one of these projects. Having received approval after its Full Business Case (FBC) just over a year ago, I had the opportunity to visit the site to see its progress and speak to the project delivery team as IPA prepared for its annual gateway assurance review of the project.\u00a0"

It puts into context the challenge for Sellafield to bring together the principles of delivering successful major projects in a remote part of the country."

Acting as the \u2018kidneys\u2019 of the site by filtering out radioactive material, the plant plays a key part in the overall operation. While impressive to see that the plant is still operating 15 years beyond its original design life, demand for its services will remain until 2060. Therefore, new facilities are being built to enable the treatment of liquid effluent (via SIXEP) for decades to come."

They have done this through the Programme and Project Partners (PPP) contract model. Established in 2019, the framework ensures that the project team works to an aligned plan that is developed up front, before decisions are made to commence major works. This is known as their Major Projects Baseline and it includes core information such as scope, detailed design, execution plans and mature cost estimates that sets a high level of confidence from the starting point and reduces the risk of changes later down the line."

The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for SCP, Jeremy Hunt, explained his view of how realistic and robust early planning has helped. \u201cNearly two years into delivery of the Major Project Baseline, the project met its first key milestone \u2026this is largely down to the collaborative way we, with our PPP partners, approached robust engineering design maturity and constructability reviews, to support detailed schedule development and cost estimation.\u00a0The team also incorporated learning from other projects undertaken at Sellafield and benchmarked against national and international infrastructure programmes, to ensure we had a good level of confidence to support the FBC.\u201d"

Through the PPP, Sellafield has acted to embed realistic planning into the delivery, a step change compared to the way it has historically delivered major projects. We will be working closely with the team to see how their delivery model will continually improve and lessons that can help new nuclear infrastructure projects across the industry."
