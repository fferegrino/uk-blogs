I\u2019ve reduced my flights to one a year since 2016, and I haven\u2019t flown at all since 2019. I take trains and drive where I can or have staycations. I\u2019ve reduced my car usage too. I cycle everywhere I can. I got a cargo bike to try and cut out shorter car trips where I was using the car, to take my dogs with me or to pick up heavier things."

I\u2019m going to close the other one up. I\u2019m careful about where the wood comes from too, and I use it conservatively. I am retrofitting and insulating where I can, and I\u2019ve reduced my energy usage where possible"

I changed my broadband provider to Zen internet and have joined Bcorp, the non-profit network.\u00a0 Nowadays, I\u2019m also using\u00a0Ecosia - the search engine that plants trees\u00a0instead of other search engines"

I have an allotment and look after a community orchard. I\u2019ve cut down on meat and dairy, and I buy non-perishables and ethical, environmentally sustainable cleaning products and cosmetics from a zero-waste refillable scoop shop. I also use soap, toothpaste tabs and creams from Lush. I highly recommend Who Gives A Crap toilet paper and I\u2019m using SMOL for laundry and hang dry."
