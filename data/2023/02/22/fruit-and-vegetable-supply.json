This includes removing tariffs on maize imports from the United States which is a key ingredient in animal feed, improved the compensation scheme for farmers affected by Avian Influenza and expanded the seasonal workers visas for the horticulture sector to 45,000 to ensure they have the labour they need. This is alongside wider government support on energy bills through the Energy Bills Relief Scheme."

            "text": "In 2020, the Government carried out a consultation seeking views from farmers and processors in the dairy sector on whether future regulation could be used to strengthen fairness and transparency in the supply chain to ensure farmers are treated fairly. As the consultation responses indicated widespread support for these proposals, we are working closely with stakeholders to develop regulations and intend to introduce legislation later this year. A subsequent consultation was conducted between July and October 2022 exploring issues in the pig sector. We are analysing the responses and considering appropriate next steps. A Summary of Responses will be published in the coming months."
