On visits to care settings and local authorities, most recently in Greater Manchester, I have seen the amazing work of those in the care sector and the impact they have on people\u2019s lives."

            "text": "Data is fundamental to achieving good quality, person-centred care and has the power to transform its delivery. For example, gathering relevant and timely information - and making it readily available - makes it easier for carers to understand and respond to the needs of those they support. At a more systemic level, it helps local authorities make sure there are sufficient and appropriate services to meet local population needs."

In 2021, we published \u2018People at the Heart of Care\u2019, setting out our ambitions for social care over the next 10 years, and in June 2022, we published the Health and Care Data Strategy \u2018Data Saves Lives\u2019, setting out our commitment to improving how social care data is collected, shared and used."

We have released it as a first draft, as we want it to be shaped by everyone touched by social care. To make sure the right data is collected, held, and shared, we are seeking views from you via a feedback form (see the link at the end of this blog), with a finalised publication by the end of 2023."

We can achieve great progress through streamlining and improving data collections, access and driving digitisation. For example, we will undertake a feasibility study to provide recommendations on a new survey of unpaid carers."

It will provide more insight into the wide variety of circumstances, experiences and needs amongst unpaid carers. This is just one example of the many initiatives underway."

I have seen excellent examples of local and regional interactive analysis tools that have transformed how areas monitor performance of services and people\u2019s outcomes, and it is vital that this local data transformation continues."

These updates better reflect local authorities\u2019 responsibilities for care and the Government\u2019s priorities to monitor whether people are achieving good outcomes \u2013 and ultimately, a good quality of life."
