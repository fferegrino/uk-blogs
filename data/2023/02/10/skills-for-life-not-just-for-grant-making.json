If you are racing through the basic course content and finding it straightforward don't worry about that, look for ways to learn more and satisfy your curiosity. Having 20% of your time at work to invest in learning and development is a phenomenal gift and it would be a shame not to use it. One more tip - sometimes the stuff you are doing at work won't line up perfectly with what you are supposed to be learning. Don't be shy to ask your team for opportunities to put your learning into practice.\u00a0"
