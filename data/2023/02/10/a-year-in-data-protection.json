Well I will always look at it through the lens of my team who have for\u00a0 the last 12 months worked hard at becoming a team first and foremost. The Data Privacy and Compliance team was formed in May 2021. The objective was to set up a centralised Data Protection and Privacy function to support the department in all matters relating to Data Protection and Privacy.\u00a0"

To that end we have embedded a comprehensive audit process combined with robust scrutiny of Data Protection Impact Assessments, all whilst operating at pace we have created awareness training specifically for Cabinet Office colleagues, developed roadshows, and lunchtime learnings to help train and develop\u00a0 Data Protection Leads in the department, so they feel empowered and enabled to deliver advice to their parts of the organisation.\u00a0"

This facilitated the creation of a centralised DSAR function for the department enabling us to respond to data requests within deadlines, and have a Cabinet Office view on volumes and clearance times.\u00a0 To up skill DSAR leads we have held monthly workshops, provided one to one training and worked closely with the Government Legal Department and the Data Protection Officer on complex requests."

Unfortunately we were pipped at the post by the CSI-COP Team at Coventry University who are using citizen scientists to review cookies on the web, creating a taxonomy of these to allow people to understand the effect that cookies have on web browsing behaviour. So worthy winners!!"
