There is a real skill in making science accessible for people and translating the concepts into real life.\u00a0 I also had an early interest in environmental issues, and I suspect some of my high school teachers predicted my future career direction long before I did \u2013 one of them used to joke about me running my (very old) car on elderberry juice."

My first job was actually a year-long placement at a steel works \u2013 I did water and air quality monitoring. It was physically hard work at times, but really interesting and a very real world experience. It was a great starting point to seeing some of the practical applications of science. \u00a0\u00a0I started my career at the EA working on delivering our flood risk capital programme, making sure projects are designed and delivered in the most environmentally sustainable way. \u00a0Sustainability covers a broad range of issues, and having a good understanding of the various scientific principles that underpin them has been a really useful skill over the years."

A win for everyone!"

            "text": "In 2021 we carried out and published work led by Dr Lydia Burgess-Gamble that explored the evidence for various habitat types and their carbon sequestration potential. It concluded that nature-based solutions could play an important role in offsetting, but that the scientific understanding of how effective different habitats are is variable."

We\u2019re doing this by modelling a range of offsetting scenarios using a carbon sequestration model.\u00a0 We will use this work to make evidence-based decisions and inform our final approach to offsetting."

            "text": "In parallel with this, we are also developing a carbon protocol to set out how we calculate, record and monitor our carbon sequestration.\u00a0 It\u2019s really important that this approach is grounded in science, because we need to be sure that any sequestration we claim has actually occurred, and that it can be evidenced.\u00a0 The scientific understanding of how much carbon habitats can absorb is evolving all the time, so we expect our protocol to evolve too. \u00a0This work is in early development but the range of scientific disciplines that need to be involved in it is huge \u2013 from carbon and habitats specialists through to experts in remote sensing and satellite monitoring.\u00a0 As the person bringing this all together I\u2019m really enjoying the opportunity to learn about new evidence and technologies. For me that is what science is about - having an open mind, being willing to learn new skills and solving problems."
