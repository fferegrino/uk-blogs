By embracing innovation, continually gaining insight from users and responding quickly to feedback, we\u2019ve built an app that\u2019s scaled at pace and is fast becoming the one-stop shop for Navy personnel looking for support, information and opportunities to grow their careers."

The technology we\u2019ve developed has also been used to create MyNavy\u2019s sister app, MyRAF, which now serves over 45,000 users."
