Since 22 September 2022, the\u00a0Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill\u00a0has been making its way through Parliament. The changes set out in the Bill will improve transparency by making more financial information available to the public. This will help tackle economic crime and provide more information for enforcement agencies. As part of this package of reform, we are streamlining the accounts filing options available to small and micro companies."

During our consultation phase, the accountancy profession, credit sector law enforcement bodies, and some individuals suggested that the current filing requirements do not provide protection as good as the protection provided by incorporation."

            "text": "A small or micro company that prepares abridged or full accounts for its members does not have to file a copy of its profit and loss account and/or the director's report with Companies House. This minimal level of disclosure has the potential to appeal to fraudsters wishing to present a false image of the company."

            "text": "Research published by the Home Office has calculated that the cost of organised fraud to businesses and the public sector in the UK is \u00a35.9 billion a year. Small and micro companies make up most of the register, so any meaningful changes to the quality of the information on the register will impact them. Improving transparency and having better quality information will make it easier to spot fraud when it happens, and will also help to support business growth."

            "text": "The lack of detail in small and micro-accounts has made it impossible to confirm eligibility to file under a specific regime and claim audit exemptions.
