            "text": "Women have played a crucial role in science for as long as humans have been on earth. From the earliest use of herbs in healing, to the discovery of the structure of DNA[1], women scientists have always been pioneers. However, due to outdated views on the intellectual capacity of the \u2018gentler sex\u2019, many women historically were denied the opportunity to gain scientific knowledge. Even for the small minority of women that could access this type of learning due to familial influence and/ or exceptional privilege, their contributions to science often remain relatively unknown."

            "text": "So, it is only fitting that the 11th of February sees the annual celebration of the vast contribution that women and girls have made to the scientific world. Hosted since 2015 by the United Nations, this year\u2019s \u2018International Day of Women and Girls in Science\u2019 focuses on the contribution of women and girls in relation to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Namely, SDG 6 - clean water and sanitation; SDG 7 - affordable and clean energy; SDG 9 - industry, innovation, and infrastructure; and SDG 11 - sustainable cities and communities. The below stories exemplify the inspiring work of women in these areas. They connect across time to highlight womenfolk striving to make the world a better place. From the first woman to publish a book of photography, to girls using science in their activism here in the UK, women are there, at the centre of it all."

Due to her relationship with her father, Atkins received a scientific education, which was very unusual for the time. Her education had a huge impact on her career and led her to work in botany."

Her father\u2019s friendships with inventors William Henry Fox Talbot and Sir John Herschel, led to Atkins being taught about photography and the cyanotype process. By 1843, Atkins was able to apply the cyanotype photographic process to algae (specifically, seaweed) by making cyanotype photograms \u201cby placing the unmounted dried-algae original directly on the cyanotype paper\u201d[2]. The same year that she perfected this process, she self-published her photograms in the first instalment of Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions, and in doing so established photography as an accurate medium for scientific illustration[3]. You can find out more about her in this video and try out some botanical painting techniques that mimic the cyanotype effect."

Flowers works at the intersection of racism and climate justice as her research with the Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute investigated how structural inequalities impact access to sanitation and clean water[5]. She identified two crucial issues \u2013 firstly African American communities were disproportionately affected by poor sanitation; and secondly, that marginalised, poverty-stricken rural communities were more likely to suffer from contaminated water and poor sanitation. These issues combined lead to higher incidences of intestinal parasitic diseases such as hookworm in the African American community. The disease, normally associated with central and southern Africa and Asia, can impair physical and cognitive growth in children, and had been thought to have been eradicated from the US in the early 20th century."

They found that those who lived in London boroughs with high/ illegal air pollution levels had a proportionally higher rate of illnesses and death, with four thousand Londoners dying from air pollution each year. Those that had illnesses related to air pollutions tended to be people of colour or those from deprived communities. Thus, their campaign was born."

Natural England is committed to providing exciting career opportunities for women that are considering \u2013 or are already within science roles. Natural England offers a wide range of opportunities from field to desk. With women working as policy makers, running our National Nature Reserves, or representing the UK at the international marine conferences, gender is not a barrier to scientific work at Natural England. There are currently over 1220 women employed within the organisation, a testament to the ongoing gender equality work.
