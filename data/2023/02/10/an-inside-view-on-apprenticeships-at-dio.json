The visit included a tour of the DIO-managed redevelopment of the site, led by the former DIO apprentice who worked on the project during his apprenticeship. [Crown Copyright/MOD 2023]Did you know DIO has 101 apprentices working and learning in 13 fields, from project delivery to finance and property to human resources? We\u2019re committed to continuing to offer high quality apprenticeships for new and existing staff, and will be recruiting 100 more apprentices in the next financial year."

            "text": "I had a career break from teaching and decided to apply for roles in Project Delivery. My first role in Project Management Office Support gave me a flavour of the variety of areas involved. I knew there was a great deal to learn, and I thought that a more structured approach to this learning would both suit and benefit me. The balance of 20% time learning and reflecting and 80% applying and extending what you are learning is working very well for me."

        {
            "text": "In hindsight, I can say that my early self-training on the job was effective but somehow disjointed; I was learning in snapshots and often without a measure of comparison. The apprenticeship enabled me to understand the bigger picture, the options available and why certain project management choices were better than others. It allowed me to be more reflective and confident and also know when I needed to move on to a more specialised role. I now work in Risk Management."

        {
            "text": "For me, having already spent a lengthy stint in full time education, the choice of embarking on a new degree was not the right one. Because of being new in the role and Project Delivery in general, self-study and passing qualification exams were not my preferred options either, as they would mean simply preparing for passing an exam, rather than expanding my understanding of the new field. The apprenticeship just suited my circumstances, stage in life and preferred ways of learning."

            "text": "I\u2019d always wanted to do some post graduate study and previously cost was the thing that stopped me. I didn\u2019t realise I could do this as part of an apprenticeship so when I saw the Level 7 option I jumped at the chance. I opted for Leadership as I didn\u2019t want to specialise so much I excluded myself from certain roles in the future and Leadership is applicable across a wide variety of positions."

The hardest part was evidencing my existing qualifications. I left school many years ago and had no idea where my exam certificates were."

[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]I get 20% of my in-work time for attending lectures, reading and writing assignments. I\u2019ve had to be flexible to accommodate work meetings but on the whole this is manageable. Some modules have more reading than others so you have to be prepared to put the time in to get the most out of them. I also became a dad partway through my third module so finding the time to do the extra reading became more challenging but I\u2019m finding my way through."
