In fact, we\u2019ve just concluded our Big Conversation where we engaged with over 2,000 stakeholders about the future of the skills system.

It explains apprenticeships, clearly describing how the apprenticeship should look from start to finish. There is also a spotlight on EDI and the benefits to everyone of having a diverse workplace that is welcoming and accepting, put together by our very own EDI network here at IfATE. I would highly recommend anyone interested in apprenticeships to read through and get a greater understanding of the process."
