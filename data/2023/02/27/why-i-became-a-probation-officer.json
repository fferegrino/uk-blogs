            "text": "I studied criminology at university, graduating in 2019. Following this, I worked odd jobs in my home city as I was unsure exactly what avenue to take with my career. I started volunteering with the Prison Advice and Care Trust (Pact), a through the gate support service for prisoners who have just been released from custody. This gave me experience in formulating risk assessments as well as interacting with people involved with the criminal justice system, and most importantly offenders. During this volunteering I applied for the trainee probation officer programme and was accepted."

Nevertheless, the complex individuals that I work with provide a refreshing understanding of how my offender\u2019s think and behave. Offenders will always keep you on your toes in that regard, and so my work as a probation officer is constantly changing."

However, the training is in place to give you the opportunity to learn and develop your skills within professional settings. In turn, making you a more proficient probation officer."

This was initially difficult, as it is hard to build rapport with someone you have never met face to face. However, once restrictions eased and the office was used for appointments more and more, it became considerably easier."

Often in probation we work with people who are struggling with various facets of their life, be it drug addiction, mental health issues or homelessness. So, it is very rewarding to use the opportunity of working with these people to help change the trajectory of their lives."
