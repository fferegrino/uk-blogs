            "text": "Chris: The ability to learn new skills whilst still working full time. My current course also came with a promotion which made it more appealing to move into a tech role and learn the job around gaining a qualification in the subject."

            "text": "Jonathan: The opportunity to be trained as an automation engineer is what most appealed to me, whilst also getting the opportunity to undertake on the job learning that was both relevant to my role and which is helping me to develop my knowledgebase around IT related subjects."

The word \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 summons up the idea of a 16-year-old, fresh out of school, struggling to study and work at the same time. In reality, it couldn\u2019t be further from that. I\u2019m in a new role, learning new skills while completing a qualification. I\u2019m given plenty of time to do coursework as well as picking up the skills for my new role and have been supported the whole way."
        },
        {
            "text": "Jonathan: It\u2019s been similar to what I expected so far. It\u2019s been interesting to learn about subjects such as robotic process automation and business automation workflow. I hope to learn more about security in the future as well."

I\u2019m developing a whole new skillset in a role that\u2019s very different to anything I\u2019ve done before and, as a bonus, I\u2019ll come out of it with a recognised qualification. It\u2019s made my career path much clearer, giving me that tangible goal to work towards."

            "text": "Tom: I was hesitant to apply but I\u2019m so glad I did! If there\u2019s an opportunity you\u2019re interested in then go for it. The support we\u2019ve had has been great, and it opens so many doors. Yeah, definitely go for it."

There are certainly advantages to picking an apprenticeship over a university course depending on the type of learner you are."
