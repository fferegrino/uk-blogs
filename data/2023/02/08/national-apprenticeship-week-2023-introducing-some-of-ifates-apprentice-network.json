IfATE is now leading by example with the creation of an apprentice network, which will help to foster a sense of community and support for our very own apprentices."

I prefer learning on the job and feel I get much more out of applying what I\u2019m learning directly into my role by doing an apprenticeship. I am in the communications team, and they have been a wonderful support. I have been able to go out filming with a colleague working on the digital side of things, allowing me to get a broad sense of what the rest of the team do."

I feel more confident working and learning, as opposed to taking a gap year to find relevant work experience. I found that doing an apprenticeship was better suited in helping me obtain my goals."

Being able to witness the hard work and seeing the progress of all apprentices was extremely beneficial and inspiring. I was able to understand the work conducted here at IfATE first-hand during the very start of my new career. I look forward to achieving my goals, gaining hands-on experience and learning from experts and staff alike."

I enjoy building my skills and gaining knowledge through learning on the job as I can apply my experience in my role to learning opportunities and develop within those. My apprenticeship has given me the opportunity to work with senior staff to develop a deeper insight to HR. This qualification is highly regarded within the HR sector and will benefit my career in the future."
