That means streamlining existing services to eliminate manual processing, strengthening our digital capabilities, better equipping civil servants to use data, and replacing cumbersome and costly legacy technology - including systems used for key public services - with modern infrastructure."

We\u2019re working to embed single service owners, better performance data culture and increase the prevalence of cross-functional teams. For example, in the Home Office, we're bringing policy, operations and DDaT skills together to collaboratively design and deliver policy outcomes through our Digital Pathway initiative; at the Department for Education we\u2019re embedding digital, data and technology leads and their service teams into all policy teams; and CDDO is working with colleagues across government to build a \u2018digital readiness check\u2019 to ensure that new legislation can be implemented through digital means.\u00a0"

This improves the discoverability of our data, enabling civil servants to understand what data exists that meets their business and service needs. Alongside this, the Chief Data Officer Council has been shaping a common data ownership model which sets out the core responsibilities and roles to support consistent data governance. Our API Catalogue, which helps users find and access data exchanges, continues to grow, with registered APIs increasing by 15% in the last six months. Furthermore, we\u2019ve developed a Data Maturity Assessment for government which helps departments understand their capability, effectiveness and readiness to use data to deliver their priorities, and helps identify areas for improvement.\u00a0"

We\u2019ve rolled out a single Microsoft 365 blueprint to improve interoperability and collaboration across departments, and are partnering with the Grants Management function to create a cross-government approach to grants management. We\u2019ve launched a legacy IT risk framework that is enabling us to identify and assess the highest risk legacy systems across government and ensure funding is prioritised accordingly - including the \u00a32.6bn allocated at the last Spending Review. Alongside this, we\u2019ve seen a number of remediation programmes reach key milestones, for example in Defra and HM Courts & Tribunals Service. Through the Chief Technology Officer Council, we\u2019ve begun to more systematically capture the benefits of emerging technology with quarterly \u201cInnovation Days\u201d in partnership with external organisations at the frontier of new technologies. Meanwhile work on our Mobile App Strategy has just begun, in partnership with GDS.\u00a0\u00a0"

We\u2019ve widened the roll out of our pay framework to departments, with 28 departments now onboarded, ensuring we can pay more competitive salaries for scarce technical skills. We\u2019ve also trained hundreds of senior government executives on Digital, Data and Technology Essentials, both through central programmes and department-specific ones, such as HMRC\u2019s Spotlight on Digital Learning and the MoJ\u2019s Innovation Month. In addition, we\u2019ve further strengthened our DDaT profession through a Software Developer Graduate Programme, grown our Apprenticeship community through initiatives including at the Department for International Trade, and added new competencies to our professional frameworks, such as crucial Accessibility and Assurance roles."
