After qualifying I discovered a small but passionate team looking after ecology on the Ministry of Justice estate, I volunteered for them as well as working in the prison and eventually it led to me getting a job in the MoJ Sustainability Team\u2026 I truly found my niche!\u00a0"

Only last week, I gazed out of my office window (or corner of my son\u2019s bedroom while I work from home) only to see a white-tailed eagle flying past. What a magical sight.\u00a0 In my excitement I tried to record it using my phone but ended up pressing the wrong button!\u00a0 My kids also spotted a common shrew building its nest in our garden recently, it was so preoccupied with carrying the leaves I managed to capture get some wonderful slow-motion videos of it."

Staff networks make a significant contribution to the Civil Service\u2019s strategic aspiration to be the UK\u2019s most inclusive employer. They inform how we increase representation and create a more inclusive culture to ensure we become the brilliant Civil Service we aspire to be and a great place to work."

Back then, we believed that there was an as yet un-connected community of civil servants who loved nature and wanted to express their values about nature both at work and as well as at home. When the lockdown struck just only a few months later, that belief proved more timely than we could have ever imagined."

We recognised the importance of biodiversity in nature to ensure a healthy environment as well as the importance to the Civil Service of cultivating a diverse and more inclusive workplace."

Our dedicated Committee members volunteer because we believe in nature, and we believe in the power of staff networks."
