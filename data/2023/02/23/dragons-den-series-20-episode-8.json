I\u2019d describe it as a pair of clam-like scoops mounted on sticks. Simple but brilliant! \u00a0"

The clothing is designed to help people with physical challenges (think stoma bags, feeding tubes, catheters, wheelchair users) dress comfortably and practically, yet fashionably."

The Unhidden brand could still remain operative as part of the agency offering."

            "text": "Clothing designers like Victoria can consider registering their designs. This would cover the appearance, the physical shape, the configuration and any decoration. The registration gives exclusive rights for up to 25 years. If someone were to copy or steal a design, this would make legal action more straightforward. Even if a designer chooses not to register their design, they may still have automatic unregistered rights."
