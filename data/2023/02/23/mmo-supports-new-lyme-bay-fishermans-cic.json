            "text": "For most of my 20 years working in and around the fishing industry, small vessel representation has been the elephant in the room. From Defra to MMO, and the MCA to Seafish, but particularly across the sector, it has long been understood that large swathes of the inshore fleet have no meaningful representation."
        },
        {
            "text": "That is not to say there is none. Some producer organisations, and specialist organisations like the South Devon & Channel Shell fishermen, do a good job of representing all their members, but on the whole, thousands of owner-operators around the coast simply don\u2019t belong to groups that offer them support, or someone to represent them."
        },
        {
            "text": "But I have, in recent years been encouraged that this gap in representation has been talked about more openly in ports and harbours and on social media. Government organisations are also actively trying to engage better with skippers and owners, with more coastal pop-ups during consultations and workstreams \u2013 but the industry must also play its part."

            "text": "For five years I had worked as the fisheries liaison to Lyme Bay for the Blue Marine Foundation. This put me in weekly contact with a lot of the fishermen across the four ports of Beer, Axmouth, Lyme Regis and West Bay. They gave up their time throughout,\u00a0 and continue to fill my personal knowledge gaps."
        },
        {
            "text": "Time and time again I heard about things that were \u2018happening to them\u2019. Sometimes fishermen didn\u2019t even know about changes before they happened, let alone engage in designing these policies when they were being developed."
        },
        {
            "text": "Frustration was commonplace. The pivotal moment for most of us came when senior Defra officials and their team came to visit for a couple of days in 2019. They told me they wanted face-to-face, no-holds-barred discussions, and my fishermen were up for the task! We met in backrooms of pubs and cafe\u0301s in the ports, and the discussions were lively."
        },
        {
            "text": "But what planted the nugget was how much the officials got out of it. There were of course things they had heard before, but some individual experiences and issues that fishermen raised had not been cutting through to their level. I picked up from them how vital to good policy this type of information is, but it took a while to work out how we could achieve that on a permanent basis, to get those voices in the room heard by those taking decisions."
        },
        {
            "text": "Everyone thought it was a great idea to try to form a representative body from across the four ports, and find funding to help staff and advocate for the local fleets. We knew what was needed, but there wasn\u2019t a template for doing it."
        },
        {
            "text": "Blue Marine Foundation was keen to help support the local fleets to set up their own organisation \u2013 by fishermen, for fishermen. We are grateful for its support in this journey, and for allowing me to work with the fishermen to help set this up."
        },
        {
            "text": "It was really important to me that this organisation was truly representative, and the fishermen felt the same way. Everyone knows how difficult it is to get more than three fishermen in a room at the same time, but when you can, the ideas flow and the passion for this industry is palpable."
        },
        {
            "text": "So this journey progressed through 2021, with lots of one-to-one conversations with fishermen on quaysides. All four ports have ad hoc fishing organisations, and they too sat and talked through what this new organisation might look like, and what its goals and aspirations should include."

What ensued was a day of back and forth discussing structure, goals, and the routes to them, and the plan was hatched and honed."
        },

            "text": "The day-long workshop resulted in a report that was circulated to all who attended for approval, and the real journey then began. From registering the CIC at Companies House to tax and VAT registration, opening bank accounts and preparing bids, it has been full steam ahead."

None of us had set up a CIC or used FaSS for this type of project before \u2013 even opening bank accounts for a CIC is not as simple as you might think! So we want to share all our documents, from the workshop agenda and output report through to the details of our FaSS bid, so that others can literally cut and paste the things they like and want to do, and not have to go through the hard yards we did."
