            "text": "PFAS \u2013 also known as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 - represent a group of thousands of chemicals, with hundreds used commercially across many sectors of industry and society. There is increasing evidence of the occurrence of PFAS in the environment and, once in the environment, PFAS are extremely persistent. This means we will continue to detect them for many years, despite restrictions."

            "text": "There is also growing concern regarding the risks to human health. Through UK REACH, Defra asked the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to examine the risks posed by PFAS and develop a 'Regulatory Management Options Analysis\u2019, which will set out further options for managing the risks of PFAS chemicals. This is due to be published by the HSE in the spring."

            "text": "Work is underway across government to help assess levels of PFAS occurring in the environment, their sources and potential risks to inform future policy and regulatory approaches. We are developing a cross-government Chemicals Strategy to frame the work we are doing across chemicals which will put us on a path for improved chemicals management. It will set out our priorities and principles for taking regulatory action to protect human health and the environment."
