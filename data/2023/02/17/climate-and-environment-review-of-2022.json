Even if nationally determined contributions are implemented in full, the paper warns that temperatures would still rise 2.4\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the year 2100."

This could result in millions more people experiencing extreme heatwaves, droughts and exposure to climate risks and poverty."

COP27, held in Egypt in November, resulted in a historic agreement to form a \u2018loss and damage\u2019 fund. This aims to compensate lower income countries, who did little to cause the climate crisis but are heavily exposed to its impacts, using funds from richer countries who were responsible for large historical emissions."

            "text": "In the UK the Climate Change Committee\u2019s 2022 progress report to Parliament stated that the UK government has a solid net zero strategy, in line with the Paris Agreement, in place. However, it also identified challenges in achieving these ambitious targets which will need to be addressed in future years."

The bill pledged almost $370bn into renewables, electric vehicles, heating and greater efficiency. In Australia emission reduction targets were significantly increased from 26% to 43% of 2005 levels by 2030."
