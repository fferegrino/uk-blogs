            "text": "I then went to Egypt for four years and returned in January 2020. I started working at Royal Star & Garter in March. I met some of the residents and thought it was an incredible place. I began working there at the start of the pandemic, which proved really difficult as I didn\u2019t know the residents that well, but I could tell how much it was affecting them not being able to see their families. It was heart-breaking."

But then I go over it again and it becomes clear. This week, I understood everything at university and some of what I learnt I relayed back to my colleagues in the home, so the course isn\u2019t just helping me, it\u2019s helping them to provide better care too."

The students I\u2019m with at university all have different backgrounds and I love hearing their stories and what they do. It\u2019s nice to see and hear different aspects of the health and social care sector because every setting is different and I\u2019m excited to sample the other working environments."

Seeing how they have grown in confidence over the past two years is so inspiring. The home manager and all the staff have been so supportive \u2013 if I have down days, they\u2019re there to pick me up."

I\u2019ve found a job that doesn\u2019t feel like a job \u2013 it feels like a happy family and it\u2019s so nice."
