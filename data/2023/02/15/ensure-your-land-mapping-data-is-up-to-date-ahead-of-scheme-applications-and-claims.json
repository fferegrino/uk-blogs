This is also important as farmers need to ensure their digital maps correctly show the agricultural land parcels on their holding to apply for, or claim, rural payments. If the data on the RLE1 form is inaccurate or incomplete, or sketch maps are incorrect or missing, this can lead to mapping change delays."

When you send your RLE1 form to RPA to make mapping changes to your registered land, it\u2019s important you send accurate sketch maps for each of the mapping changes. You should use your sketch maps, alongside aerial photography and Ordnance Survey maps where possible, to mark up and annotate your mapping changes, rather than the RLE1 form."

If the digital maps don\u2019t show all your land correctly, you can make changes by filling in an RLE1 form. An RLE1 form also needs to be used to register a land parcel for the first time.
