When I was first appointed, I was still Chief Executive of Disability Right UK; and I have always worked to bring evidence of disabled people\u2019s experience into the work, not least by engaging on specific projects and issues with Disabled People\u2019s Organisations, claimants, umbrella organisations and disability policy experts. \u00a0"

We look at how equality impacts have been addressed \u2013 and ask questions of officials on, for instance, which groups of people will be most affected and what data is available to illuminate that.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "I have learnt a huge amount from the tremendous expertise of fellow Committee members, ranging from detailed legal academic knowledge to wider policy and strategic thinking. It is that range of knowledge and skills that makes for very high-quality discussions, everyone challenging and learning from each other. And through those debates, and through questioning officials (from policy, analytic and operational teams) so we are really clear on the proposals, we reach conclusions and advise government on ways to improve regulations, before they are laid before Parliament or implemented. During my time we have advised on regulations on everything from young people\u2019s housing allowances to Universal Credit earnings thresholds; from Personal Independence Payment mobility allowances to the large-scale move to Universal Credit. This type of scrutiny can really improve policy. We advise, Ministers decide \u2013 so not all of our advice is accepted, but sometimes we find that even if the advice is not immediately adopted, it is implemented down the line. \u00a0"
