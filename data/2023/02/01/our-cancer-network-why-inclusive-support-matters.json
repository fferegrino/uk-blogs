Bami is an ambassador for this magical place. It provides a home from home \u2018kitchen table\u2019 safe space, to catch your breath and talk to someone who really understands cancer."

The internet was barely a thing (I\u2019m ancient) and podcasts were the stuff of \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s World\u2019 (see, told you I was ancient). I guess there was the occasional cancer related storyline in a TV show \u2013 but there was no diversity across the piece and certainly the concept of \u2018dying well\u2019 or \u2018living well\u2019 with cancer was unheard of."
