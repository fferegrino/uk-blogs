On a sunny January morning cattle graze amongst loud bangs, armoured vehicles move noisily over buried prehistoric remains and soldiers train near where people might be walking, driving, cycling or horse riding."

As Commandant I\u2019m responsible for accommodating, feeding and looking after training troops in our three camps. I\u2019m also the Senior Training Safety Officer for SPTA and me and my team make sure that the training area and ranges are maintained so that they are safe and sustainable for both military users and the public, who use the area for recreational purposes."

At any one time up to 40 units can be out on the Plain, that\u2019s around 4250 soldiers that can be training at once. At the same time the rich grasslands found here are home to a variety of wildlife, including butterflies, bumblebees and other insects, as well as birds such as the stone curlew, barn own and harrier."

I have a legal statutory requirement to look after the grasslands and these are partly maintained by grazing. Areas of land are grazed in temporary pennings that can be moved. Grazing restrictions are applied to areas important to wildlife.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fine balancing act meeting the needs of the farmers and the training troops, but it works."

[Crown Copyright / MOD 2022]My favourite place on the Plain is Copehill Down Village. It\u2019s a purpose-built urban training facility that has been in existence for 36 years. It\u2019s designed to replicate a village so that personnel can practice attacking and defending on various levels. It\u2019s the largest urban training facility on the UK Defence Training Estate. It\u2019s been upgraded recently and it\u2019s so versatile that it can be adapted at short notice to meet the unique training needs of both UK and overseas troops. There are lots of stories hidden within its walls and having trained here myself it brings back lots of memories."

A long and deep history spans the ages. SPTA is home to a wide range of heritage starting way back in prehistoric times: a Paleolithic bi-faced axe, an Early Iron Age to Late Bronze Age midden and a collection of Roman villages have all been found here, and it\u2019s also the site of a Battle of Britain Spitfire crash. DIO plays an important role in conserving, maintaining and preserving this important national heritage across SPTA and the wider Defence estate."
