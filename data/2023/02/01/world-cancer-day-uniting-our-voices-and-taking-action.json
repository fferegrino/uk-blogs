In October for example, we hosted a conversation with Dame Lynne Owens about her recent cancer diagnosis and treatment and the impact this had on her both in-and outside work. The event attracted nearly 1,000 attendees and we were inundated with positive feedback and requests to join the network."

We\u2019re delighted to announce some fantastic guest speakers this year, including Professor Sir Chris Whitty, Cathy Brokenshire (widow of minister James Brokenshire), and Dawid Konotey-Ahulu CBE. Join us via Eventbrite - it would be great to see you."

If we were all to commit to one action this World Cancer Day, and to support the Working Through Cancer Network \u2013 perhaps attending a cancer awareness session, signing up to be a blood or stem cell donor, or becoming a disability ally to colleagues affected by cancer \u2013 imagine the impact we will have across the public sector and beyond!"
