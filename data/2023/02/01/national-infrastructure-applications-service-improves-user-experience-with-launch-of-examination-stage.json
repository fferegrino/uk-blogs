We have taken an agile, phased approach, replacing small elements of the website at a time whilst keeping the existing website as a launching point to the new elements. This allows us to release and iterate faster whilst minimising risk."

            "text": "In April 2022 we launched our new \u201cregister to have your say\u201d journey which allows users to submit a relevant representation and become an interested party at the pre-examination stage. The new-look relevant representation journey has simplified the task for users into bite-sized chunks in easily understandable language to meet accessibility standards."

We also continue extending this to new national infrastructure applications in England. Once we have the full service in place we will begin translation work to extend the service to Welsh projects."

We have launched the documents and examination timetable pages and the new \u201chave your say\u201d journey which allows users to make their submissions against examination deadlines. These new pages are being trialled on the Drax Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage Project. They have been developed over months through detailed user testing, design and development. We will also continue to iterate these in response to user feedback."

This will provide a better experience for people who use screen readers, and will enable people new to taking part to fully engage with the application process. The new \u201chave your say\u201d journey also ensures that submissions are made against the relevant deadline item(s), simplifying their collation and so improving efficiency."

For instance, we are committed to increasing the number of documents visible per page, to make the location of the examination library more prominent, and to reintroduce the search by date filter to the documents page. The team are working hard on these revisions, amongst others, which will be released in due course."

Many of the future improvements to the website we have in store are dependent on the new functionality that will come with this work, so watch this space."
