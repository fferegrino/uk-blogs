My passion for apprenticeships comes from seeing the great success that they can help people achieve in their lives and careers. They give you the chance to change direction, to grow within your role, and to learn new skills. "

I was concerned it would be a distraction from my job. However, I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! Study time was ring fenced \u2013 every Friday was dedicated to my coursework. Moreover, colleagues were supportive and helpful when I asked for support with assignment-based activities such as recorded conversations or witness statements."

Because my last one was so successful, I jumped at the chance. Apprenticeships are an excellent way to get recognised and acquire useful qualifications whilst still doing your job. My next one includes a Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) certificate \u2013 an industry benchmark that is recognised within the private sector and the Civil Service."

It was a great experience navigating my way through digital projects as an associate and dabbling in the world of a Project Management Office (PMO) as a Project Support Officer (PSO). I developed my passion for project management and leadership and actively looked for opportunities to further my career."

My apprenticeship gave me a good base from which to build, and I have worked across multiple, complex, yet exciting projects. I have experienced different roles and worked on some pretty amazing things."
