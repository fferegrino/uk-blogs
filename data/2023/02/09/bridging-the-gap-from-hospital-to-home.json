            "text": "Convalescent homes were a common aspect of the health care system from the mid-nineteenth century until the 1980\u2019s. They supported individuals to recuperate, following a stay in hospital. By focusing on nutrition, hydration and general health and well-being they enabled individuals to return home when they were fully rehabilitated."

            "text": "They were often in locations which could be considered \u2018therapeutic\u2019, for example, close to the coast. This was an approach which predates the models of person-centred care we know today, where the link between emotional, physical and mental well-being is now well established."

            "text": "It could not be more relevant to the challenges we are experiencing across the whole health and social care system in 2023. We need to be putting the person at the centre of care and focusing on long-term outcomes, rather than short-term fixes."

            "text": "People are living longer, advances in medical interventions for complex health conditions requiring longer term support models and increased customer expectations. That combined with reduced living standards, health inequalities and the impact of COVID have seen the pressure on the NHS and social care increase past breaking point."
        },
        {
            "text": "We know that recruitment is a national issue and there are many delayed transfers of care due to domiciliary care shortages. The evidence suggests lack of activity in hospital leads to reduced functional ability, deconditioning, as well as the worsening of cognition, particularly in older people. These are all major factors that can prevent discharge and increase reliance and pressure on social care."

        {
            "text": "We regularly receive admissions with people who were continent on admission and return catheterised, people who were mobile and return requiring hoist transfers and people who had no pressure damage returning with grade 3 pressure sores. This is not a criticism of health settings; they are not set up to provide holistic outcomes."

            "text": "I am thinking of a \u2018social prescribing plus\u2019 model, where short-term stays are commissioned as part of an admission avoidance strategy and support hospital discharge. During a 7-day period an individual could have a full medication review, maintain good nutrition and hydration, enjoy restful sleep, and encourage daily routines of physical, mental and emotional activity."
