            "text": "This National Apprenticeship Week, we are reflecting on how apprenticeships can help individuals develop the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career. Apprenticeships provide on-the-job training alongside studying, allowing individuals to gain essential workplace skills to aid their career development. Over 700 qualifications are available and the TRA can provide access to them for new entrants as well as those already in the Civil Service."

Sean had no accounting experience prior to working at the TRA, having spent 12-13 years in academic publishing before. Below, he shares his experience and some advice for anyone thinking about embarking on an apprenticeship."

            "text": "Between then and the end of 2022 when I completed my apprenticeship, every other week there were formal lectures covering the course materials we would need to know, which all tied in with the textbook and its structure too. There were three overarching aspects of the apprenticeship: financial accounting, management accounting and accounting for business, all of which had sub-topics that were clearly differentiated. This helped with identifying the areas I needed to brush up on with my revision."

We had access to practice questions and mock exams that helped me to assess my knowledge prior to sitting any formal assessments."

For me and my personal commitments, having the opportunity to focus on my development\u00a0during my working hours has been a huge advantage. It's also a way to\u00a0boost your CV\u00a0and your range of\u00a0experience, and is a really good way to\u00a0broaden your horizons."
