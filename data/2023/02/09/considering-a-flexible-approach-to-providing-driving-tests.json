            "text": "Our existing driving test service is based on a network of driving test centres, often with fixed long term leases. This can result in a test centre being tied to a location where the road and traffic conditions have changed, and no longer provide the best environment to assess a candidate's ability to drive."

We\u2019ve told approved driving instructors about the trials happening at four locations; Birmingham (Kings Heath), Doncaster, Dumfries and Mill Hill (London) to test the concept."

            "text": "By using flexible test locations and routes, DVSA can continue to offer a realistic driving test to candidates as Britain\u2019s roads change and do its part in keeping our roads among the safest in the world. If a learner is truly test ready, they should be able to pass on any roads, not just those which they have practised on. It is one of the reasons DVSA does not publish test routes, to discourage route learning."
