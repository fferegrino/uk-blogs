For example, it is far more likely that internal participants could be recognised from recordings of sessions \u2013 they could even be identified from quotes. They could also be identified through 'jigsaw identification', which is when someone can be identified based on a description of their work. This could potentially make participants feel uncomfortable, especially if you have discussed sensitive or controversial topics.\u00a0"
