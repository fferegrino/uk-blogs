They felt it had been a challenging time for all businesses yet the significant barriers they had to navigate over the past couple of years in the face of the pandemic only served to make The Queen\u2019s Award process a more uplifting and beneficial experience. Samarkand completed the application, and finally, in March 2022, received the incredible news that Her Majesty The Queen had approved the Prime Minister\u2019s recommendation that Samarkand should receive a Queen\u2019s Award for Enterprise.\u00a0\u00a0"

Samarkand was delighted to welcome Piers Storie Pugh OBE TD DL FRGS to their London office to formally present The Queen\u2019s Award. The presentation ceremony, held on July 15th 2022, was a significant milestone for the company and brought the team together. With years of events cancelled and postponed due to COVID still fresh in their minds it was extra special to celebrate in person in the glorious July sunshine. Colleagues from all parts of the business, as well as a special guest, Stephen Hammond MP, joined the celebrations.\u00a0\u00a0"
