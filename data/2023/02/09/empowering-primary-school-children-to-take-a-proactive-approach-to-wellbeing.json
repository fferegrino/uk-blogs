The initial impetus to make a change arose from discussions with a local clinical psychologist and the oversubscription for private mental health services for teenagers locally. Our local consortium of primary schools bid for local authority funding to address this great need from our position in primary schools; it was clear to us that preventative and proactive work was needed to empower our children and prepare them for their teenage years."

Demand was great, with children and families keen to sign up to sessions, resulting in most children in school accessing at least one of the programmes by the end of the second year of roll out."

Our trained \u2018wellbeing ambassadors\u2019 are pupils who lead on and provide a voice for all things mental health and wellbeing, opening up conversations and ensuring relationships are supportive. They have recently set up our intergenerational project which brought together different age groups from across the community to mutually support wellbeing. Events organised have included a conker tournament with tea and cakes, a drop-in session at the parish council and a Christmas Bonanza."

Our preventative approach is vital to empower children with the skills, knowledge and awareness to understand their mental health needs and identify issues early on, and we can see the difference this makes to our pupils. However, it is not only these factors that support happy, settled and confident children prepared for the world ahead of them."

On most days, you can hear the bass of the drummers in our school creating the beat and singing is integral to our learning and helps children commit learning to memory very powerfully. With a self-taught, specialist music teacher, we can focus on a rigorous and carefully planned programme of work to ensure that children can both play and appreciate music and realise all of its benefits."

At the centre of all of this is the power of our staff and the wider community who truly value one another and the contribution of each person\u2019s unique role in making a difference. Our staff create a positive ethos and culture and from there, we build a jigsaw of learning opportunities through our vast curriculum."
