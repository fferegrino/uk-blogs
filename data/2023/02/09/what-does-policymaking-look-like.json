To that end, if academics and policymakers were to describe \u2018the policy process\u2019, could they agree on what it looks like? \u00a0To help answer this question, in this post I\u2019m presenting some commonly-used images in policy research, then inviting you to share images that you would use to sum up policy work."

(1) Policymaker attention to problems does not relate strongly to (a) the size of the problem, or (b) the available information. (2) A lack of attention results - in most cases - in limited change (since high attention may be required to help overcome existing rules and practices)."
