Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and the need for organisational change to support legislative reform, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked hard to retain. A key part of that, I feel, is the sense of fairness and opportunity in the organisation - something that we are keen to maintain and expand."

We also recognise how integral diversity is to inclusive policy making, understanding our customers and widening organisational talent and innovation."

As a team we\u2019re all committed to EDI - championing it and making it a reality. But it\u2019s not just us as the senior team. Leaders at all levels of the organisation need to role model our values and lead the way in promoting conscious inclusion and fair access to opportunities for all colleagues."

In doing this we committed to improving racial equality in the workplace."

Meeting monthly, this group brings colleagues from across the organisation together to identify opportunities for progression, deliver the charter\u2019s calls to action and make sure we deliver against our agreed aims and goals. The group looks to support and challenge current approaches in the organisation and identify gaps within our current practices. We raise awareness of the charter internally and engage with relevant colleagues to make sure that EDI is integral to policy development and service delivery."

From an EDI perspective, it helps to build awareness of how someone experiences Companies House and their career differently, including the barriers they may have faced. It helps to create an inclusive culture where all experiences, skills and ideas are valued and utilised to their full potential."

I\u2019ve been fortunate not to suffer the racism or challenges others have faced and continue to face. But that makes me even more determined to make sure that Companies House is a diverse organisation that celebrates our differences, learns from each other and enables everyone to bring their whole selves to work."
