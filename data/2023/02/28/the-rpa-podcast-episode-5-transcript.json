In today\u2019s programme, I\u2019m delighted to say we\u2019ll be hearing from the RPA\u2019s Chief Executive, Paul Caldwell. Paul will reflect on the successes and challenges of 2022 and look forward to what\u2019s coming up in 2023. It\u2019s an important time of year for the Countryside Stewardship scheme so we\u2019ll be talking through the very latest updates, ensuring you\u2019re prepared for the weeks ahead. Later in the episode we\u2019ll reflect on the recent Environmental Land Management schemes announcements, including the extra Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme standards that will become available this summer. And finally, we\u2019ll be discussing how the Future Farming Resilience Fund is supporting farmers and rural communities across the country and hear how you can take advantage of what the fund has to offer."

This is certainly the case for the RPA\u2019s Chief Executive, Paul Caldwell, and he recently spoke to Andrew Hawnt, from the RPA\u2019s Internal Communications team, about his reflections of 2022 and ambitions for the year ahead."

        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew: Absolutely well said. So I want to know when I came here, I applied to RPA because I was interested in working for an organisation that was making a real, tangible difference with the work we do for the environment and industries, and I thought that was a really positive thing, something I could get behind. What attracted you to the Civil Service and what particularly attracted you to this organisation?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Paul: Well, I'm a career civil servant and I sort of came into this organisation in a round-about way. So I was attracted to the civil service pretty much from school, I read quite a lot about civil service careers because I was interested in science. And I read on the scientific organisations within the Civil Service and was really interested in the kind of different work that they did and in particular the impact on society and making a difference. I came into the RPA via a circuitous route because I lived in Cumbria and the British Cattle Movement Service ran an advert in Cumbria for people to come and join them, and it was a fascinating insight. So I gave it a try. I did it initially on secondment and really got to like it. And then via a number of different events, also including the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, I ended up ensconced in the RPA and have been on a fascinating journey ever since."
        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew: It is a really interesting organisation. I came on to CS apps (Countryside Stewardship Applications) originally, I'm on comms now, but on CS apps, that was such an eye opener. Discovering all the things that the agency did, and it's really fascinating stuff, the depth that the agency goes to, to make sure things are done right is really interesting. So, what would you say some of the challenges and successes of 2022 were and what can we take away from them?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Paul: Well, I think 2022 was the culmination of a lot of what we set out we would do in our strategy. We, as many people know, inherited a number of very challenging circumstances and we committed to putting those right, not always seen by our customers and the public in the best of light. So, we've obviously been on a few years now trying to put that right as determined in our strategy, but particularly in there making ourselves an exemplar of operational delivery and an asset to the department and I think 2022 saw us, through our performance, and there's a saying in sport that you know tables don't lie, our performance speaks its own truth in terms of results, which shows how far we've come. But particularly pleasing was the way in which we've managed to do it. So, we haven't done so by going into crisis mode. We haven't sort of been embattled, we've done so in a way that everybody in the agency has contributed to, through our values, through our way of working, we've created something I believe here that stands us in really good stead, not just having got us through the difficulties of the past, but in really good stead for facing the future. And I think it's a really exciting future. 2023 is when we start to embark on that more fully, but 2022 I think really stood us in that stead. Across the board, we changed the way we did inspections, we've been involved with livestock information transformation, we've been at the centre of Defra's offering on grants, and people have come to realise the extent of expertise and variety of work that we do here. And of course, we've consolidated our Basic Payment Scheme payments and made huge improvements in Countryside Stewardship. So, all of those things that come together, I think that have showed us to be that exemplar that we want to be. We're still got a little way to go and one of the exciting things for 2023 is taking the next step in that journey. But we I think have taken ourselves to that place in 2022, that is less about the past, and more about the future."
        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew: Yeah, absolutely. And you mentioned we're going to face some of these things coming to coming throughout 2023. Could you tell us anything else about what lies ahead for 2023? How are we going to tackle these challenges?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Paul: 2023 for me is when all of the talk turns to action. Everybody is probably familiar with the things that have been said in terms of agricultural transition. One of the things that I frequently reflect on, waking up on the morning after the EU referendum. I think it's fair to say there was an extreme nervousness within the organisation as to what that means for the future, both in terms of the policy that we were responsible for administering, but also in terms of the chosen delivery vehicle and how might we be a part of that. We've come such a long way since then and we've seen all of the plans and we've seen the agricultural transition plan in the public domain. But what we've quietly and successfully done in the past few years is position ourselves in that delivery space in a way that has transitioned us from being the paying agency by right to being the delivery body of choice. And that means we've been at the heart of the Future Farming programme in order to be able to help the department realise that transition and now all of that planning, all of that talking is about to be a reality. This year, we're going to launch the next phase of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which is the sort of, if you like, the meaty bit of it, you know we've kind of dipped our toe in the water and now we're gonna throw ourselves into it and start really swimming. We've got radical plans to change Countryside Stewardship and our ministers have confirmed Countryside Stewardship as a vehicle for the future and not just a legacy scheme. So managing those interfaces and that transition, along with our grants proposition, along with new approaches to regulation, we're gonna get to do all of that this year, which means we're gonna have to be prepared for it, it means we're gonna have to do quite a lot of work to stand it up and make sure we're ready. But it's when it all really comes to life which makes this year a really exciting prospect."
        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew: How do you think the things that we're working on for this year will influence how things will progress, how industry it will progress and how our own work will progress over the next few years?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Paul: I think, firstly, we feel different about ourselves, which is very important in having the confidence to face the future, but I think our stakeholders and our customers have started to feel differently about us. And there's something of a virtuous circle in that because everybody wants to feel that they're doing a good job. You asked me why I came to the Civil Service and you know what I like about this organisation, and making that difference, contributing to those outcomes, knowing that you're helping people to do that. I studied quite a lot of environmental science and like everybody else, it's never been more topical than it is now. And we are able to help people to realise those ambitions, the things that we are seeing on national television, we're a part of and a part of helping the general public, but particularly farmers and landowners, to promote that agenda, and that changes the way that we relate to our customers and I think what we've learned this last 18 months is that we can do that and we\u2019re in a position to do that. We've learned the things that we need to change to be better at that. I think there are ways in which we can improve the relationships, there are ways in which we can improve the technology and the channels that we use to be able to conduct that dialogue. But I think, you know, we've learned a lot about how our customers need support and want us to be available for that support, and perhaps surprised ourselves a little bit in just how well we are placed to provide that support."
        },
        {
            "text": "Andrew: So, here we are early 2023. What is it about RPA and the people in the organisation that right now makes you most proud?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Paul: I think they're actually indistinguishable and synonymous. The people in the organisation are the RPA, that is, you know, what makes me most proud about the RPA is its people and what makes the RPA the organisation it is, is the people in it. What makes me most proud? The fact that people care so much. The fact that people are committed, really bought into what the organisation is trying to do I think. It's not always plain sailing and there are, you know clearly there's things we can learn. Our people serve our talk a lot about, you know, asking people to take part and listening to what's in there about how we can do better. And so obviously there are things about for example how we manage continuous improvement, how people are able to bring ideas to life and those sorts of things that I'd like us to maybe be better at but even that is indicative of the fact there is a strong desire to help, to do well, to be a truly excellent service and that all makes me feel really proud to be part of this organisation. I think it's an organisation that, you know, is about the people that make it tick."

These changes were largely welcomed but there were also some concerns and feedback around the scope of the changes and eligibility for the increased capital payment rates. Defra and RPA listened to these concerns, acted upon them and issued a further capital payment rates announcement in mid-January with the amended scope. I\u2019m pleased to say I\u2019m now joined by Faye Slade from the RPA\u2019s Countryside Stewardship Agricultural Transition team, to help us navigate the recent updates and give us the latest information. Faye, thank you for joining us today."

            "text": "Faye: As you mentioned, we announced at the Oxford Farming Conference that, from January 2023, we had updated payment rates for both revenue and capital options in Countryside Stewardship. That announcement included that the majority of CS capital payments \u2013 so that\u2019s one-off payments for things like hedgerow creation \u2013 were being increased from 5th January, with rates going up by an average of 48%. We then issued an update to the announcement and that update focused on Countryside Stewardship Capital payment rates for 2023. We listened to feedback from farmers and land managers and, on 18th January, we announced that we had amended the scope of the updated payment rates to allow more farmers to benefit from those higher rates."

This widens the number of customers eligible to receive the higher payment rates by nearly five thousand."

            "text": "James: And I\u2019ve seen some farmers and land managers ask if they can withdraw agreements or items within their agreements, so they can reapply and get the higher capital rates. So, is that an option?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Faye: It might be an option, but there are some factors to consider here and we need to be really clear on this point: if your CS or SFI pilot agreement began in 2022 or earlier, you do have the option to withdraw capital works from your agreement or to withdraw whole agreements and reapply for them, but only if the works haven\u2019t been started. You can only withdraw Capital options where materials have not already been ordered that are needed to do those works and the Capital works have not been started. The other thing to consider is that if you wish to reapply for these items, then you will be required to source any relevant new endorsements or consents."

            "text": "James: Thanks Faye, it\u2019s really helpful to clarify those options. So going back a step to the initial announcement at the beginning of January, there were a few other interesting updates which our listeners may not have picked up."
        },
        {
            "text": "Faye: There certainly were James and, as well as payment rate increases, we really wanted to provide additional flexibility to farmers and land managers. We know how important Countryside Stewardship Capital Grants are to farmers in helping them protect our landscape, and that\u2019s why for 2023 we\u2019ve introduced further improvements building on the rolling application window which we introduced last year."
        },

            "text": "James: We won\u2019t be able to cover all the updates today, but can you just give us a flavour of the improvements this year?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Faye: Well, one example is that farmers told us they feel they need more time to complete capital works. To support this, the duration of agreements has increased for those that start on or after 5 January this year. Agreement Holders will now have three years to complete the capital works in their agreement, so there\u2019s less pressure to complete the actions straight away. We\u2019re also now applying more proportionate reductions if a capital claim is received late. So now, instead of a complete 100% reduction for being just one day late, the reduction will be scaled according to how late the claim is, and hopefully that makes the process a bit fairer."
        },
        {
            "text": "James: They sound really positive developments, all based on insight and feedback, and I believe there are also some significant additions and further payment uplifts this year?"

        {
            "text": "Faye: Yes, we\u2019ve opened a new Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier Capital Grants scheme which offers a selection of specialist Higher Tier capital items, and in the existing Capital Grants scheme we\u2019ve also increased the maximum amount that\u2019s allowable for a single application to \u00a380,000, that\u2019s a limit of \u00a320,000 for four groups. Those groups of options are, Boundaries, Trees and Orchards; Water Quality; Air Quality; and Natural Flood Management. So, this is the latest set of improvements we\u2019ve made to Countryside Stewardship in recent years, and we want to continue to encourage farmers to consider CS as a means to deliver great environmental outcomes."

            "text": "Faye: Yes, CS Higher Tier agreements are usually 5 and sometimes 10 or even 20-year agreements. These agreements help manage environmentally significant sites, commons, woodlands \u2013 and the works involved range from planting and maintaining new hedgerows or woodland, right through to restoring peatland and moorland."

            "text": "Faye: Well, first of all it\u2019s important to highlight that applications are welcome from all farmers and land managers, not just those who\u2019ve already been approached by Natural England advisers.\u00a0 We particularly welcome applications from those who want to protect, restore, enhance or create habitats, such as flower rich hay meadows, heathland, moorland, woodland and wood pasture, as well as those who wish to maintain other aspects of their land. If farmers and land managers are interested in applying for CS Higher Tier, they should apply via an application pack using the Rural Payments portal, and advice is also available from Natural England or the Forestry Commission."

While CS Higher Tier will continue to use the established application process, CS Mid Tier is going to look a little different this year. So, to make sure we\u2019ve got everything in place we\u2019re moving the CS Mid Tier window this year to slightly later in the spring. The window will remain open for the same length of time so anyone that wants to apply should still have plenty of time to do so. We\u2019re really excited about the changes and believe that this is going to make things even more straightforward for farmers to apply."

Now the whole picture has been set out, you can really see that there\u2019s something for everyone in our schemes and grants.

Last year, we opened the SFI with 3 standards, with paid actions to do with improving soil health and moorlands, and there are now over 2,100 live SFI agreements. We\u2019re going to learn as we go, expanding and refining the offer until the full scheme is available in 2024. Working in this way means we can make sure we\u2019re giving farmers the support they need to produce high-quality food and take care of the environment. And, importantly, we\u2019re making sure that there\u2019s an offer for all farm types, regardless of size, location, ownership or the systems used."

In fact, we\u2019re introducing six new standards this summer \u2013 that\u2019s three more standards than planned. It gives farmers a wide-ranging offer and helps us to achieve our ambitions for food production, the environment and climate. The six new standards are about nutrient management, integrated pest management, hedgerows, arable and horticultural land, improved grassland, and low input grassland standard."

If you carry out the actions, payments will go to you. Also, you can leave the scheme early, with no penalty, if you unexpectedly lose management control of the land you\u2019ve entered into the scheme."

It responds to feedback about the management and administrative costs of being in the scheme and makes it viable and attractive. The payment is \u00a320 per hectare, for up to the first 50 hectares of land entered into SFI actions. This means farmers will receive up to \u00a31,000 per year in addition to their agreement to cover the administrative costs of participation. We\u2019ll keep this payment under review over the next two years, along with all other elements of scheme design and delivery, to make sure the scheme works for farmers, delivers value for money and achieves our ambitions."

We need that to change if we\u2019re to achieve our challenging environmental targets."

Building on the success of Countryside Stewardship, we\u2019ve decided to evolve Countryside Stewardship to include what we\u2019d originally planned for Local Nature Recovery, rather than introducing a new Local Nature Recovery scheme. This will enable us to achieve our original ambitions through a faster, smoother and familiar route. We\u2019re going to improve CS so farmers benefit from greater flexibility over when they can apply and how they manage their agreements, with improved access for tenant farmers and increased access to Higher Tier options and agreements.\u202fThe evolution of the Countryside Stewardship scheme will see around 30 additional actions available to farmers by the end of 2024 and, as the schemes evolve over the next two years, we intend to offer SFI and CS in a single, integrated service. There\u2019s also Countryside Stewardship Plus, which will encourage collaboration between land managers, helping them work together to improve their local environment."

Where there are similar actions in both SFI and CS we\u2019ll maintain parity of payment rates across both schemes. So, if you're already carrying out actions in CS you\u2019re not at a disadvantage. People with a CS agreement can also have an SFI agreement, so long as we\u2019re not paying for the same actions twice on the same piece of land, and the actions which we\u2019re paying for are compatible. The scheme will also include what\u2019s currently available through the England Woodland Creation Offer, once that scheme has transitioned. We\u2019ll also improve access for tenants and expand access to Higher Tier options and agreements."

As you said, we\u2019ll open applications for further rounds of Landscape Recovery in spring this year and in 2024, and the second round will focus on net zero, protected sites and habitat creation."

Farmers could consider carbon audits and benchmarking tools as well. So, there\u2019s really a wide range of providers and support available and you are welcome to get introductory help and information from multiple providers.
