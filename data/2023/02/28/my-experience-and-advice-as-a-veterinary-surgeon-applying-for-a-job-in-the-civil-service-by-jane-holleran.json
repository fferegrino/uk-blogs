In contrast, initially I found applying for a position in the Civil Service to be very daunting. Being more generalist, the process requires evidence of skills and behaviours under the \u2018Success Profiles\u2019 framework, something I was unfamiliar with when first applying for positions."

I hope providing an insight into my experience with the Civil Service application process, I can help any vets considering making the transition."

Civil Service recruitment is focused on understanding decisions made and actions performed to demonstrate a behaviour or skill. It\u2019s easy to be overly descriptive, but using the CAR and STAR formats help avoids this and keeps things concise. Even something you may consider menial, such as completing insurance forms and prescriptions, can be used to demonstrate organisation, attention to detail and the ability to prioritise."

I explained that this is fundamental to veterinary work, giving examples on how I obtained evidence, such as blood tests and use of data (which was sometimes limited) to make clinical decisions."

Behaviours, on the GOV.UK \u00a0website, are stated as \u2018actions and activities that people do which result in effective performance in a job\u2019. I was interviewed on four behaviours, one of which was \u2018Changing and Improving\u2019."

This got me thinking about potential questions relating to this theme, for example \u2018Describe a time when you changed the way you work?\u2019 Using a real-life example and STAR method, I recalled how I had adjusted my surgical technique for performing bitch spays, which resulted in shorter surgical time and reduced intra-operative bleeding, giving me much more confidence to perform this procedure unassisted."
