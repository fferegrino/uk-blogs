It\u2019s an excellent way to suit the learning style of someone who enjoys study, but also learns by gaining first-hand experience. Furthermore, I have developed as an individual, as the rotational aspect of an apprenticeship exposes you to so many people at different levels of their career, with different knowledge and specialties."
