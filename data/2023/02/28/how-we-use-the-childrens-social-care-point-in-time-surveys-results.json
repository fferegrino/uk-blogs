For example, if several responses about a service mention high staff turnover, we might bring its inspection forward. This is because high staff turnover can indicate a lack of stability for children."

            "text": "If a service receives very few responses or blank surveys, we may well prioritise that service\u2019s inspection.

            "text": "Inspectors will review responses while they prepare an inspection. This can help them decide what their lines of enquiry will be, what they need more information about, and what concerns they want to look in to. The survey responses help them identify potential risks and problems or things that could develop into bigger issues if left unchecked."

            "text": "It\u2019s not just negatives. The responses can also help inspectors look for positives and good practice.

Last year, we received over 40,000 responses including nearly 6,000 from children. The responses helped us raise concerns about issues including children\u2019s mental health in secure homes. But we were also able to highlight good news like the fact that most children said their relationships with the adults and children where they lived or stayed were positive."
