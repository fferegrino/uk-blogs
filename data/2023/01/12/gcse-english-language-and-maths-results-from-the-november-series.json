GCSE English language and maths are available every November. Entry is restricted to students aged 16 and over. Most entries are from students seeking to improve their grade from the previous summer, or from students that had planned to enter in the summer but were unable to do so."

This includes a breakdown of results for each subject. Most students entering in November are re-sitting their exams, so the cohort of students is different to the summer. It is therefore not meaningful to make comparisons between the results in November and the summer."

        {
            "text": "It is also not possible to make meaningful comparisons between results this year and in previous November series, or between exam boards. The different assessment arrangements that have been in place over the past few years due to the pandemic mean that entries have fluctuated, and the cohorts of students are likely to be different. For example, final entries this November are around 5% lower than in November 2021."

As outlined above, the approach to grading this November was for exam boards to seek alignment with the standard in summer 2022. This is different to summer 2023 when the aim of grading will be to return to pre-pandemic standards, while providing students with some protection against any impact of COVID-19 disruption."
