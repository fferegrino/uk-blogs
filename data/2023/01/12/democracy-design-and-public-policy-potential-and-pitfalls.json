It is a part of a family of approaches that shares an interest in attending to lived experience, participation, using evidence to shape decisions, and methods such as visualisation."

But less well understood are \u2018designs for participation\u2019. Here design is often focused on improving civic participation as an end in itself, for example through experimental approaches to participation or improving or changing designed aspects of democratic processes (eg voter registration, voting)."

The workshop will begin with provocations from three invited speakers. Design researcher Joyce Yee is Professor of Design and Social Innovation at Northumbria University, co-author of Transformations by Design and currently working on a social innovation project across Asia. Political theorist Michael Saward is Professor of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick and author of the recent book Democratic Design (2022) (see book launch here). Catherine Greig is founder of architecture and design studio MakeGood, which works with people in local communities to shape change. Following three short provocations from our speakers, we will host a discussion and an activity in breakout groups."

For example, members of the community were invited to carry out voluntary peer review of learning materials for the new Policy to Delivery Course developed by the Policy Design Community for government."
