We would like to share how Waltham Forest Safe and Together partnership tackles domestic abuse by adopting the Safe and together model. The partnership has evolved in line with the ethos of Supporting Families programme. Families need to feel confident when accessing services and Lead Practitioner training is key to adopting a whole family approach."

            "text": "\u2018Safe and Together\u2019 is an internationally recognised model which was first developed in the United States (USA). The model encourages cultural and systematic shifts in practice, including changing the language around working with survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse. Lead practitioners are provided with a suite of tools and interventions to identify and highlight survivor strengths and recognising domestic abuse as a parenting choice of the perpetrator. As such, the model equips practitioners in engaging with risk and taking a strengths-based approach in engaging whole families where their domestic abuse is a factor, including holding the perpetrator accountable for the impact of the abuse on family functioning."

This fits with the revised Domestic Abuse Act 2021, under which children in the UK are recognised as victims of domestic abuse, rather than witnesses."

The model challenges the double standards in relation to parenting and gender, holding fathers to the same high expectations we hold mothers to."

        {
            "text": "By identifying, mapping, and addressing perpetrator patterns of behaviour, we can shift from this narrative and have an overall understanding of survivors\u2019 responses to abusive behaviours. The feedback has been resoundingly positive. The model is transformative in the outcomes we see for families achieved through the skills and competencies utilised and increasing the confidence of lead practitioners in engaging perpetrators of abuse. The transformation starts at the beginning of the work, not at the end. It highlights an emphasis on early intervention and support for families."

This is attributed directly to the implementation of the model and the increased practitioner skills in discussing the domestic abuse with the family."
