            "text": "Policy Lab has an eight year history of testing innovative approaches to policymaking. Central to this story is collaboration between different disciplines, whether they be from the social sciences, sciences, humanities or arts. Some of the methods, such as design and film ethnography, have been increasingly integrated into mainstream policymaking whilst others, such as Collective Intelligence, are still emergent.\u00a0"

We are pleased to announce the launch of a pilot initiative to test one of these methods. MANIFEST is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to evaluate artistic approaches and effects relevant for policy, and how artists can work with policymakers to channel those dimensions to improve the process of policymaking."

            "text": "The work builds on previous interdisciplinary projects run from Policy Lab. For example in 2019 we created and displayed speculative autonomous marine flags on board RFA Lyme Bay. Around the same time we used physical artefacts to help citizens and policymakers develop better street design whilst in 2018 we borrowed from participatory art to help map interdependencies between critical national infrastructure and satellite services.\u00a0"

            "text": "Our approach has been informed by the Artist Placement Group (APG), an interesting British innovation from the 1960s and 1970s. The APG was formed in 1966 by artists including Barbara Steveni and John Latham, initially working in the UK\u2019s public and private industries such as National Coal Board and ICI Fibres Ltd. In 1972 Steveni negotiated the Whitehall Civil Service Memorandum with the UK government to expand the role of the APG to government organisations including the Department of Health and Social Security and the Scottish Office."

            "text": "We are working with three artists in the first iteration of MANIFEST. Christopher Samuel is a multi-disciplinary artist whose practice is rooted in identity and disability politics, often echoing the many facets of his own lived experience. Seeking to interrogate his personal understanding of identity as a disabled person impacted by inequality and marginalisation, Christopher responds with urgency, humour, and poetic subversiveness within his work. This approach aims to make his work accessible to a wider audience, allowing others to identify and relate to a wider spectrum of human experience."

Over twenty years they have become known for an innovative body of work, which explores the material nature of our world and how we experience it through the lenses of science and technology. They occupy a unique position in the art world, blending, in philosophically compelling ways, experimental moving image techniques, scientific research and digital technologies."

His work uses still and moving image, sound and installation, in galleries and public spaces, centring on people\u2019s personal, social and working lives. Contexts include transport networks, hospitals, airports and prisons - seeking to capture people\u2019s physical appearances and reflect upon aspects that remain out-of-sight - revealing desires, philosophies, vulnerabilities, experiences and motivations."

            "text": "A range of other partners have been critical to getting MANIFEST off the ground. King\u2019s College London has provided curatorial and programmatic support to bring a connection to academic research. CVAN England, as a national network for contemporary arts, has supported the development and approach to commissioning and used its network and knowledge to access artists across the country. The University of the Arts London are working on the evaluation of the pilot programme. Finally, the Civil Service Policy Profession Unit has supported the programme within government and provides access to resources and networks across the wider profession of 32,000 policymakers in government."

I am confident that the pilot will help us better understand how creativity can improve the way decisions are made and demonstrate the power of artistic approaches\u201d."
