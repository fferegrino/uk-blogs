Let\u2019s call these Business Stream BAs and Technical Stream BAs."

You probably spend more time than your colleagues working out how you can improve the day to day, create tools to help everyone do their jobs in things like spreadsheets, ask \u201cwhy\u201d more often than everyone is comfy with, and you are trying to understand the context in which you work so that you can de-clutter it and do the fun bits of your job better. You may have found yourself becoming a subject matter expert in the systems and processes around you and are finding yourself drawn towards business change programmes where you can make things better."

You will have searched out users to have a chat, tried to understand the business context of what you are doing and probably made suggestions to make your product more useful. You will have looked over the top of your silo and seen that there might be different or better ways of doing things, and you will find yourself interested in projects where you can make a difference and impact more of the links in the software development or Agile lifecycle."

Many departments are adopting a grow-your-own strategy to technical skills so look at what is going on in your own DDaT business analysis function \u2013 for instance at the ONS we have started a programme for entry level business analysts to learn on the job. Also, it is worth volunteering within your own organisation to get more involved in change projects and build both your skill set and exposure."
