We always knew that launching a new service would be tough; a DevSecOps service is not novel, not for industry nor for other parts of Defence, but as an enterprise-wide solution, it is unique for Defence. We\u2019ve faced many obstacles and we\u2019ve learned a lot which we can take forward as we develop the service.\u00a0"

Currently delivered as an MVP for the Developer and Team Leader journeys, it will allow the user to navigate their way through the onboarding process without manual intervention. Users will find all the information they need on the service and it will allow users to sign-up, view learning and access the D2S platform all in one place. This new addition will provide significant value to our users by reducing onboarding times from 10 days to just 48 hours."

If you are interested in taking part, please contact the team."
