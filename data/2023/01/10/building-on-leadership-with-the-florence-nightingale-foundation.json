I had never heard of the Foundation before, but after a discussion with a friend about helping people understand the impact of coronavirus restrictions on care homes during the pandemic, she recommended the scholarship as a way to get my voice heard."

I presented my QIP to the FNF panel with a lot of enthusiasm! I was keen to highlight the levels of loneliness and social isolation people living in care homes had been experiencing during periods of lockdown, and the ways I felt certain changes could make a difference."

At this point, I had not anticipated what amazing opportunities would be coming my way. We started with a welcome day, where I met some incredible fellow nurses, all with varied experiences and knowledge and all with inspiring ideas on how they would improve practice in their fields of work."

These have not been your standard \u2018sit back and take notes on theory\u2019 courses.
