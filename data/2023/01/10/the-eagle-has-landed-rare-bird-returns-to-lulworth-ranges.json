The project is re-establishing a population of white-tailed eagles in parts of southern England which remain highly suitable for the species \u2013 including MOD sites such as Lulworth Ranges, where we were delighted to recently learn that two of the released birds have been spending a considerable amount of time."

Six eagles were initially released in 2019, with the aim to release up to 60 birds over a five-year period and establish several breeding pairs along the south coast."

Some have even crossed the English Channel to spend time in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. However far they explore, the tracking data clearly shows that the birds consistently return to their natal home in the south coast of England."

            "text": "Excitingly, the satellite data has shown that two of the birds released in 2021, known as G801 and G816, have been favouring the habitats of the Lulworth Ranges in Dorset. It\u2019s highly likely that these and other released birds will have been spending time at other nearby MOD sites too."

The unique history of our military training areas means they still support large areas of wildlife-rich habitat, which haven\u2019t been affected by intensive agricultural practices or urbanisation to the same extent as the wider countryside."

Part of the site was established as the very first British tank firing range in 1917, and the ranges now cover 2,830 hectares, over 75% of which is designated as part of three separate Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)."

The site supports large areas of open heathland, chalk grassland on very steep slopes, pockets of ancient woodland, high sea cliffs and many other habitats. Marsh clubmoss, nightjar, sand lizard, smooth snake, Lulworth skipper butterfly, southern damselfly, dormice, greater horseshoe bats and peregrine falcon are just a few of the rare species associated with these habitats across the ranges."

Discussions are underway to find out more about why the eagles are attracted to the site, but clearly regular tank firing is not putting them off!"

There are also several circular walks within the ranges, but please be sure to check firing times in advance and stick to permitted routes when accessing MOD land."
