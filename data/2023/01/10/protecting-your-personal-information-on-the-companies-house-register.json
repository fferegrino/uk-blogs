However, we know that publishing this personal information in the public domain can lead to the risk of fraud, identity theft or other harm.\u00a0One of the aims of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill is to balance the need for corporate transparency with the understanding that personal information should only be published when it\u2019s necessary and proportionate to do so.\u00a0We want to make sure the register does not become a tool for abuse of personal information.\u00a0"
