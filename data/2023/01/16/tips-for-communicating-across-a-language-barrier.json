So much of the job relies on being able to interpret behaviour, social context and intonation. That\u2019s why we like working closely with participants, where we can communicate freely.\u00a0"

            "text": "However, there are times in every user researcher's career where seamless communication isn't so straightforward. One example of this scenario is when the researcher and participant speak different languages. As daunting as it can feel, there is no need to worry, and all is not lost. You can still get highly robust and meaningful insights from the research. In fact, I\u2019ve found that\u00a0 when I can\u2019t rely on understanding what the participants have said to me, I\u2019ve been able to draw\u00a0 more actively on my other research skills. This is my story of how I approached that very scenario.\u00a0"

In March 2022, I was working on a project in partnership with the Thai government. For this Thai agency, user centred design and user research were new practices for governmental work. They were interested in seeing how other international governments use user research to inform their work and improve designs by directly involving users.\u00a0"

By setting up each research session so that the team clearly knew their roles, ie. who was greeting the participants at the venue, facilitating the session, note-taking, translating, observing, and even taking a break, meant that everybody knew what to expect and the research was stronger for it. This made the juggling act much easier."

They often don\u2019t know what to expect, wonder if they are doing it \u2018right\u2019, or might feel \u2018watched\u2019. User researchers work hard to inform participants every step of the way, create trust and help the participant feel safe and comfortable throughout.\u00a0"
