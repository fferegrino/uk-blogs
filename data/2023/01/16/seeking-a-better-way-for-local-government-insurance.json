This is because the public sector has a wide and diverse asset portfolio; a reliable income through its ability to raise revenue through taxation; and access to borrowed funds more cheaply than any in the private sector. In addition, commercial providers of insurance also have to meet their own costs and profit margins."

That\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t set up with its own financial support, such as seed capital or a parental guarantee. So, it wouldn\u2019t be capable of paying out for excessive claims in the short-term. To get around this, LGM appointed a panel of insurers to help cover the risk."

        {
            "text": "The logic was that LGM\u2019s finances would strengthen over time as more councils joined. This would enable LGM to retain a larger share of the risk, and to scale back the use of commercial insurance. So, LGM\u2019s ultimate success would reduce local government\u2019s need for buying commercial insurance. This would suggest that LGM was a threat to the insurance market, and so might not get the wholehearted support of insurers."
        },
        {
            "text": "And so it played out. As LGM prepared to onboard its first tranche of local authorities, support from the insurance panel evaporated. The supply (of insurance through LGM) was no longer there to meet the demand. This meant that LGM no longer had a viable proposition and had to go back to the drawing board."
        },
        {
            "text": "LGM still needed insurance, so sought out willing insurers to collaborate. At one stage we had an insurer ready to accept the risk of one of the larger unitary authorities. This enabled LGM to offer a substantial reduction on the previous year\u2019s premium. However, the local authority\u2019s incumbent insurer responded with a further reduction, and the authority was obliged to take the cheapest option. So, this time it was the demand (for insurance through LGM) that fell away."

The pandemic also changed the nature of the risks faced by local authorities and their dealings with insurers. In 2020, GAD published a report on the impact of COVID-19 on the public sector\u2019s insurance risks."
        },
        {
            "text": "Even as the UK began to recover from the pandemic, the setbacks for the mutual continued. Local authorities preferred safety in numbers, wanting to join the mutual as part of a set rather than be the first. Insurance partners also wanted multiple authorities to sign up, to diversify the risk profile. But many local authorities were tied into multi-year insurance contracts. Along with different renewal dates, this made it trickier to line up that critical mass."
