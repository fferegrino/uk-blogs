Salisbury Plain Training Area in Wiltshire has produced a palaeolithic bifaced axe, an Early Iron Age to Late Bronze Age midden with feasting debris up to 3m deep, a collection of Roman villages in the artillery impact area and is the site of a Battle of Britain Spitfire crash. Otterburn Training Area in Northumberland is home to a shrine to the Romano-British God Cocidius, which is carved into a rock high above a vale. A WW1 Anti-Aircraft Battery at DM Crombie, West Fife is one of only a handful of similar sites across the UK and the St Kilda historic landscape in the Outer Hebrides dates from prehistory to the 1930s, with mixed natural and cultural World Heritage Site designations."

Gosport Oil Fuel Depot, Hampshire dates to 1907 and is an early example of the storage of fuel oil, and the Atomic Weapons Research establishment storage area at MOD Shoeburyness, Essex bears the marks of hands that built the first British nuclear weapon, leaving their patina on surviving door handles, presses, tools and instruments. The smallest monument is a War Department boundary marker, also in Gosport which got lost in long grass!"
