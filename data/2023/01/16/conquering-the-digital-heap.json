This failure was not unique to the UK or to the government, but a consequence of how disruptive technology has often outpaced established administrative or legal requirements."

Many departments have since taken steps to bring their \u2018heap\u2019 under control.\u00a0"

Cabinet Office have successfully maintained high standards since, even through the disruption of the Covid pandemic."
