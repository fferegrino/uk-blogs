This study will be vital to shaping our strategy to get our veterans into work after their time serving this country.\u2018It shows the willingness of employers across the country to take full advantage of the opportunity that these skilled individuals can provide.\u2019The report also makes a number of recommendations, including stepping up working with employers to provide them with more information and guidance, particularly focusing on the diverse range of skills and benefits ex-Service personnel can bring to employers. The report also says misconceptions around mental health in the veteran community should be tackled, with more communications around the challenges veterans do and do not face."
