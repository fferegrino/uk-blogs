            "text": "Working at Vida has shown me how important it is for all nurses to have the opportunity to take a placement or work in a specialist dementia care setting and to interact with people living with dementia. The more experience you have, the more you understand why people living with the disease act in certain ways. This gives you the knowledge and confidence to provide appropriate care."

At Vida, we receive a significant amount of training on how to de-escalate situations and support residents to avoid becoming distressed. Building a relationship with a resident also helps, as it enables you to understand and avoid any triggers which might cause them stress."

We build relationships with our residents and care for the whole person \u2013 they\u2019re not a statistic or someone who is unknown. We learn their daily routine, we know their likes and dislikes, and we know how to keep them happy. It\u2019s really rewarding when we have the opportunity to spend time with them. Even simply sitting down and enjoying a companionable cup of tea can be a highlight of our day."
