Through visiting different areas of the UK we speak with workers on or close to the minimum and living wage as well as the employers who are directly affected by the change in rates."

            "text": "The real-life experiences of those in low-paid work and of those employers in low-paying sectors are hard to understand from the statistics alone. By talking face to face with the people most affected by our recommendations, Commissioners can understand what is happening on the ground and the themes and issues which are emerging."
        },
        {
            "text": "On our visits last year, we heard valuable evidence from workers on the cost of living, insecure employment and work intensification. Employers told us they had responded to the NLW increases by increasing prices, reducing profits and pay differentials and smaller firms reduced investment. These insights enable the LPC to better understand the impact of our work on both workers and employers. Last year in Leicester, we concentrated specifically on compliance issues, speaking with workers, employers and interested parties in the garment industry. The evidence we heard formed our report on Compliance and enforcement of the National Minimum Wage: the case of the Leicester textiles sector."
