One way we plan to do this is by ensuring more potential apprentices and employers are aware of the opportunities apprenticeships bring. A great way to do that is by them hearing from their peers \u2013 people who have been in their shoes \u2013 and our Apprenticeships Ambassadors Network (AAN) of over 1,000 volunteer employers and apprentices do this to inspire through telling their own stories. Our challenge was how could we maximise the impact of these expert ambassadors."

An ambassador will be engaged with the 3,500 secondary schools and colleges in England to inspire the next generation of apprentices, and ambassadors will buddy with new small business employers to ensure they get expert advice during the early days of their journey into the world of apprenticeships."

This is happening across government as well as across other areas of our lives to provide a better user experience. The benefits of digital are that it can be scaled and drive better value for the taxpayer.\u201d"

This will help us create a virtuous circle where we can educate and inspire others and then grow as these individuals join us as future ambassadors. We realise that simply introducing digital systems alone won\u2019t achieve our goals. So, we are now also considering what other changes are needed to ensure these benefits are realised. This might be the skills to use the portal, or changes to how we use the more personal onboarding elements."
