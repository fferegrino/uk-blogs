            "text": "Good ventilation reduces infection risks and can improve the health and well-being of people living, visiting or working in care homes. Poorly ventilated buildings can suffer from damp and mould, which is hard and expensive to tackle, as well as being associated with an increase in the chances of respiratory infections."

        },
        {
            "text": "Naturally ventilated buildings use windows, doors and vents to allow air to flow in and out of spaces. The amount of ventilation depends on the weather, with windy days more likely to create ventilation than still days. Mechanical ventilation uses fans to move air into and out of rooms."

        {
            "text": "Many care homes use local air conditioning units. You may not know that most devices simply cool and recirculate air within a space, but they don\u2019t provide any fresh air. This means that a room can feel more \u201ccomfortable\u201d but not be better ventilated, and so infection risks remain."
        },
        {
            "text": "It is much easier to ensure good ventilation if you avoid cold and draughts. Some small things can make a big difference \u2013 for example opening high level windows, avoiding blocking radiators and making sure heating and ventilation systems are working properly can all help."

            "text": "Airborne infection risk is greatest in shared spaces where people gather for longer periods of time, such as in communal lounges or dining rooms. Short periods of time in a poorly ventilated space are unlikely to pose a significant risk but spending hours in a poorly ventilated room with a lot of people means particles build up in the air and are more likely to be breathed in by more people with an increasing risk."

            "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) meters are simple, relatively low-cost devices, able to help staff judge the effectiveness of ventilation efforts. The amount of CO2 in the air in an occupied room reflects the amount of fresh air \u2013 the lower the CO2 the better the ventilation. CO2 meters are not foolproof, as false or inaccurate readings can happen. However, the best monitors are those using non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) sensors. They should be regularly checked and, if necessary, calibrated according to manufacturer guidance."
