To inspire you, we spoke to colleagues in the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team at the Department for International Trade (DIT). We asked them about their career journey into their current roles, what inspired them to join us and their advice for someone wanting to make a similar move.\u00a0\u00a0"

Prior to joining the Civil Service, I was a teacher for 13 years. I led Business and Computer Science at a school in Devon and enjoyed leading Enterprise Days. These involved bringing together local and national businesses to inspire students to think about careers and apprenticeships. In fact, that is where I started my passion for promoting apprenticeships and I have been involved in National Apprenticeship Week since it began back in 2007."

It is flexible, interesting and there is the opportunity to work part-time in almost any role, so you don\u2019t have to choose between career progression and bringing up a young family. The DDaT profession was a perfect next step with my experience working on an IT Helpdesk and teaching IT and Computer Science in schools. I am lucky to be able to work in the DDaT Profession and support all teams with their talent, wellbeing, and capability. I also represent DIT DDaT across government on areas such as apprenticeships and the DDaT Capability Framework."

Over 6 weeks I saw that while we could get talented copywriters easily, good data scientists were much harder to find. Having even one data scientist could transform your campaign. For every \u00a35 we raised, \u00a31 was down to them."

It won\u2019t be long before you\u2019ve got enough to back yourself on an entry-level job application. For me, the basics meant learning in my own time on Udemy while being on the furlough scheme in 2020. By the end of the year, I\u2019d started a data analysis apprenticeship at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Then, I applied for my first data science role at DIT at the end of 2021. Achieving all this in 2 years isn\u2019t bad!"

They endlessly turn up questions in their data, and the answers to these bring even more questions. When you care about what you are trying to do, hours can melt away as you investigate data, learn problem-solving techniques and troubleshoot your implementation. You do it again and again as you begin to untangle exactly what secrets lurk down in the depths of the data. Great fun!"
