At the end of every training season, the Prairie Infrastructure Team (PIT) is tasked with the \u2018winterisation\u2019 of the training area. This is a challenging but vital task that involves closing down the training villages and preparing them for the extreme weather conditions that the Canadian winter can bring."

The extreme cold alone can have a destructive impact on training infrastructure, so it\u2019s vital that repairs are carried out ahead of the winter season, as well as providing buildings and assets in the training villages with sufficient protection to prevent them from being damaged by the elements."

All winterisation work needs to be completed by the end of September, before the extreme winter conditions set in. The work is wide-ranging and can call for extensive repairs, as you might expect following months of training exercises!"

There have been occasions in the past where doors on shipping containers used for training have been left open and as the wind passes through, it has flipped the containers onto their sides, as well as destroying some smaller buildings. Preventing potentially dangerous incidents such as these through careful maintenance work is a key part of our year-round mission to provide a \u2018Safe Place to Train\u2019 at BATUS."

One of the team\u2019s main efforts year-round, and especially prior to the winter months, is to make sure that the buildings on the MTA are as inaccessible as possible, as wildlife can enter through the smallest of gaps. It\u2019s important to prevent any SAR from nesting in one of the buildings as unfortunately this can severely restrict training within the area, or even force exercising units to re-plan and re-locate to another area of the MTA."

Though much of this work happens behind-the-scenes, it\u2019s instrumental in providing a training environment that\u2019s both realistic and safe for training personnel, as well as maintaining the consent to train that the British Army has held in Canada since 1972."
