We continue to make every effort to achieve this, including building our capacity through recruitment, developing digital application processes to make land registration quicker and easier, and making strides to increase our underlying productivity. We are seeing the results of this: HM Land Registry\u2019s output has increased for the past two years and at the end of 2022 our productivity was higher than any time in the previous three years."

In general, requisitions stop just over 1 in 5 applications being processed first time. Including complex issues, we send around 1 million requisitions a year and, in 2022, over half of these (579,000) involved one or more issues that could have been avoided \u2013 more than 845,000 points between them."

We know how frustrating this can be for applicants."

            "text": "When our caseworker spots an error or omission in the application, they must contact the applicant who submitted the application to correct it or seek the missing information. This delays the application for an average of two weeks in the simplest cases and more than six weeks for complex applications. Sometimes it can be significantly longer, particularly if we need to go back and forth a few times over several months until we have received all the information we need from the applicant to complete the application."

Basic errors or omissions in applications like these create a bottleneck in the system and a drain on time and resources."

Firms doing very similar work can have vastly different requisition rates. That must make post-completion work easier for those who ensure the application is high quality. Their investment also pays dividends in the speed and efficiency of land registration generally. I would like to thank them for their efforts."
