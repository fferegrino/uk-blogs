Part of DIT's work involves providing advice and assistance to make global trading easier. At the end of the transition period, the Export Support Service (ESS) was established to provide guidance to companies seeking to export to Europe in the new trading environment. Plans are underway to develop this service into other markets. It will act as front door for traders to access the wider DIT offering for exporters. The ESS has since been identified as one of the top 75 priority services in the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO)\u2019s 2025 roadmap for digital and data.\u00a0"

It starts by taking their details and the identifying issues they are facing. It then connects businesses to an advisor who provides them with tailored advice and guidance. The service helps exporters with a range of issues such as exporting to new markets, understanding paperwork needed to sell goods abroad, or rules for selling services to a specific country.\u00a0"

One of our first challenges when developing the master dataset was to ensure that all teams agreed when it comes to what data will be collected, processed and assessed. This data includes the query itself, as well as data on the enquirer and their company, company size and what sector they operate in. Much of this data is used for analysis and reporting purposes. We also needed changes in data collection to be mutually agreed, so that removing questions in the enquiry form didn\u2019t affect our ability to assess the service.\u00a0"

The advantage of this was the development of an extensive dataset, containing cleaned and processed data for easier analysis, reporting and evaluation. It also provides a dataset from which data can be easily extracted and shared. The benefits of this are that we have clear and accessible information on the nature of enquiries. This allows us to better understand what companies and individuals are enquiring about, what they need, and the characteristics of companies enquiring. Consequently, we are more able to improve and refine our service to better serve the needs of our customers.\u00a0"
