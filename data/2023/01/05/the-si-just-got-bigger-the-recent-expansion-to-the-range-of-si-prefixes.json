            "text": "The International System of Units (SI) is the only system of measurement units accepted worldwide. Its study, curation and development are at the heart of National Metrology Institutes\u2019 mission. Within the SI there are three pillars: the SI base units, the SI derived units and SI prefixes. Not only do prefixes permeate our everyday weights and measures \u2013 the kilogram, centimetre and millilitre \u2013 but they are also adopted in non-technical terms that we all use such as nanotechnology, micro-scooter and Gigafactory."

            "text": "The SI prefixes are a key part of what distinguishes a decimal-based measurement system from non-decimal systems. When measurements become very big or very small, the SI continues to use the same units and just adds decimal prefixes: 1 kilometre = 1,000 metres = 1,000,000 millimetres. On the other hand, non-decimal systems invent new names for units to address changes in measurement size: 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet = 63,360 inches."

            "text": "Our system of SI prefixes has expanded over the years in response to advances in science and technology requiring access to an increased range of orders of magnitude relating to measurement. The last such expansion, and the only one in my lifetime to date, was 31 years ago in October 1991. Little did I know then that I would be heavily involved in the next update to the SI prefixes. The change in 1991 increased the range to cover between 1024 (yotta, Y) and 10-24 (yocto, y), principally to meet the needs of chemistry to express molecular quantities in SI units. Those 31 years that have passed since then represent the longest gap between extensions to the range of prefixes since they were first adopted by the Metre Convention in 1879, four years after the treaty was signed. Back then only the range from 1000 to 1/1000 was covered: kilo to milli."

            "text": "As the global datasphere continues to grow at an increasing rate, rapidly approaching 1 yottabyte, the clamour for what comes next becomes driven by a real application in the near future and speculation becomes closer to reality. I first came across this issue in 2017 whilst listening to a BBC More or Less programme. This contained the revelation that unofficial names for \u20181027 bytes\u2019 were gaining traction and stood a chance of being adopted de facto. These were brontobyte (from \u2018brontosaurus\u2019) and hellabyte (from \u2018hell of a big number\u2019). Not only were these names distressingly unsystematic when compared to the Metre Convention\u2019s traditionally sober approach to naming prefixes, but they would also be confusing because \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018H\u2019 were already in use as symbols for well-known units."

            "text": "The SI had to act. I started the process of proposing new names and symbols for an extension to the SI prefix range and steering this through the relevant metrology committees. An analysis demonstrated that the only letters left largely unused in the English alphabet were \u2018q\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019. Most recently the names for the prefixes had been based \u2013 incredibly loosely \u2013 on the Latin and Greek numbers for the power of 1000 in question; therefore, nine and ten in this case. Throw in the requirement that prefix multiples should end in an \u2018a\u2019 and sub-multiples in an \u2018o\u2019 and my suggestions were:"
