Her favourite personal project, \u2018The 12%\u2019, focused on unravelling the potential for people from working class backgrounds to pursue careers in the cultural and creative industries- a timely issue, with recent research showing a steady decline in the socio-economic diversity of the sector. Chloe addressed the challenge through a range of workshops, tailored to school leavers in her hometown of Doncaster."
