This information can be collected much more quickly than death registrations, so it can be used as an early warning signal of changes in trends to support public health actions. By using this measure, we were able to cut the reporting lag associated with death registrations from 11 days to 2-3 days. The deaths with COVID-19 metric has been used as the leading death indicator on the Gov.uk dashboard until 26 January 2023.\u00a0"
