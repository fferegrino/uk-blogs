By sharing knowledge and research across a range of issues such as pests, diseases and invasive species, the conference has fostered a level of international collaboration that will strengthen global biosecurity standards and international plant health for generations to come."

This exciting scheme will help to upskill and diversify the forestry sector workforce, which in turn will expand the workforce capacity for the long-term, supporting the Government\u2019s tree planting and woodland creation ambitions over the coming years. It\u2019s a great example of the transformational work of the Nature for Climate Tree Programme, alongside getting trees in the ground."

We sadly didn\u2019t get to meet Sean ourselves (much to our children\u2019s disappointment!) but Minister for Environment Trudy Harrison did when she visited the NCF funded Minorca Woods site on November 29th and helped to plant a native oak tree."

Forest Research assessments showed around 12,750 hectares of trees were lost as result of winter storms, with most of the damage being attributed to Storm Arwen in November 2021. Over 90 percent of trees which fall as a result of storm damage will be replanted, meaning only a small percent of forest is lost in the long term where it is not possible to restock."

Trees for Cities will extend their \u201cForgotten Places\u201d programme across five areas that are nature-deprived, planting a total of over 5,000 trees and Earthwatch will plant 1,800 trees to create three \u201cTiny Forests\u201d (a dense, fast-growing native woodland the size of a tennis court) in urban areas with low woodland cover."

Single trees (defined as trees outside of woodlands in urban and rural areas) have been valued at an incredible \u00a33.8 billion. This valuation takes in to account the role trees play in mitigating climate change and damage caused to infrastructure and the public as result of flooding and other extreme weather. Other benefits include temperature regulation as our summers get hotter and drier, as well reducing noise and air pollution in urban areas. It\u2019s an absolute privilege to be helping that number to grow."
