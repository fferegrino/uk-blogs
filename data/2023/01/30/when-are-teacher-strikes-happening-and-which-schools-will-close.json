            "text": "In some schools there may be little or no impact from strike action but in others it may mean that changes are made to the way they operate. Schools will usually let parents know how they are being affected but if you are unsure you should contact your child\u2019s school."

            "text": "If schools need to restrict attendance, we have asked that those schools prioritise vulnerable children, children of critical workers and pupils who are due to take public examinations (like GCSEs) and other formal assessments. Where schools are not able to provide face-to-face education for all pupils, we encourage them to provide remote education to ensure every child has access to learning."
