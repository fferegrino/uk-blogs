We received more than 400 submissions, which was encouraging. Although this did not give us a complete picture of the entire sector, the providers who did respond were accommodating around 70% of the estimated number of 16-17-year-olds living in supported accommodation. This coverage gives us strong evidence on the size and scope of this provision and will help us to manage the demand when we begin receiving applications in April."

The split of accommodation types varied slightly between regions. For example, there was a higher proportion of group accommodation settings specifically for 16-17-year-old children in care and care leavers in London and the East of England. The North East, Yorkshire and the Humber region had a higher proportion of \u2018single occupancy\u2019 settings."

It\u2019s essential that the legal framework equips us to be a responsible and effective regulator. We are very aware of the challenges and pressures that commissioners are facing in finding places for children in care and care leavers to live. We also know that children need a nurturing and safe home environment as they approach adulthood."

To enable us to do so, the law must give us the powers to intervene effectively on behalf of children when children are not being cared for or supported properly. The standards and regulations must allow us to act flexibly and proportionally in this hugely varied and dynamic sector, while retaining high expectations of quality for all types of provision. Regulating and inspecting at the provider-level, for example, is one example of a proportionate system that provides a level of assurance across the provider\u2019s total provision. We can also respond to concerns at a setting-level when that becomes necessary."

We will use our powers responsibly and proportionately but, as you\u2019d expect, our first priority will always be children. All of us who have a role in assuring this system (including providers, local authorities, the DfE and Ofsted) will need to oversee these changes with great care. We must share our insights on the impact, and respond appropriately and swiftly to the challenges that emerge along the way."
