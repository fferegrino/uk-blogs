I was very much arts and design focussed when I was younger but, as I\u2019ve found, you don\u2019t have to be \u2018techie\u2019 to work in tech. It\u2019s why I have been so motivated to get into the classroom to tell students about tech careers. Imagine being at school and hearing that someone from the tax office was coming to teach you about code \u2013 might not sound like the most exciting session? But what if I said a group of digital professionals from one of the UK\u2019s largest IT estates was going to run a session with sphere shaped robots that you had to get round a track (albeit made of masking tape) using iPads?"

The girls were very reserved, but I wanted them to have a go and could see how quickly they were picking up the programming and enjoying the session as they successfully navigated the robot around the track. One girl was a real star and picked up coding so naturally, despite having never done it before!"

I always thought you had to be technical to work in tech, when in fact that\u2019s not the case. Of course we have specialist roles such as software developers, but a lot of our roles like Delivery Managers, User Researchers, Designers, Product Managers... are about people, collaboration, and communication!"

If you are based in the North East and know a school who might like to learn more about digital careers, please get in touch. I\u2019d particularly like to run sessions with under-10\u2019s so we can start planting the seeds for children to consider a tech career when the time comes!"
