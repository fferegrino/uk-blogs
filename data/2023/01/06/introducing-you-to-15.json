My primary responsibility within this is to increase awareness in communities of RPA as an employer and creating new methods and channels for attracting people to RPA. I help to develop targeted marketing programmes and share advice on the experience of candidates to break down barriers faced by those in under-represented groups, supporting RPA\u2019s commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion."

What I enjoy most about this role is feeling like we\u2019re bringing opportunities to those who are facing disadvantage, opening doors to future opportunities by making the Civil Service more visible and accessible."

RPA has already introduced training and tools such as our Farming Calendar and Customer Excellence Training and promoting volunteering within our local communities. I hope to build on this by sharing knowledge and developing connections with land-based colleges, so everyone in the RPA, regardless of their background can better understand the challenges our customers face and the inspiring work they do."
