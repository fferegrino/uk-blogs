Until now, a lot of this had not been documented, but rather existed as general team knowledge. We then used the information we collected to make tough team decisions and prioritise our accessibility work as a list of \u2018activities\u2019."

Improving the accessibility of our design system can help improve accessibility across all of these services."

Once WCAG 2.2 is published, some recent changes to the public sector digital accessibility regulations mean that government-wide monitoring for the new WCAG 2.2 criteria will likely start in early 2024. A design system that aligns with WCAG 2.2 as quickly as possible will make it easier for teams to update their services to meet WCAG 2.2."

Evidence helps us determine urgency and justify the effort to service teams when big changes are made to fix a concern. Evidence can come in the form of \u2018desk research\u2019 as opposed to detailed user testing, however different issues will require different levels of evidence."
