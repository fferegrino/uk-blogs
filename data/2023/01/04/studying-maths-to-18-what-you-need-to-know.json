But at the moment around 8 million adults in the UK have maths skills lower than those expected of a nine-year-old meaning lots of rewarding jobs might not be available to them. Part of the problem is that at the moment only around half of 16\u201318-year-olds study maths. But it goes beyond careers and employment, so many aspects of everyday life \u2013 from managing personal finances to understanding offers in the supermarket \u2013 require a decent level of maths."

We expect them to leave primary school having mastered the basics before going on to apply those fundamental principles to more complex problems in secondary school. Pupils that don\u2019t get a grade 4 or above in their maths GCSE have to resit the exam if they want to carry on studying in a school or college after they\u2019re 16 \u2013 this is already helping make sure fewer young people leave school without basic maths skills."
