            "text": "\u201cI really valued the Lakeland Dairies visit as it brought to life the topics being discussed at recent Northern Ireland Food Advisory Committee (NIFAC) meetings such as the Northern Ireland Protocol. It helped me to appreciate the complexities which businesses in Northern Ireland are having to consider. It was also wonderful to visit such a successful company catering to global customers, just down the road in Newtownards.\u201d"

I have particularly felt this during the last couple of meetings, with substantial agenda items such as the Retained EU Law Bill and organisation in-year prioritisation.\u201d"

            "text": "\u201cI picked the Food Standards Agency as my host board as it felt like the most natural fit due to my experience in nutrition and public health. I am quickly learning that, although an interest in the organisation\u2019s daily operations is valuable, there can be much more complex and crucial topics and decision-making involved in being a board member.\u201d"

The last session was about governance, dealing with legal duties, responsibilities, and liabilities as well as practical arrangements of boards. After Christmas, they will be looking at finance. Judith is hoping this will unlock more knowledge for her which she can then apply in upcoming board meetings."
