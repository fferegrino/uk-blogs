For a public sector organisation this was a bold move; we were used to more formal and rigid structures of giving and receiving feedback."

Our approach helps our leaders really understand their teams \u2013 identifying what makes them tick and helping to harness an environment where everyone can flourish and help to drive high performance."

However, I've found that data gives great real time insight into what is impacting our people.
