To be honest, even when I\u2019m not writing the blog and watching purely for my own entertainment, I can\u2019t help but focus on the intellectual property (IP) in each episode. You can take the girl out of the IPO but not the IP out of the girl!\u00a0"

Levi featured on Dragons\u2019 Den in 2006. With their blend of secret ingredients and unique taste, businesses can use their trade secrets to set their products apart from competitors.\u00a0\u00a0"

If this were the case, Kunal and Nana may want to ask all parties to sign a non-disclosure agreement, to legally protect the confidential information from being shared elsewhere."
