Her proposals have been adopted and she went on to create a bespoke learning and development offer for prison leavers, building a better induction pathway and Lived Experience strategy."

For people like me, we don\u2019t have role models we can look to and think that is something achievable\u2026 What I hope to show people today is that anything is achievable. It really is just a case of hard work and pushing something that you\u2019re really passionate about in the hope of making change and its possible for\u2026 anyone of any background, however you grew up, and your personal circumstances.\u201d\u00a0"

We had so many candidates and it was a difficult judging process. What Tassie has done and the humility she has; she says this is a team effort - is something to be commended.\u201d"

We need equality for everybody across the board for every person no matter where you\u2019ve come from or what you\u2019re facing right now in your life. It's something everyone should aspire towards; being part of a system that pushes and creates change for everyone and unless we have tangible role models that really speak to what change looks like, it's not believable. Hopefully today [at the awards ceremony], winning this award shows everybody that anything really is possible if you put your mind to it.\u201d"
