The red line in the figure below shows that in August 2022, employment was still over 300,000 lower than it was pre-pandemic. The culprit for this reduced employment is increased economic inactivity (people not able to work or not actively looking for work) rather than unemployment (people actively searching for work)."

The increase in inactivity has been more marked amongst older workers and workers without a higher education, as shown in the figure below. Students and long-term sickness are the two reasons for inactivity which have seen the biggest increase since 2019. Despite this, the IFS and others find that increased retirement is a more important reason for the increase in movements from employment to inactivity than increases in ill health."

At the Low Pay Commission, we are most interested in the occupations which employ lots of minimum wage workers. We refer to these as \u201clow-paying occupations.\u201d Retail, hospitality, social care and cleaning are the four biggest low-paying occupations and the table below shows that three-quarters of all minimum wage jobs are in occupations that we define as low-paying. A full definition of low-paying occupations is available in Appendix 4 of our 2022 Report."

The table below reveals a complex picture."

            "text": "The big increase in people leaving their jobs and not looking for another (becoming inactive) happened in better-paying occupations. There were 551,000 more moves into inactivity from better-paying occupations in 2019-2022 than in 2016-2019, but only 11,000 more from low-paying occupations. This chimes with the IFS analysis, which suggests that increased retirement is a key driver of increased movements into inactivity amongst older workers. [2] We would expect workers in better-paying occupations to be more likely to decide to retire as they are more likely to have the pensions and other savings necessary to make that decision. University of Essex researchers found that moves into inactivity amongst older workers increased most for those with mid-level hourly pay [6]."

        {
            "text": "However, increased inactivity is not just due to more people moving out of employment, movements the other way matter too. During the last three years, fewer people moved into low-paying occupations from inactivity. Low-paying occupations are more likely to require interpersonal interactions, so the reluctance of workers to move into these occupations could reflect continued health concerns. Barrero et al. (2022) [7] document evidence that \u201clong social distancing\u201d in the US is reducing the employment rate by up to 2 percentage points. They find that it disproportionately affects low-paid jobs which involve interpersonal interactions. It is possible a similar trend is affecting employment in the UK."

            "text": "Low-paying occupations have also lost workers to better-paying occupations. The net movements (movements in minus movements out) into low-paying occupations from better-paying occupations decreased by 73,000 in 2019-2022 relative to the previous three-year period. This may reflect more workers moving into better-paying occupations to backfill the half a million additional workers who moved into inactivity. In our consultations over the last two years, employers have told us that many workers were moving out of occupations such as hospitality which require evening and weekend work to other jobs with more convenient hours."

The number of jobs paid the minimum wage fell by 21 per cent between April 2019 and April 2022, despite the minimum wage increasing faster than prices (measured by CPI) or median hourly pay over this period.
