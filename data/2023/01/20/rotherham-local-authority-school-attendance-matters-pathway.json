            "text": "A review of EWS and the processes for enforcement action highlighted a variety of issues with the working processes at that time, including the fact that requests for enforcement were being submitted without clear evidence that all strategies to support attendance and wider social and emotional wellbeing had been exhausted."

The pathway to enforcement lacked structure and did not reflect whole family working."
