I\u2019d never worked from home before and now I also had 3 young children in the house. I felt out of my depth as a parent and really isolated. My team were amazing and supported me in any way they could, but I was struggling with being a mum, a home-schooling teacher, and doing my job. I worried that I wasn't putting enough into any of these roles and about letting everyone down. My wellbeing was at an all-time low."

I jumped at the chance to chat with other parents who were probably feeling the same as me. Before long, my passion for the network shone through, and I was asked to become the co-chair, a role I jumped into with joy and enthusiasm."

            "text": "During lockdown, the network created well-being sessions for parents to bring their children along to. We also shared home-schooling tips and gave each other a virtual shoulder to cry on when needed. The wellbeing of our working families was paramount to us as a network, helping us to find balance and highlighting mental health as a priority. We\u2019re continuing this support now in our new hybrid working lives."

            "text": "As our membership continued to grow, reaching over 100 members before the summer of 2022, I began to think about how we could support Companies House as a whole. I created our buddy scheme, an initiative where people can sign up to be paired with a buddy to chat through anything related to wellbeing or being a working family. It can be for 1 session or more, and sessions can be tailored to what you need."

We also challenge discrimination and promote understanding of the difference in people's needs. Above all, we provide a supportive, open space for people to talk and share, and come together to celebrate their successes - something that Companies House embraces too."
