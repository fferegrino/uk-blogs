When an opportunity came up to join the enhancing schools\u2019 commercial capability (ESSC) project team I jumped at the chance.

This is an ambitious project which aims ensure people who buy for schools and MATs in England are more confident and capable when dealing with suppliers and managing contracts."

This pilot - which is free to join - will look at managing contracts at both an individual and organisational level.

We want to see whether it works in its current format or whether it needs some additional work to better meet the needs of people managing contracts in schools and MATs. Participants will play an important role in helping identify any possible areas where the training can be improved to better meet their needs. \u00a0"
