We talk to Shauna who joined us as a case administrator and now works in one of our key probation services officer roles.

I enjoyed working in the prison and reading through the case files, understanding how the system worked and speaking to and shadowing probation service officers. This work gave me a really good foundation of knowledge on the probation services role so I felt confident applying for a probation services officer role when an opportunity came up."

We work closely with offender managers both in prison and the community to understand:"

We co-work with clinicians (psychologists and occupational therapists) and different teams both in prison and the community, including mental health and drug and alcohol services. We also help people learn new skills such as cooking, crafts and setting up things required in a home. The role is a mix of hands-on and desk based, for example carrying out risk assessments and writing reports. Every person is different, so we work alongside a number of other agencies to create tailored plans for people. We typically work with people six months prior to release and up to two years after."

In addition, having good communication skills and being adaptable and resilient are key. It\u2019s also extremely important to be able to work independently as well as within a team."
