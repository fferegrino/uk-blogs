There are principles & frameworks that can be learnt in the form of the agile manifesto, Scrum Guide, Kanban etc. But In the words of Nic Macken \u201cyou don\u2019t learn to drive a car by reading the manual\u201d - the best way to learn to be a Delivery Manager is by doing it."

A theme recently emerged around career moves and progression in digital and the delivery profession. People found constructive feedback and advice very impactful. We thought it would be nice to gather those snippets of wisdom together from the profession as a whole. We started a thread on Slack, and it turned up gold. What follows is a summary of that advice in 7 easily digestible, actionable insights. Enjoy!\u00a0"

There will always be areas that are ripe for improvements, but the skill is in choosing which of those are a priority for you to improve right now, and what can be left.\u00a0"

We can\u2019t start at the end - the utopia of a self-managing team where the delivery manager is redundant - we have to bring people and teams along on the agile maturity journey with us. The journey is not always linear, teams can go backwards in maturity as well as forwards. It's therefore important to apply the right kind of support at the right moment; whether it be directing, delegating, facilitating or coaching. Switching between these different modes of support, or wearing these different \u2018hats\u2019 at the right moment, will help your team navigate the winding path ahead of them.\u00a0\u00a0"

Instead, flex your facilitation skills to surface where differences of opinion exist. Help find a route forward, and share the rationale behind any decisions. It won\u2019t always be possible to get universal agreement, but you can get to a place of mutual understanding & support of the decision if people understand the \u2018why\u2019 behind the \u2018what\u2019."

From facilitating meetings and ceremonies, to maintaining emotional equilibrium in the team during conflict. You can spend a lot of time worrying about making sure you have everything under control for the team, rather than creating the environment for the team to be able to handle problems such as conflict or confusion themselves. Identify whether you are truly facilitating, or trying to steer the outcome. Understand that your colleagues are human and will have emotional responses, but trust that you should give each person the space to have those feelings and provide a healthy and constructive space to do so - rather than controlling them away.\u00a0"

Nurture meaningful relationships with people. Build trust and create ways of working that help people focus on delivering the things that matter most.

This may mean that you need to request a plain english description of the topic at hand so that others in the team can share in the understanding. Your role as a facilitator means that you can ask questions to identify where there are knowledge gaps, but you don\u2019t have to be the one to fill them.\u00a0"

Consider giving the gift of feedback to colleagues around you, or sharing this blog if you found it useful. The key to good feedback or advice is about caring personally and challenging directly - but a whole blog could be written on that! Did any of these pieces of advice resonate with you? Perhaps you can reflect on what changes or experiments you\u2019d like to make with how you work to change things up."
