At the events, children between the ages of 8 and 16 get the opportunity to ask me anything and everything about my role as a product manager at DWP Digital. Being quite a new discipline, there\u2019s not a lot of awareness within the schools of what a product manager does. So, I enjoy being able to spark an interest in the children in something that hadn\u2019t ever previously thought about as a future job.\u00a0"

            "text": "It\u2019s also a great opportunity to educate the younger generation about some of the less techy roles that are available within the digital industry. I deliver workshops that focus on transferrable skills and how, for example, historians make good data analysts as they often start with an idea based on some preliminary research, make some assumptions, doing more research and then refining your analysis or argument along the way. Another example is those involved in sport. Many jobs in STEM - especially digital fields - often require coaches and people who are good leaders. If you\u2019re a team captain for example, then these skills are just as much in demand certainly with emerging roles such as scrum masters and project managers.\u00a0"

So, for this exercise I give the children a sheet of flip chart paper and some pens. I set them the challenge which is usually something like: \u201cYour school is building an app and it has asked you for ideas as to what it will do and look like\u201d. Then we start drawing screens and features with an emphasis on what problems are we solving and why this would be needed. I ask the teams to present back and give the other teams chance to ask questions too. Prototyping on paper is what we do in real product design, so it\u2019s great to see it being done by kids because it shows them that it\u2019s not always technical what we do.\u00a0"

My two favourites are building the tallest structure they can with four A4 sheets of paper and only three bits of sticky tape, and the other is a Lego challenge. This involves the children sitting back-to-back in chairs. One builds something using the first handful of blocks pulled from the tub and the other gets handed the same individual loose pieces. They have to use effective communication so that the child with the loose pieces builds a replica of the pre-built thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

It shows that some of them already have the skills that can be built upon too and gives them a great sense that it would be possible to work in the area.\u00a0"

In Newcastle, almost everyone knows someone who works at \u2018the Ministry\u2019 \u2013 the local nickname for the Longbenton site home to DWP and HMRC. But beyond that, there\u2019s not that much awareness of what actually goes on inside this huge iconic building. So, it\u2019s been great speaking to the younger generation about some of the exciting things that we\u2019re working on here and how our work impacts the lives of almost everyone in the country at some point in their lives.\u00a0"
