We\u2019ve also seen drought declared and extreme rainfall conditions leading to flooding. I felt it that the time is now to take action personally to reduce my carbon emissions where possible."

Simple things like taking my own bags to the supermarket (even before the plastic bag ban), using a refillable water bottle and travel mug, and taking my own box for takeaway food supporting the local village community caf\u00e9. I recycle as much as possible within the local council scheme, avoiding excess plastic packaging and taking soft plastics to the local Co-Op for recycling. I have swapped to sustainable products such as reusable water filter cartridges (changing just the active granules) that are delivered in cardboard and use fabric/washable sanitary products."

We as individuals need to take action to meet the UK\u2019s Net Zero target which sounds daunting. However, the training encourages you to do what you can, not focus on what you can\u2019t \u2013 eliminate, reduce, focus on the actions that make a big difference, and tell others about it to inspire them to action."

With the system predicted to generate an estimated 4172kWh per year1, it will generate enough energy enough for my 3-bed home \u2013 and more. I\u2019ll be able to export what I don\u2019t use through the Smart Export Guarantee, selling back to the grid. Using the Energy Saving Trust\u2019s Solar Energy Calculator2, the system will potentially save just under 1000kg/year with a lifetime (25 year) saving of more than 23 tonnes worth of CO2, the equivalent of how much CO2 would be locked away by 27 acres (or 13.5 football pitches) of forest in one year3. The system will pay for itself in less than 10 years \u2013 perhaps sooner with the current cost of electricity!\u00a0 The installation has just been completed, in late January 2023, and with Spring nearly upon us, the sun will shine brightly on my little part of the world."
