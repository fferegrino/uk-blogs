This enabled field and policy activities to get under way more rapidly, significantly reducing the risk of further spread of disease."

            "text": "As pressures on field operations increased, the laboratory assessed sample positivity seen on the different types of swabs taken from animals, usually poultry, during disease investigations. They were able to demonstrate that oropharyngeal (OP) swabbing (swabbing the back of the bird\u2019s throat) was most sensitive for the detection of HPAI within the whole flock. This meant that the team could recommend that only OP swabs needed to be taken from animals in the field for surveillance activities. This has significantly reduced pressures in the field because staff are able to take fewer samples for testing and so can work more quickly and efficiently, and this has enabled financial savings as well."

        {
            "text": "Furthermore, through their knowledge of how the virus affects the animal host, they were able to recommend a refinement of blood sampling to exclude sampling chickens and turkeys. This meant that technical staff could take samples on the majority of premises, enabling field vets to take blood from waterfowl species as necessary, bringing time and cost savings across the full spectrum of outbreak response."

        {
            "text": "Finally, the team based at Weybridge linked rapidly with colleagues at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) in the diagnosis of influenza of avian origin in a human in the UK. This high-profile case led to countless international press releases and global interest. The team used its expertise to investigate and assess the risk of HPAI spreading from animals to humans (zoonotic risk). This work, along with other activities, has been submitted to high profile scientific journals and really demonstrates the value and importance of the APHA team, in their efforts to reduce the One Health impact from HPAI."
