        {
            "text": "Adding branding on GOV.UK Notify used to be a fairly manual process. Services had to fill in a form that would open a support ticket, and we would work with them to update their branding. If we already had the right logo, we could apply it straight away. If not, we would ask for the logo, text and optional background colour.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "This approach worked when Notify was small, but it didn\u2019t scale well. It also had some other drawbacks: users had to wait to use their new branding, and they had no way to preview email branding before it was set. Once we changed it for them, a user would have to send themselves a test email to see the new branding in action."

This allowed services to choose any branding from their organisation\u2019s pool, as long as we have it on our system. This feature had the most moving parts, and it took us a while to build it all."

            "text": "If we didn\u2019t have a particular logo on our system, a service would still need to open a support ticket to ask us to add it. These are the most complex tickets to solve, because getting a logo in the right quality and aspect ratio can sometimes be quite a task. Also, the user only gets to see their new branding when we\u2019ve already applied it. If they don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s more support work to do, and a longer wait for the service before they can use their new branding.\u00a0"

We had to maintain a balance between empowering our users and maintaining some quality control. After all, poorly-branded notifications can damage recipients\u2019 trust in government communications."

            "text": "We settled on letting users upload and use their new branding straight away, while also keeping an eye on newly-added branding options to ensure they meet quality standards. To make this easy, our app sends a daily digest of new branding options to be reviewed by our team. We\u2019re also happy to help if users need extra support when updating their branding.\u00a0"
