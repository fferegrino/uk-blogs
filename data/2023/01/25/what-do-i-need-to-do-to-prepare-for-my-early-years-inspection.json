Our inspectors are tasked with finding out what it is like to be a child at your setting every day and not just on the day of the inspection. Therefore, we ask that you don\u2019t to do anything differently just for the inspection. In our experience, \u2018preparing for inspection\u2019 merely puts unnecessary pressure on you and your staff to \u2018perform\u2019 on the day. This may result in staff feeling less confidence in knowing that what they are doing is right for their children. And apart from anything else, the children are always the first to tell our inspectors if anything is out of the ordinary for them!"

You should use whatever approach to paperwork suits you and you are free to file it however you like. But please do not be offended if our inspectors would rather understand your plans, policies and procedures by talking about them rather than reading them. We\u2019ve told inspectors not to ask to see paperwork unnecessarily."

As part of fulfilling this aim, we\u2019ll continue to engage with the sector and share our insights from our inspections. One of the ways you can help us is by completing the post-inspection survey. This short survey asks for your views on inspection and the impact it is likely to have in improving your own practice. We use these valuable insights to help us improve what we do."

So if you want to find out about what will happen on an inspection, have a look online. We\u2019ve refreshed our education inspection framework (EIF) and EYFS page, where we address individual aspects of inspection. And if parents of the children you look after have questions, you can point them to the inspection guides that we\u2019ve recently published specifically for them."

We want these resources to be helpful for you. I said at the start, that our inspectors want to know what it\u2019s like to be a child in your setting.
