They also couldn\u2019t resist getting up into the treetops at Go Ape in Cannock Chase, Staffordshire on a team building session."

It\u2019s a continual assessment process with assignments submitted throughout the course and an endpoint assessment interview at the end of the three-year course.\nEach module has a tutor, offering expertise and support, and the programme has its own trainers, myself among them, who you\u2019ll be in regular contact with and who provide ongoing support throughout the course.\nMost of our current apprentices have joined us after a break from formal education. It\u2019s important to remember that only 20% of the course is academic study and 80% is on-the-job training. For most of the time, you\u2019ll be based with one of the Forestry Commission\u2019s area teams for hands-on learning among professionals."

We will help you gain the experience, qualifications and connections that will help you find a job in the industry when the course ends. Our current apprentices joined us from a real mix of professions. We\u2019ve got former teachers, someone from the military, a company director, and IT professionals...what really counts is having a passion for forestry and the commitment to see the three-year course through."

Every eight weeks the group gets together for training, so travel, accommodation and meals for these trips are all taken care of."

On completion, you\u2019ll have a Level 6 Apprenticeship in Professional Forestry, BSc (Hons) Professional Forester, and the potential to be an accredited member of The Institute of Chartered Foresters. You\u2019ll also have valuable first-hand experience and contacts. The Forestry sector is fully supportive of the apprenticeship because there\u2019s a real need for skilled foresters to enter the industry. It will open up some great opportunities."
