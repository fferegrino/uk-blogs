Options for tools include\nJupyterLab and RStudio, as well as lesser known tools like Amazon Web Services (AWS) QuickSight and Theia / Superset. We even have some we\u2019ve built ourselves!"

Another surprise is the\nfreedom for experimentation \u2013 one can follow a whim as to what might\nbe a useful analysis without having to justify it to anyone in advance.\nHaving the proper tools goes beyond the boundaries of what an over-\nstretched spreadsheet can produce and these can be easily shared\nwith colleagues to use themselves. Choosing an appropriate level of\ngranularity can make the same data useful as either an overview or for\ndetailed examination of the data.\n\nOn the topic of support, the Data Workspace team offer a great amount\nof technical support and patience whilst learning to use these tools,\nwhich is very encouraging. Data analysis allows us to accurately\nunderstand a situation and look in the right place for solutions and\nallowing the average user to do this themselves is an extremely\npowerful tool.\u201d"
