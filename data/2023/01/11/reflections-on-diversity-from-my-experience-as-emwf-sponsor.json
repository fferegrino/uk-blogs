I will never be able to fully understand how people in this intersection feel, or the challenges that they face in their careers \u2013 or indeed in many other aspects of their lives.\u00a0\u00a0"

Of course there are strong moral, ethical and social arguments for diversity and inclusion, but there is also a clear business case: diversity and inclusion improves performance.\u00a0\u00a0"

But they will not be solved by an organisation consisting of like-minded individuals that look the same, have the same background, share the same belief structure and the same knowledge base. An organisation that does not reflect the diversity of the society it serves will perform less well.\u00a0"

            "text": "In my field of science, I have seen first-hand the benefits of diversity; the new idea that comes from an unexpected quarter, the challenge to the status quo and received wisdom, the input of a perspective from a disadvantaged group that makes us all stop and think again. I have seen this in discovery science in academia, in my role in industry trying to discover new medicines, and of course on a daily basis during COVID-19. The formation of a subgroup of SAGE (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) that focused on ethnicity and disadvantaged groups was influential in many ways, from biology to behavioural science. Innovative start-up technology companies often actively seek diversity from the get-go, because they know it will help them become successful.\u00a0\u00a0"

Just listening to daily personal experiences and the effects of everyday actions in the workplace makes me realise the energy and determination that is required to do things that as a white male I take for granted. I also work with the Forum to advise on how to approach senior leaders in government and obtain tangible actions from them in order to meet the Forum\u2019s objective of effecting organisational change.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "According to Civil Service statistics, 54.5% of civil servants are women, 15% identify as being from an ethnic minority and 14% identify as having a disability. Looking specifically at science and engineering, the Government Science and Engineering (GSE) Profession recorded that just 31.3% of its members are women, and those who identified as being from an ethnic minority or having a disability were 10% and 8.9% respectively. Although this maps somewhat accurately onto the working population data, people from ethnic minorities aren\u2019t as well represented at higher grades and it\u2019s likely that those at the intersection of two or more disadvantaged characteristics also aren\u2019t represented. Even when targets are reached and the statistics look good, the lived experience of many also suggests that barriers and hurdles to greater inclusivity remain.\u00a0\u00a0"
