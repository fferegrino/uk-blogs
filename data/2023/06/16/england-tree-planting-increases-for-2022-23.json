It is not as simple as just putting trees in the ground but ensuring that they grow to so that we have a resilient resource to help mitigate the climate and nature crisis we face.\u00a0 This is achieved through making certain that woodlands are compliant with the UK Forest Standard (UKFS), thus enabling them to provide these important environmental gains and reducing the likelihood of the negative impacts pests, diseases, natural disasters and other threats can have on a habitat or area."
