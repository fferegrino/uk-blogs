We have primary and secondary schools in the trust who all have a music lead and a range of instrumental teaching, enrichment, ensembles and projects with the local music hub. We are rightly proud that over one third of pupils across the Trust are involved in music lessons outside of the curriculum and attend a musical activity each week."

Music leads have shared examples of singing in their schools and reflected on the journey through nursery to year 6 in how we champion healthy vocal development through a range of curriculum and co-curricular experiences. Through these discussions we were able to agree on future collaborations to develop singing further across our schools."

Recent work has included students performing with the Multi-Story Orchestra and taking part in a song writing workshop in a local cross-sector partnership. Pupils have taken part in orchestral workshops with the hub and have had musicians visit such as a recent opera workshop. As we plan out a programme of activity for the next academic year, we will consider which partnerships can be shared across our Trust to maximise involvement and to bolster collaboration. We are particularly excited that one of our schools will join the Music in Secondary Schools Trust (MiSST) programme in the coming year."

These plans build on our trust-wide ambitions for music, which exceed the expectations of the NPME. The MDP discussions focus on what is our music education offer in each school, and to refine the priorities for the year ahead and for the next three years. As a Trust, we will seek to achieve our ambitions by working in collaboration across our family of schools to share expertise and resource, but also to consider where we can work with local independent schools and our music hubs."

In my role as Director of Creativity, Music and Culture I will support Music leads to deliver their individual plans and through their work, and our trust-wide collaboration, seek to achieve the broader trust-wide goals in our MAT Music Development Plan."
