Remanufacturing equipment is a complete process in which the engineer will use the same specification as when it was originally built, although a combination of reused, repaired or brand-new parts may be used. Component parts that are no longer working will be replaced, along with any elements which are affecting the performance or expected life."

The process itself is less expensive than that of remanufacturing and consists of a thorough check of the IT equipment for defects and restorations. Once the refurbishments have been made, the products will be tested for functionality and defects."
