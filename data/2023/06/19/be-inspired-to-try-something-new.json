When I was young, I was good at maths, so that\u2019s one of the subjects I chose to do for A level, along with geography and computing. Geography was my favourite so that\u2019s what I went on to study at University. Soon after I left, I got a job with the Environment Agency working with lots of engineers. So, I went back to education one day a week to study Civil Engineering."

I\u2019ve helped design new flood defences, used flood models to show the difference they will make and I\u2019ve set up new flood warning areas, so people can receive a free flood warning to tell them to take action before a flooding event."

When thunderstorms are predicted they have vastly different impacts if it happens over a city like Birmingham compared to over rural Warwickshire 20 miles away. Explaining the uncertainty is key to my role. We plan for the worst-case scenario and work with a constantly changing \u2018best estimate\u2019 of what is going to happen."

It will also give them a good idea of where to start looking for that advice when it\u2019s needed rather than feeling lost. The courses do a great job at informing people about what is out there."

With those pointers it gives you a head start and forces you to think about those things upfront rather than having to learn from mistakes."
