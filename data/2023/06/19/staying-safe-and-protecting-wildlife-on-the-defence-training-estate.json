The initiative was set up by Bird Aware Solent and aims to promote safe and wildlife-aware dog walking \u2013 something that\u2019s particularly important at MOD sites such as Browndown, where military training takes place in balance with the maintenance of a rich but delicate coastal ecosystem."

Throughout the day, Coast and Country Canines and DIO staff greeted dog owners and members of the public, and shared friendly advice. There was some great engagement and lots of positive discussions took place about how to keep safe and prevent disturbance to birds and other wildlife that rely on the site\u2019s beach habitat."

However, there are some important rules to bear in mind. First and foremost of these is to always observe flags and signs which indicate training is taking place \u2013 this applies to all of our training areas across the UK."

We also politely ask that people remember to pick up after their dogs. In addition, at sites such as Browndown which provide vital habitats for coastal birds, it\u2019s important that dogs are kept on leads during the bird nesting season which runs from 1st March to 31st August."

The works have been carried out as part of the UK-wide MOD Site of Special Scientific Interest Condition Improvement Project, funded by the DIO Conservation Stewardship Fund."
