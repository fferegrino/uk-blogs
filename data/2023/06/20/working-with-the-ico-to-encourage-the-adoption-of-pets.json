Using PETs could unlock opportunities to harness large sets of data for socially beneficial uses such as scientific research, improving public services, and monitoring fraudulent activity, without compromising on privacy or confidentiality. However, there are several challenges to achieving more widespread adoption of PETs including lack of awareness and relative nascence of these technologies. CDEI\u2019s work to address these issues has included a PETs adoption guide to raise awareness of these emerging technologies as well as the UK-US PETs Prize Challenges for driving innovation in novel PETs for financial crime prevention and pandemic forecasting."

Our tool will help organisations interested in adopting PETs to better understand the costs and benefits involved and point to resources that can address challenges to adoption. This tool will form part of the CDEI\u2019s updated PETs adoption guide, which includes a use case repository, recently updated by the Open Data Institute (who can be contacted at pets@theodi.org for further information)."

Similarly, common concerns emerged around the cost of deploying PETs due to computing costs, regulatory uncertainty and challenges of procurement."

In particular, we would like to understand what factors influence(d) your decisions of whether or not to use PETs and what features would make a tool like this most useful.
