By providing students with an understanding of the importance of our oceans and how to protect them, they will be able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources in the future.\u00a0"

These were then despatched to their twin school so that students could compare and contrast the food chains found in the two locations.\u00a0 It was great to be back in the classroom and a privilege to observe the school children marvelling at the different wildlife found around our coast. Many a student was shocked by the discovery that we have sharks in our waters too!\u00a0\u00a0"

These will be developed and trialled with St Margaret\u2019s before being made accessible to the public via the external Cefas website.
