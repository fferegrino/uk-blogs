Each lawyer\u2019s training is carried out in line with our Land Registration Academy principles, following a standardised training programme with support tailored to their individual needs. The emphasis is on learning by doing, so lawyers are very quickly advising on land registration applications, under the watchful eye of their trainer."

Joining HM Land Registry gave me the perfect opportunity to do this, and I haven\u2019t looked back since."

The in-house training is extremely comprehensive and there is plenty of support and guidance available. Not having any previous property law experience sometimes feels like it helps as I find I often approach problems and issues from a different angle. The work is interesting, varied and challenging, and there are regular opportunities to develop your legal knowledge and skills by taking on work from other parts of the organisation."
