In fact, I have achieved a few promotions to my current Deputy Director role and had a lot of good roles and fabulous colleagues along the way."

            "text": "The 15 years prior to joining HMRC varied greatly. In my early career as a civil servant, I definitely encountered homophobia and hostility and have had to fight prejudice of various kinds. But, at HMRC, I can say with complete honesty that being gay is no barrier to achievement."

Lesbians, gay women, sapphics, we need to be much better about shouting out and supporting ourselves.\u00a0So, let\u2019s start now and worry about ourselves as much as everyone else: affix your own mask before helping others, as the traditional airline safety message says!"

We come in as many hues as any other part of the community and, if as a group we\u2019re a little quieter, we still need your help to include us, support us and lift the whole of HMRC up as a result. So, when you meet someone new, please don\u2019t assume their gender or, if they have a partner, the gender of that partner. Don\u2019t stand for \u201cjokes\u201d or \u201cbanter\u201d that probably don\u2019t feel that way for some of us. Keep HMRC, and the Civil Service, a welcoming, wonderful and diverse place to work."
