But it is not the purpose of this post to set out the story of Section 28 and the damaging effect it had on the lives of millions of LGBTQ+ people in the UK. Twenty years after these regulations were quashed, I think it is fair to say that the British public currently have different attitudes and feel disquiet when they see the same policy enacted elsewhere, like in Putin\u2019s Kremlin."

It commonly refers to all those who don\u2019t fit within societal norms of sexual orientation and gender identity. In this post I mean it in the widest sense. Think of all nine of the protected characteristics. Everyone fits into them somewhere \u2013 a straight, white, 53-year-old man has gender, sexual identity, age and ethnicity. However, if you feel that you don\u2019t completely fit in the mainstream norm, then you might consider yourself a little bit queer. Here are a couple of reasons why you might be a powerful agent for change in government."

The show rails against RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race which has created unprecedented demand for drag performance, but those performers now feel hostage to an army of hen parties and (as the show puts it) their \u2018love of bingo and vomiting prosecco on each over brunch\u2019. There is now a broader public understanding of drag but it is superficial, and the original subversive, perhaps healing, purpose of its performance is being lost."

            "text": "When you consider the type of choices that governments are making, you might recall your economics lessons on the different ways to treat people. The distinction between horizontal and vertical equity goes right back to Aristotle, who said \u201cequals should be treated equally and unequals unequally\u201d. For example, all children get free education (horizontal equity), some children get extra funding for their education like those with special needs (vertical equity). This is a fundamental basic for how we divide the equity share within our society. People in the Civil Service are generally well equipped to develop policies and services on the basis that everyone gets the same, but where they have to differentiate those services for different people it gets much more difficult. This is where it is important to be conscious of assumptions and biases and to prove or disprove them during the policymaking process."

I also went back to my old secondary school as a governor and co-designed their mental health service with today\u2019s students, and helped establish the school\u2019s first LGBTQ+ staff society (the absence of having one being a hangover of Section 28, even 20 years after the law was abolished).
