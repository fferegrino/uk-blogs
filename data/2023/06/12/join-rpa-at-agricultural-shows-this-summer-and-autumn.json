Our presence at these events allows us to have valuable face-to-face contact with a wide range of farmers, gaining their insight and feedback on existing and new schemes, as well as discussing what\u2019s important in their local communities."

We\u2019ll always do what we can to help, or take away queries we can\u2019t answer on the day. We also have a range of leaflets, lots of great literature on CS and the different elements of the scheme, woodland and SFI."

            "text": "Attending shows also allows us to use the insight we gain to influence delivery and inform the development of future schemes. Meeting farmers provides us with unique feedback which influences why we do so many things \u2013 policy, guidance, internal processes. Having this early insight into how the industry is feeling allows us to feed that back into RPA and where we may need to do a little bit more."
