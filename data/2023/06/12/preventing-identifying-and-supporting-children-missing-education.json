Raising awareness of how CME can be identified is vital, as most local authorities (LAs) find it challenging to support children and young people at risk if they\u2019re not already aware of them. \u00a0Maximising CME awareness and training helps to promote the early identification of potential cases."

Robust procedures alongside an understanding of roles and expectations between the local authority and schools/MATs are all components of a strong working relationship that can also be set out in a CME process document."

The LA is typically already aware of these children, through our existing relationship, which enables rapid action to take place to locate and identify the child. Having this regular liaison gives the LA confidence with the systems and processes we have followed, and this has resulted in pupils receiving suitable education and reduced CME."
