This is why we\u2019re going to open a face-to-face route for identity verification in the summer, which will allow users with additional forms of identification to prove their identities to a medium GPG 45 profile and give us our first asynchronous journey!"

I\u2019m happy to say that before Christmas GOV.UK Verify issued its last identity and in March this year, the last service using it migrated away and it has now been decommissioned. We often talk about new features and products -\u00a0 so it's good to be able to celebrate the brilliant efforts, teamwork and collaboration that enabled us to elegantly switch something off. GOV.UK Verify successfully proved the identity of 10m end-users and facilitated 18.6m transactions across 27 services using seven identity providers. I hope everyone who worked on Verify is proud of their contribution."

We\u2019ve been focussed on increasing user success rates from the GOV.UK Verify baseline since we first went into beta last summer. Our user-level data shows that for our most popular service we\u2019re achieving an identity verification rate of 62% which is a huge achievement for a platform that didn\u2019t exist 12 months ago. This is over 10% higher than the target rates agreed with the service before it onboarded.\u00a0"
