            "text": "PESTO, STEEP, PESTLE, GESTE\u2026 whatever your favoured taxonomy for Horizon Scanning [1], these acronyms all work to ensure futurists\u2019 evidence gathering is sufficiently broad, taking into account holistic and macrocontextual change. They help us avoid many research biases and myopia as we lay the evidence-based foundations for futures work. It\u2019s increasingly held wisdom that values (V) should be considered alongside economic (E), sociodemographic (S), technological (T), environmental (E) and governance (G) trends and signals [2]. Sociocultural norms, attitudes and behaviours have just as much influence in shaping our futures as other types of driver and are often underprivileged compared to, say, emerging technologies.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "If VESTEG helps us get our heads around the breadth of change, there is another, perhaps less well-known, framework for making sense of its depth: Pace Layers. Coined by the architect Frank Duffy, Pace Layers was originally an attempt to describe deterioration in the built environment, based on the premise that certain \u2018layers\u2019 (the structure, substrate) have longer life expectancies than others (the skin, the stuff inside). After Duffy, Stewart Brand contended that the relationship between differently-paced layers is \u201chow buildings learn after they\u2019re built\u201d [3]. The fast layers are where most innovation and renewal happen, sustained and stabilised by slow layers, which adapt and adopt over longer time periods.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Futurists became interested in Pace Layers when Brand applied his model to complex systems. In the most adaptable and robust systems, \u201cfast learns and slow remembers, fast proposes and slow disposes\u201d. This is true of healthy civilisations; Brand describes six layers with different change-rates and scales and which together absorb shocks and ensure continuity [4]:\u00a0"

(2018) [4].Each layer should \u201crespect the pace\u201d of the others. When rates of change are confused, the whole system can destabilise. For example, a rapid rather than gradual change in governance and order can bring about catastrophic revolution and disruption in the layers above. If nature is allowed to be driven at a commercial pace, we face the loss of \u201call-supporting\u201d resources (forests, fisheries etc), which sends destructive shockwaves through all other layers.\u00a0"

Here, I want to explore the value Brand\u2019s model in the context of Horizon Scanning, when combined with whatever scanning taxonomy is being used. Rather than simply asking, \u201chow do we categorise X trend?\u201d, Pace Layers encourage us to consider the longevity, or \u2018depth\u2019 of its impact. One might use a hybrid \u2018map\u2019 like the below to plot trends, phenomena and signals.\u00a0"

Something plotted closer to the centre has the potential to influence, or set the context for, other changes (it is more \u2018dominant\u2019). Things at the outer edges will likely be influenced by many other variables (dependent). One might start to draw connections \u2013 actual lines \u2013 between points on the map, exploring the direction of influence and related clusters of change across categories. When developing scenarios to a specific time horizon, mapping in this way can help you draw a distinction between relatively certain contexts and productive uncertainties. For example, 2030 futures will all be bounded by a range of natural/climate and demographic/cultural parameters, but uncertainties in the commerce and infrastructure layers would prove fruitful grounds for exploration via scenarios.\u00a0\u00a0"

Anyone in the business of policy- or placemaking can understand their role in \u2018a longer now\u2019, taking short-term decisions and action while bearing in mind (and hopefully preserving) the health of slower layers. This map can be a tool for \u2018bigger\u2019 storytelling to stakeholders, for setting reasonable expectations about the scope and time frame for returns on investment. Brand uses the example of \u201ceducation [as] intellectual infrastructure.\u00a0 So is science.\u00a0 They have very high yield, but delayed payback\u201d. VESTEG x Pace might prove an antidote to hot and hasty decision-making; we\u2019d be interested to hear how you embed, evolve and experiment with it.\u00a0"
