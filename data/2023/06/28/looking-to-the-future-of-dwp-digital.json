Working with digital experts on innovative projects in an award-winning organisation making a real-life difference is key for me and I truly believe in DWP being able to achieve this through digital."

I\u2019ve benefitted from a proper handover with the former CDIO (Chief Digital and Information Officer), Simon McKinnon. I have visited colleagues across the country in Job Centres, Service Centres, and our hub offices. I have brought my leadership team together for a face-to-face planning day where we agreed objectives for the year ahead and how we were going to build towards achieving these with a renewed outcome focus."

It\u2019s an ambitious plan that will set us up for future successes, and ensure our positive impact continues to be felt by our customers. It places our objectives at the centre of all that we do, it asks for a customer experience focus and ensures that we have transparency throughout DWP for what digital is here to do."
