Alongside this, we\u2019ll be setting up a case study bank with examples of how people have used the different tools and adapted them to their context; and a resource bank of supporting materials. If you\u2019d like to contribute anything to either of these, please get in touch at futures@go-science.gov.uk Big thanks to everyone who\u2019s been involved so far, for providing feedback on drafts and contributing case studies and other materials. Subscribe to this blog for updates on this and our other work."
