Before Covid, I did 10 years running a night kitchen for the largest homelessness centre in London but cooking two hot dinner options and prepping breakfast for 400 guests is small scale compared to our kitchen at Scrubs.\u00a0\u00a0"

Good organisation and teamwork are key in every kitchen but in a prison kitchen, you can see how essential they are. Prisons are disciplined environments, but also very dynamic, and you need to be able to respond to changing needs. Teamwork is paramount.\u00a0"
