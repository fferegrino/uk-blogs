This tag is then attached to a fish box and can be scanned using an RFID reader at any point in the supply chain. Each time a tag is scanned, it registers as a new transaction and the additional information is recorded onto the tag, including where the tag was scanned and the date/time it occurred."

            "text": "Since an RFID tag holds a record of the box weight, when a portion of the contents are transferred elsewhere, the weight of fish that\u2019s been removed is subtracted from the total, so that the contents of the box are tracked at all times - even when the contents are split into multiple portions."
