Within Technology Services we have adopted two core platforms with the needs of users very much at the centre of everything we do. Our aim is to make technology more reliable and resilient while reducing costs and bringing services in-house, where practical."

It doesn\u2019t always make sense to the supplier host but if a viable in-house option that can meet the needs of the application can\u2019t be found, then, there\u2019s no choice. The Landing Zone Team wants to offer a hosting service FOR the MoJ, by the MoJ, which is better, faster, cheaper and well supported while keeping the bar to adopting in-house hosting on the cloud as low as possible."

We adopted a core principle that we wouldn\u2019t mandate, for example, that resources can only be created using code as, if teams didn\u2019t have an infrastructure as code skills, then we have automatically sent them away to host with a supplier! Saying that, we do want to encourage modern practices and use technology well. We\u2019re committed to doing this in several key ways:"

This enables accountability back against audit logs and more accurate recording of work carried out, where previously this could not be done. It removed engineer frustration by allowing concurrent connections, whereby the previous solution limited this to 2 at any given time. This improved resolution times for the users as a result.\u201d"

From a product manager who understands the technology the team offers, and their capability and capacity, to extremely competent and knowledgeable engineers, or I should probably say developers, who always go above and beyond the ask. I recently required some monitoring for a landing zone spoke, and while looking at clickops\u2019ing my way through things, they developed a Terraform module to automate all of that, with detailed and clear instructions to self-serve (if only I knew my way around Github!) and then offered to help when I got stuck, giving me a detailed walkthrough of the solution. It\u2019s a joy working with such an amazing team, thank you.\u201d"

Previously we were monitoring these servers, we couldn't figure out how to configure an alert to send to our monitoring mailbox when a threshold was reached. Thanks to the Landing Zone team, we managed to achieve it and now we get alerts right into our monitoring mailbox and don't have to go to the monitoring dashboard to see what's going on with these servers. Landing Zone team has trained us how to write alert rules using code, now we can update the coding ourselves and once ALZ team approves it from, it will be merged to the main branch."
