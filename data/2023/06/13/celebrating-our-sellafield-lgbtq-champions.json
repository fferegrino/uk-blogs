Pride month is a big shout-out telling the world we exist; we are who we are. But Pride Month is also about educating society on being allies; to help fight the bigotry that\u2019s trying to (and I won\u2019t apologise for using this word) exterminate us from society."

I\u2019d heard the gossip that goes around when other transgender people had come out. It made me apprehensive.
