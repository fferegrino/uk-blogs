The committee therefore recommended there should be a practical \u2018in-service\u2019 evaluation of screening for SCID in English NHS services to answer some important questions."

Without bone marrow transplant treatment, babies with SCID usually die before they are a year old, and treatment is more likely to be successful if SCID is detected early."
