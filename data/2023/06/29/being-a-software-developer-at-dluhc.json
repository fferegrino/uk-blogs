For external organisations who want access to government funding, the process to submit information to DLUHC is designed be quicker and simpler. Organisations that access more than one type of funding should, as more funds use the same platform, get a more consistent user experience across multiple funds. This also means that, when we improve our services, these are picked up by all funds on the platform.\u00a0"
