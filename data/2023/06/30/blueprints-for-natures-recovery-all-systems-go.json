A month later the UK government published its Environmental Improvement Plan, to deliver the Government\u2019s target of restoring nature and improve environmental health. Ambitious targets are welcome, they can focus minds and drive action. But they can feel distant and overwhelming.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

The power to agree priorities and coordinate action is placed in local hands and allows the lining up of public and private funding to have most impact. The priorities that LNRS set out won\u2019t just influence future nature projects, they\u2019ll also help bring nature into other local decisions like where to build, or how to manage public open space. Each of the 48 LNRS areas can play a part in creating new wildlife sites, restoring river systems and peatlands, extending forests, and maintaining grasslands. People can be better connected to nature, and communities better adapted to a changing climate.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

Thirty years ago, Shapwick Heath in Somerset, was a landscape almost devoid of nature.\u202f Now it is a National Nature Reserve and a landscape scale Nature Recovery Project, where large numbers of hobbies visit every year to replenish their energy after thousands of miles of flight. Shapwick Heath is now the heart of a wider nature recovery effort across Somerset. The Purple Emperors were filmed on the Knepp Estate in Sussex, which is at the centre of a growing rewilding movement that is inspiring landowners to think differently about their stewardship of the land.\u202f\u00a0"
