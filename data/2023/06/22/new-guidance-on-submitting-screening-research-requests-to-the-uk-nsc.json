Where possible, we prefer to measure this in one large RCT, to make sure we know what effect the programme has over and above usual NHS diagnosis and care. However, we recognise this is not always possible. For example, a large trial would not be feasible when considering screening newborn babies for rare diseases, so instead we link together other good quality evidence to understand the impact on outcomes."

The aim of research, technical innovation and quality assurance is to minimise these shortcomings. Screening programmes are offered by the NHS to people who have not sought advice on a condition, so it is ethically proper that potential harms as well as benefits are carefully explored and can be explained to individuals."
