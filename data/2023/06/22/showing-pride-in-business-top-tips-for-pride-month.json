Don\u2019t be afraid to ask! - Foster an inclusive culture and build your understanding as much as you can.\u00a0 The LGBTQ+ community is hugely diverse and can take some time to understand!\u00a0 Don\u2019t ever be afraid to ask if people use a LGBTQ+ term you don\u2019t understand, or if you\u2019d like their opinion on inclusivity in the workplace.\u00a0 You might be surprised at how encouraged and grateful they are to have an employer willing to learn!"

            "text": "2. Go beyond the required - Though all workplaces will have equality policies in place, make sure these are put into action, any discriminatory actions are dealt with swiftly, that diversity is truly valued and that everyone can be their true selves in the workplace."

        {
            "text": "3. Offer support where it is needed and have visible role models - Some people may be unsure of their identity, while others may sadly suffer discrimination.\u00a0 Knowing that their workplace is open and offers a safe place to talk will be a great support for these apprentices. Junior employees, including apprentices and work experience students, truly value seeing leaders who are openly LGBT+ as it creates a sense of comfort and aspiration."

            "text": "5. Networks and Allies - Have staff networks or, where you don\u2019t, support your LGBT+ staff to start them up \u2013 setting up a new network, or contributing to an existing network, is a great way for apprentices to really find their place in the workplace."

        {
            "text": "6. Be diverse in your recruitment and aware of labels and pronouns - When recruiting \u2013 senior and junior staff but also apprentices \u2013 make sure your recruitment literature reaffirms your commitment to equality, diversity and LGBT+ staff. People look out for this when joining a company and they want to feel your culture. Be aware that for some in the LGBTQ+ community, labels such as \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cbi\u201d are empowering, for others they are oppressive \u2013 pronouns likewise are a matter of choice."
