In addition, regional water resources groups have produced regional plans that cover all water companies in a region and also include non-public water supply interests. Together the plans set out how they will deliver the Environment Agency\u2019s National Framework for Water Resources, published in March 2020, which provides a picture of England\u2019s future water needs across sectors and by region up to 2050."
