If you\u2019re a landowner, you need to be mindful of who you rent your land to and any rules and regulations that your tenants may need to follow to carry out certain activities. As the landowner, you may also need to apply for permits or exemptions."

This process produces lots of hazardous chemicals and waste which can be highly polluting such as waste oils, fuel, batteries and parts containing mercury, such as switches. Anyone who operates an ELV needs an environmental permit from the Environment Agency and a Scrap Metal Dealers\u2019 Licence from the council to ensure that this process is carried out correctly, minimising any potential impact to the environment."

This is where I step in as an Enforcement Officer. I carried out a joint visit with Greater Manchester Police and found this site was operating an ELV without a permit. I took evidence and provided advice and guidance to the operator about what he should be doing and issued a letter instructing the waste to be removed within 28 working days, in line with the Regulators Code."

            "text": "The site was located next to the River Irk, which regularly floods across the yard, increasing the risk of environmental pollution from the activities that were being carried out on site. The site did not have a sealed drainage system (which it should have if it was a permitted site) and the operator was frequently depolluting vehicles on the floor in the yard into buckets with no lids. Because the site floods, any oil or fuel that was on the floor would be washed into the river."

            "text": "It is also located near a reservoir which is a recognised local wildlife site. It only takes a small amount of oil to cause a massive impact. Just one litre of oil can pollute 1 million litres of water. The oil spreads over the surface of the water in a thin layer which prevents oxygen reaching the animals and plants below the surface. This can lead to fish kills due to the decreased levels of dissolved oxygen and damage the vegetation growing along the riverbanks. Oil can also make water unsuitable for irrigation and damage how wastewater treatment plants work making the water unfit for human consumption."

The landowner also didn\u2019t know that it would fall to him to remove the waste and remediate the site if it had been abandoned by his tenant and caused damaged to the environment."

That would have been a large amount of money for the landowner to find as well as the inconvenience of arranging the site clearance. He was extremely thankful that we were able to help and was very lucky to have a cooperative tenant. Many just disappear, leaving the landowner a victim of their waste crimes."
