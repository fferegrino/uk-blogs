It's extremely well known according to YouGov, and the signature design and logo is instantly recognisable as the trusted source of government information and services. GOV.UK has become truly essential to living, working and studying in the UK."

This includes aligning our app work with the GOV.UK One Login programme\u2019s identity checking app. And, looking across government, it\u2019s only through partnerships with departments that we\u2019re able to provide a consistent and high-quality user experience on GOV.UK, so we\u2019ve created this strategy by engaging with cross-government stakeholders and will continue to partner with them every step of the way."
