            "text": "Across the UK and globally, levels of avian influenza infections in birds and mammals have increased, however, very few human cases of the H5N1 (2.3.4.4b) avian influenza virus have been reported internationally, making it difficult to assess how serious the threat is to human health. To support improved scientific understanding of the threat,\u00a0 in March 2023 UKHSA launched a new asymptomatic avian influenza surveillance programme."

        {
            "text": "This programme aims to detect possible animal to human infections in people who are exposed to infected birds, for example poultry workers and those involved in culling birds in infected commercial and domestic premises, so that we can better understand whether transmissions from birds to humans occur and if so, how often. This information will enable us to better understand the overall risk to human health and tailor our public health response."

            "text": "Individuals taking part in the programme are sampled through virological nose and throat swabs. Samples are then processed by UKHSA testing laboratories, with any positive samples being sent to the WHO designated National influenza reference laboratory in our Colindale lab for genomic analysis."

            "text": "If a positive test is returned, individuals will be managed in line with current UKHSA guidance. As part of the public health response to any positive detections, our health protection teams follow up all individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed human case of avian influenza."

            "text": "The asymptomatic avian influenza surveillance programme has already successfully identified positive tests for potential cases in two people working on an infected poultry farm in England. This scheme builds on a previous asymptomatic testing programme which took place in winter 2021/22, included around 120 samples and identified one positive case with a history of unprotected contact with birds in a close domestic setting."

            "text": "Alongside this asymptomatic avian influenza surveillance programme, we are working with the NHS to ensure patients admitted to intensive care with severe acute respiratory infections, or influenza-like-illnesses are tested for respiratory viruses, including influenza. UKHSA public health labs and the influenza reference laboratory undertake additional testing of samples that are positive for influenza A but where normal seasonal influenza is not found, to confirm that the detection is not due to avian influenza."

            "text": "Monitoring of these samples is an important mechanism for the early detection of avian influenza / novel influenza viruses. As people developing avian influenza infections are likely to be severely ill, intensive care units are a good place to target disease surveillance; this work fits within wider surveillance programmes alongside the existing contact management process, where people who are exposed to birds with avian influenza are monitored by UKHSA Health Protection Teams."
