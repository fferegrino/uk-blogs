Our holistic, person-centred practice enables us to connect carers to local resources like Sefton Carers Centre and support them in the pursuit of life goals alongside their caring responsibilities."

Their mental wellbeing is just as important as their physical health. I am pleased that adult social workers, in tandem with other health and care professionals, understand this duality of support and work hard to strike the right balance."

            "text": "On this point, carers often tell us how important it is to have breaks and to receive emotional and psychological support, not just practical help. While access to the right information helps them better navigate social care and health services, they also deserve the advocacy of those who can protect and promote their rights as carers \u2013 and their human rights more generally."
