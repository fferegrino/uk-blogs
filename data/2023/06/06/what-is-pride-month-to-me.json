These people are at risk simply because of who they are, and who they love."

I hid that part of me deep down and was forced down a path before I was able to choose one for myself.\u00a0"

I was promptly and unceremoniously ostracised from some members of my family."

            "text": "In early jobs, before I became a Civil Servant, I felt deeply anxious and scared about opening up to colleagues and being myself at work. I spoke in vague terms about my home life, shared very little and deflected personal questions. I was worried about discrimination I might face, because although society has made great progress in visibility and acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals, coming out at work still takes great courage and can feel like a risky step to take. I have faced discrimination walking hand in hand with my wife in public, been heckled in the streets and subjected to harassment or even denied entry from venues. But, I have also met the most wonderful people in this life and shared joy in finding community.\u00a0"

I\u2019ve found the Civil Service to be a safe and welcoming place, where I can be my authentic self at work. That means when someone asks me about my weekend, I can say I spent it with my wife, with no shame or fear of judgement. I can speak freely and share all those overlapping and intersecting parts of my life without having to carefully dissect out elements. And this is important.\u00a0"

For transgender people meanwhile, gender affirmation has been found to be a significant positive factor in mental health and can save lives. So, this June I invite you to celebrate Pride Month, not only for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies but also for all marginalised communities."
