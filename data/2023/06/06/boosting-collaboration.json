At first, I was intimidated by how mature most of the DfE service teams were. But I soon learned that developing teams is an ongoing process and everyone has a part to play."

            "text": "I began by setting up a channel for user researchers, content designers and interaction designers. This channel was largely self-sustaining, with colleagues from different teams asking each other questions. Our professions overlap, so this channel also became the epicentre of team-level changes that had real impact. For example, advocating to adopt Figma for sharing designs with the wider team."

Having this collaborative channel was helpful to workshop ideas - be it around ways of working or decisions around tools. Once issues were raised, we could act to prioritise them and champion them in conversations with our wider teams, and in sprint events such as retrospectives."

Having advocated as a group to move from Lucid to Figma, we put our proposed designs on a digital whiteboard and used themed \u2018buckets\u2019 to sort comments, creating a list of actions in order or priority. Figma was better for us due to improved user-friendliness and it being easier for guests and contractors to access for collaboration purposes."

            "text": "The best compromise was to establish a \u2018window\u2019 for comments with a hard cut off period of 24 hours before testing. This gave UCD colleagues a reasonable amount of time to review and respond instead of being rushed, which would compromise the quality of our data."
