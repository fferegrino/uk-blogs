It\u2019s the last one of those that I\u2019m focusing on with this Blog, in terms of my role caring for my youngest daughter, who was diagnosed as Type 1 Diabetic, aged five, in 2015."

            "text": "Becoming a carer, and shortly afterwards separating from my husband to become a single parent to my two young girls, meant I quickly had to adjust my priorities. Of course, my first priority was to support her, and to increase my own understanding of how to manage the condition, so I did a lot of research, and learned how to count the carbohydrates in her food to calculate her insulin doses, and to support her school to do the same. Unfortunately, blood sugar is not only impacted by food, but also by exercise, hormones, the weather and adrenaline so it can be quite tricky to manage!"

I wrote a 10-page document on \u201chow to keep my child alive\u201d, giving all the instructions, phone numbers, settings that I could think of, and sent it to my parents and her dad."

            "text": "With extra time at home, and the transition to secondary school looming, I gradually began encouraging her to take more responsibility for managing her condition herself. Combined with new hybrid closed loop insulin pump technology, this helped to reduce the pressure (and reliance) on me and, once she was settled in Year 7, enabled me to focus a bit more on myself and my career aspirations again."

My daughter and I had never met anyone else with T1D before this, so it was a revelation, and also a lovely way for both of us to make friends that \u201cgot it.\u201d"

I knew it had a reputation for being a flexible and caring department, which I\u2019m pleased to say has proven to be the case. I have felt able to provide her with the support she needs, to take time out to monitor her blood sugar levels, speak to her school and attend her medical appointments."
