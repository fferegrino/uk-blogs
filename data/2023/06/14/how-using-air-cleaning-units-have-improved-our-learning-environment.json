CO2 monitors help make us aware when ventilation is poor and when it is at a healthy level \u2013 this helps us identify when it is beneficial to have the windows open to let fresh air in, or close them to keep warm (and save energy). They\u2019re simple and easy to use, cost-effective and there has been no real maintenance.\u00a0\u00a0"

They\u2019ve been a game changer - they help control the spread of infection, helping keep our learners and teachers well. These now sit in the older classrooms and a mobile classroom. They\u2019re placed out of the way and the floorspace they take is minimal with two per classroom.\u00a0"
