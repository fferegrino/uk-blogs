It is also an opportunity to reflect on the importance of inclusive social work practice when working with individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\u00a0 Adopting good social work practices is crucial for providing effective support and creating a safe and affirming environment for LGBT+ individuals."

            "text": "I went to see a wonderful play, Es and Flo, \u00a0at the Kiln theatre last week.\u00a0 This is the story of two women who have lived together as long lasting lesbian partners for 40 years having met at the Greenham peace camp in the 1980s. Es is developing dementia and\u00a0has always found it too shameful to be open about her relationship, including with her only son. She still lives with the fear she had in the 80s of losing her job as a head teacher when Section 28 laws hung heavy over our community, as well as fears about losing contact with her son if the courts knew she was a lesbian."

            "text": "The poignant layers of her love for her partner and the fulfilling life they have had, her shame and fear, Flo's frustrations, who has felt invisible to the outside world and her anxiety of losing her home, which is in Es\u2019s name, tensions about how Es's wishes should be met, all make for great theatre."

            "text": "However the most remarkable aspect for me , was the skill and inclusive practice of the social care worker supporting Es and Flo.\u00a0This character demonstrated fundamental principles of social work and good social care practice.\u00a0Creating positive relationships and an inclusive environment that respects and values the unique experiences and identities of all individuals."

By demonstrating the core skills of social work practice, genuine empathy, actively listening, and using inclusive language, social workers and social care staff can help build trust and foster open communication. This supportive environment enables LGBT+ individuals to feel comfortable sharing their stories, concerns and aspirations."

When working with LGBT+ people, as social workers we should be mindful of their diverse experiences and challenges, taking into account factors such as race, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status. By adopting an intersectional lens, we can provide more nuanced and comprehensive support, considering the complex dynamics shaping their lived experiences."

This can include advocating for inclusive policies, supporting legislative efforts, and collaborating with community organizations. By actively engaging in advocacy work, social workers can help challenge oppressive systems and promote equality, justice, and social inclusion for all."
