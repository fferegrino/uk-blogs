Where AI systems produce unfair outcomes for individuals on the basis of these protected characteristics and are used in a context in scope of the Equalities Act 2010 (e.g. the provision of a service), this might result in unlawful discrimination."

Fairness encompasses a wide range of issues, one of which is avoiding unfair bias, which can lead to discrimination."

Intermediaries could help organisations navigate regulatory complexity, better protect user autonomy and privacy, and improve user experience and data governance standards. However, the overall market for data intermediaries in the UK remains nascent, and the absence of intermediaries offering this type of service may reflect the difficulties of being a first mover in this complex area, where demand is unclear and the risks around handling demographic data require careful management.\u00a0"

For example, an individual\u2019s forename gives some information about their gender, with the accuracy of the inference highly dependent on context, and the name in question. There are already some examples of service providers using proxies to detect bias in their AI systems.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "Proxies have the potential to offer an approach to understanding bias where direct collection of demographic data is not feasible. In some circumstances, proxies can enable service providers to infer data that is the source of potential bias under investigation, which is particularly useful for bias detection. Methods that draw inferences at higher levels of aggregation could enable bias analysis without requiring service providers to process individually-identifiable demographic data.\u00a0"

            "text": "However, significant care is needed. Using proxies does not avoid the need for compliance with data protection law. Further, use of proxies without due care can give rise to damaging inaccuracies and pose risks to service users\u2019 privacy and autonomy. Therefore, we argue that inferring demographic data for bias monitoring using proxies should only be considered in certain circumstances, such as when bias can be more accurately identified using a proxy than information about an actual demographic characteristic, where inferences are drawn at a level of aggregation that means no individual is identifiable, or where no realistic better alternative exists. In our paper, we suggest risk mitigations and safeguards that organisations should consider if using proxies.\u00a0"

Where this isn\u2019t feasible, use of proxies may be an appropriate alternative, but significant care is needed. However, there is an opportunity for an ecosystem to emerge that offers better options for the responsible use of demographic data to improve the fairness of AI systems. This ecosystem would be characterised by increased activity in the development and deployment of different solutions that best meet the needs of service providers and service users, as well as ongoing efforts to develop a robust data assurance ecosystem, ensure regulatory clarity, support research and development, and amplify the voices of marginalised groups.\u00a0"
