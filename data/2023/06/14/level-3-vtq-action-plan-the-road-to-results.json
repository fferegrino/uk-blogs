This means awarding organisations have a complete and accurate picture of student entries to track progress against. Ofqual heard many examples where these early checks helped awarding organisations, schools and colleges identify problems; for example, where personnel had recently changed and emails were therefore unmonitored. It proves that these checks are important. It is much better to discover any issues now than in August. We also heard views on how to make these checks more streamlined. Your feedback is important and we are making sure that lessons are learned not only from checkpoint 1 to 2, but with a view to ongoing arrangements. \u00a0"

It is also important that awarding organisations know if students change their plans. Please work with awarding organisations to ensure all student records are up to date. If a student chooses not to cash in their units, requires more time for assessments, or changes their mind, they may no longer be eligible for a result this summer. Awarding organisations need to know this, so that they can accurately track progress and know which results are still expected.\u00a0\u00a0"

It is important to note that schools and colleges could face investigations or even sanctions if they do not cooperate with requests for information or miss deadlines. Individual or repeated instances of this could be considered a form of maladministration which could result in awarding organisations issuing warnings, suspensions, withholding student results or even centre approval being withdrawn. Ofqual will shortly be writing to all Heads of Centre to remind them of their responsibilities in this matter. Further information should be available in each awarding organisation\u2019s malpractice policy on its website.\u00a0\u00a0"
