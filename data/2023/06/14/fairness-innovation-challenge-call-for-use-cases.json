Our 2020 Review into bias in algorithmic decision making set out recommendations for government, regulators, and industry to tackle the risks of algorithmic bias. In 2021, we published the Roadmap to an Effective AI Assurance Ecosystem, which explores how assurance techniques such as bias audit can help to measure, evaluate and communicate the fairness of AI systems.\u00a0"

They will help guide participants through some of the legal and regulatory issues, as well as using learnings from the challenge to shape their own broader regulatory guidance on these issues."
