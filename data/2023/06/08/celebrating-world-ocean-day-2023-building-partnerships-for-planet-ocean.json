The book highlights the significance of the Allis shad as a flagship species for the Tamar region, stressing the importance of conserving its habitat. The book's sales will contribute to the conservation efforts of the Westcountry Rivers Trust (WRT). Through intricate illustrations, Sarah Gledhill brings local scenes and wildlife to life, providing an enjoyable way to celebrate these extraordinary fish and educate adults about the critical need to care for freshwater habitats that sustain countless species."

Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) have emerged as a crucial strategy to safeguard vulnerable and ecologically significant areas in our ocean. Natural England have supported Defra in the identification and designation of HPMAs in our English waters. \u00a0HPMAs impose restrictions on activities, removing pressures, creating safe havens for marine biodiversity, allowing marine ecosystems to regenerate, species to recover, and habitats to flourish."

Marine and Coastal Wildlife Code: Natural England, in collaboration with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), has contributed to the development of England's first-ever national Marine and Coastal Wildlife Code. This comprehensive code offers valuable advice and guidance for responsible visits to the coast. Created in partnership with organisations such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the Shark Trust, and the Cornwall Seal Group Research Trust, the code provides specific guidance on activities like coastal walks, kayaking, paddleboarding, and jet skiing. It offers insights into breeding seasons and helps visitors understand how their actions can minimise disturbance to seabirds, seals, dolphins, sharks, and turtles. This initiative builds upon the existing Countryside Code, ensuring enjoyable and safe experiences for coastal visitors."
