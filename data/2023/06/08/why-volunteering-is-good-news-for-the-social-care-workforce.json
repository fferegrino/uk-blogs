Before the pandemic, many volunteers came in to help with the many activities laid on in our homes. Lockdown stopped that. Even though some volunteers were able to continue, COVID-19 restrictions meant volunteering inside our home ground to a halt."

We were looking for \u201cChatty Companions\u201d \u2013 people who could spend time with residents on a one-to-one basis, doing puzzles, reading newspapers and helping residents stay in touch with the outside world."

            "text": "We also looked for people to help the wellbeing team with various activities, including music, arts and crafts, quizzes and debating, and inspiring residents to join the fun. And we wanted people to help with the many outings we provide. We promoted this in local media and on social media and received a fantastic response."

This, in turn, leads to improved physical health, reducing the need for medical intervention, which eases workload pressure on care staff."

            "text": "Not all our volunteers are based in the home. We recently launched a Telephone Friendship Service. Volunteers call veterans and their partners who live in their own homes, anywhere in the country. The aim is to provide support and a friendly voice to someone who is feeling lonely or isolated, or who would simply like a chat."
