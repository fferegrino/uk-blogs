We also support analysis and data visualisation projects and run bootcamps to train others across the department in our tools.\u202f\u202f\u00a0"

This year, 7 projects were chosen and over 140 colleagues from across DBT attended the Awards and Showcase Ceremony. The challenge provides a wonderful opportunity to develop new data and digital skills, work with different teams and highlights the innovative work happening in\u202fDBT.\u202f\u00a0"
