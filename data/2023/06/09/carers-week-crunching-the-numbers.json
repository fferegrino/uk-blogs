Employers can take the opportunity to talk about unpaid caring with employees and a lot are doing just that during Carers Week. Including a simple question on a staff survey can make all the difference to understanding your colleagues and staff, which we know to be true from our 230 strong Employers for Carers forum."

For some it will be fleeting and short.\u00a0For others, it will be long term and very significant over time.\u00a0None of us can predict when, how or what will happen, but we need society and systems around us to make sure we have the best support available.\u00a0That\u2019s why you could make a difference for Carers Week this year by making saying I Care and doing something practical to support unpaid carers."
