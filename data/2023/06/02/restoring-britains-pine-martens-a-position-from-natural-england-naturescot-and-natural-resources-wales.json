Translocations play a part in that and we have been working with NatureScot and Natural Resources Wales to encourage a science-led, strategic approach. This blog post explains our joint advice on how projects can best approach pine marten conservation."

            "text": "We have worked with each other and partners over many years to develop best practice and have supported well planned conservation translocations that have clear conservation benefits and take account of people\u2019s aspirations and concerns. Many such projects have taken place, some of them involving translocations between the different countries of Britain, to help recover nature across our islands. For example, vendace, ospreys, white-tailed eagles and Eurasian beavers have all been translocated from Scotland to England, and pine martens to Wales and England. Vendace have also been translocated to Scotland from England. In all cases we expect practitioners to apply the IUCN Guidelines for reintroduction and other conservation translocations and the associated national codes."

            "text": "The pine marten was once widespread and common across Britain but is now rare and recovering3. Pine martens are generalist omnivores, eating a wide range of different food species. They predominantly prey on small mammals such as field voles, and this usually consists of up to 50% of their diet. \u00a0Their diet preference is determined by what is locally most abundant."

        {
            "text": "Predators are a crucial part of a functioning ecosystem. A diverse predator community is expected to naturally limit populations of abundant prey populations. However, pine martens by themselves generally live at low density; a population of one per km2 is considered a high density, and a pair of martens generally need at least 200 ha of suitable woodland4."

We have a responsibility to conserve pine marten populations and to the local communities who currently host these populations, to balance the aim of improving the conservation status of the species throughout Britain, while ensuring that the Scottish population is not harmed by taking too many, and too quickly."

The restoration of the pine marten to the south-west of England and promoting the natural recolonisation of south Cumbria from southern Scotland are currently regarded as the priority."

However in all countries, pine martens are fully protected, and the capture, possession or transport of wild pine martens requires a licence to be issued by the relevant statutory agency.\u00a0 For releases in England, pine martens originating from populations outside Britain are judged by Natural England to be sufficiently distinct that they are subject to the controls in section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Their release into the wild is therefore unlawful."
