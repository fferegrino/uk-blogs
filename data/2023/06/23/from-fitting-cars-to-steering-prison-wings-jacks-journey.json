My main worry was my first day, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Everyone made an effort to introduce themselves and let me know what their roles were. You\u2019re not left on your own, you\u2019re shadowing people and soon realise there\u2019s a lot more going on behind the scenes. It\u2019s a massive group effort which requires good communication.
