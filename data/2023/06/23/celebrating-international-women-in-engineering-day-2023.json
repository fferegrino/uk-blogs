            "text": "Today, 23rd June 2023, marks the 10th International Women in Engineering Day, brought to you by the Women\u2019s Engineering Society (WES). As a woman working in Engineering, there are times I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m one of few women in the room. This isn\u2019t surprising, with figures from June 2021 showing that just 16.5% of engineers are women. #INWED23 aims to give women engineers around the world a profile when they are still hugely under-represented in their professions. The theme for this year is #MakeSafetySeen, focusing on the women who keep us safe at work, home and online."

Not only in the way we develop products, processes, and solutions but in our approach to problem-solving and scientific discovery. As a mechanical engineer, I have always enjoyed observing and learning from nature\u2019s innovations and their flexible yet elegant evolution. Driven by curiosity, this creates a constant organic flow from scientific discovery towards innovative solutions in our engineering approach.\u201d \u2013 Dr Sepideh Khodaparast, University Academic Fellow."

So every day and every problem is interesting and a fun challenge. Plus, the answer always involves something technical and something about people \u2013 what a great mix!\u201d \u2013 Prof. Barbara Evans, Professor of Public Health Engineering."

My work looks at how environmental factors, such as ventilation and room layout, can influence transmission. I am currently working at GO-Science on the GSE Profession team as part of the UKRI Policy Internship scheme. I have a strong interest in science policy, and I am keen to work in the field after my PhD."
