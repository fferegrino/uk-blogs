            "text": "Writing a piece to mark International Women in Engineering Day is a privilege and something I can totally relate to but when I was initially asked to contribute, I felt an overwhelming sense of panic. It is an area I am particularly passionate about and have undertaken my own research on construction and engineering (now published), so why did I find the idea so daunting?"

            "text": "I realised the answer lay in my own personal journey to get to where I am today, maybe contributing to a sense that I was not a true engineer and therefore unqualified to share my views. Like many other women, my career progression has not followed a linear path; it is full of zig zags and turns. In school, I excelled at maths and science, so I was encouraged to study engineering even though teenage me did not really understand what that meant. My ambition at the time was to earn enough money to travel and have a job where I could wear a suit."

            "text": "I started university studying chemical engineering. Chemical engineers had the highest pay according to my school guidance counsellor, so it seemed the obvious choice at the time. I enjoyed the subject matter, especially organic chemistry, and I revelled in being the only woman in my sorority revising fluid mechanics."

            "text": "However, in my penultimate year, I was involved in a car accident that changed the course of my life. Instead of taking the rest of the year off to recover from the accident and a severe concussion, I went back to university, determined to continue with my studies. But something in me had changed. The accident made me realise that life is short, and you should spend those precious moments doing what interests you most \u2013 so I made some drastic changes."

        {
            "text": "I moved away from engineering towards health sciences and toxicology (I wanted to work in public health). I decided to travel straight after university. My goal to wear a suit went out the window. Travel took me twice around the world before I settled in the UK. With not much money and desperate for work, I took the highest paid temporary role available: project administrator on a construction site. Little did I know that this seemingly inconsequential choice would lead to a rewarding career in construction and engineering."

This will complement the outreach activity that APHA scientists are already involved in."
