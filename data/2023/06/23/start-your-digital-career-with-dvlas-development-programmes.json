When I discovered the MSc programme, I found that the learning opportunities were much better than other entry level software engineering roles. I also liked the idea of starting my first software engineering role as part of a cohort, so we would be able to support each other."

I\u2019ve found it very rewarding to apply my newfound knowledge within teams and working through the programme alongside a cohort has also added to the experience.

The skills and knowledge I\u2019ve gained at university seamlessly translate into my role on the squad and have proved vital in my growth as a Software Engineer. I have now settled into my squad, and enjoy working collaboratively to complete tasks during sprints. Completing real-life tasks and learning from other members of the squad has been the most enjoyable part of the programme so far."
