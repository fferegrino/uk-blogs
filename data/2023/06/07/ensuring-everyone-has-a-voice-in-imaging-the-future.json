But how do we ensure that decision-makers are able to take into account the needs, hopes and fears of some of our least heard communities when thinking and planning the future scenarios we need to help us achieve this goal? In our report Inequality in a Future Wales we called for new ways of working which could take us towards a more equal Wales, and avoid taking decisions which could inadvertently exacerbate inequality in vulnerable communities. But what would this way of working look like?"

The Communities and Climate Change in a Future Wales project had a dual function: to provide useful insight on a topic which affects all public bodies in Wales and beyond, and to provide detailed methodological insight and resources which would inspire and support other bodies to conduct their own participatory futures work."
