Before I was a civil servant, I spent a decade working in the area of textile and clothing sustainability. I recently told the participants in some workshops I was running: \u201cyou\u2019re lucky to have me: I\u2019m interested in waste, I\u2019m interested in the work that you do, and I\u2019m interested in making things better\u201d."

The hubs are also for all Defra colleagues (rather than just for some roles), which makes it easier to collaborate on policy as well as delivery."
