We prioritised year 10 pupils who were eligible for pupil premium and provided tutoring in GCSE English language and maths. Since then, our tutoring model has evolved to use different tutoring routes. In the current academic year, we\u2019re delivering school-led tutoring and have employed an academic mentor to focus on raising attainment in reading and literacy of pupils in key stage 3. In total, 325 pupils have started tutoring courses."

            "text": "The combination of school-led tutoring and academic mentors has had a positive impact on academic attainment and increased pupil confidence. In the 2021 to 2022 academic year, the first full academic year of providing tutoring via the NTP, 93% of our pupils who received tutoring confirmed that they would recommend tutoring to others. Most pupils felt that the support was helping them to make progress in their targeted subject areas."

In some subjects, pupils who were tutored improved by almost a full grade."

            "text": "We strongly encourage schools to use an academic mentor. Our academic mentor works with students both within class and in small groups. Pupils receive intensive support and get the opportunity to ask questions, which helps develop their knowledge and understanding that may be missed during the busy environment of a lesson. The strong relationship the academic mentor has with the students helps them build confidence and enjoy the subject."

            "text": "Our experienced staff have guided the academic mentor as they adopt the most effective ways to support students\u2019 needs. Before we introduced the NTP, we already had a set of academic coaches who worked with students to accelerate their academic progress. As such, we were well equipped to embed the academic mentor into our team of coaches, allowing our current staff to upskill them on the methods that work well to support students\u2019 progress and attainment at Wood Green Academy."

We have full control of the tuition that is delivered to our students, ensuring high-quality teaching is delivered in a safe, secure and familiar setting. We have also been able to offer greater flexibility to both students and staff, offering the option to participate during both term-time and school holidays. In turn, this flexibility has meant more students and staff are participating in the programme."

We are extremely confident in our ability to accurately identify the priority areas for all our students. Pupil engagement is key to the success of our tutoring programme. For this reason, we seek feedback from pupils on their perception of the helpfulness of tuition. It\u2019s also important to keep track of the impact that tutoring is making on their academic attainment."
