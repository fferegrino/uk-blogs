Screening saves thousands of lives every year by checking\u00a0for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes nearly all cervical cancers. \u00a0"

A study was set up in 2021 in England as a first step in finding out if vaginal self-sampling could be offered as an alternative option alongside the traditional clinician-taken cervical screening test. \u00a0"
