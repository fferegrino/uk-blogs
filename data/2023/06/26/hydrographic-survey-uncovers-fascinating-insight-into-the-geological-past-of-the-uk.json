Global cooling at the start of the last glaciation allowed embryonic glaciers to form over high ground across Great Britain and Ireland. As conditions cooled, glaciers continued to grow, coalescing and flowing radially outwards, away from the mountains and across the lowlands and continental shelf to form the British-Irish Ice Sheet. Around 27,000 years ago, the ice sheet covered an area of 840,00 km2 and contained enough ice to raise global sea levels by 1.8 m(1)."

Several very large glaciers, known as ice streams, drained ice from the mountainous areas down to the ocean, calving icebergs into the Atlantic. These huge marine-terminating outlet glaciers flowed at speeds of several kilometres a year, analogous to the largest glaciers in present-day Greenland and Antarctica(3)."

These mounds of glacial sediment can be tens of metres high and hundreds of metres long, and are generally elongated in the direction of ice flow. In profile, drumlins often have a blunt upstream or \u2018stoss\u2019 side, and a tapered downstream or \u2018lee\u2019 side. Drumlins only form beneath thick, fast-flowing ice. Their presence indicates that the Irish Sea Ice Stream was over 1000 m thick here and was flowing at speeds of several kilometres a year when these features were created."

These ridges are ribbed moraines(4), also known as \u2018Rogen moraines\u2019 after the spectacular example found around Lake Rogen in Sweden. The origin of both drumlins and ribbed moraines have been hotly debated, but it is now generally accepted that these features are part of a continuum of subglacial landforms, formed by pattern-forming instabilities as glacial ice, and deformable layers of underlying sediment, behave like fluids during glacier flow."

These are likely recessional moraines, marking still-stands or brief pauses of the glacier front during general retreat at the end of the last ice age. They indicate that as ice retreated from this area around 20,000 years ago, it was still grounded, or in contact with the seabed, and the glacier system had not thinned enough to float."

However, there are still plenty of areas for further research, and this new data may help resolve some of them. In time, surveys like this will be fully analysed by glacial geomorphologists and added to maps of ice sheet landforms."
