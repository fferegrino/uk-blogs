He was diagnosed with high functioning Asperger syndrome in 2016, when he was in his early 40s.\u00a0 We discussed how this affects his daily life, the misconceptions about Asperger\u2019s and how managers and colleagues can be more supportive. Thank you Dean for taking the time to shed light on your experiences."

So it's good to keep it on track. And this involves a different kind of social interaction. Every interaction has a goal. It's not open-ended. It can't go off in a million directions. You've got set information that you need and your questioning is around that. This research can happen via email and it allows me to become a subject matter expert, which is great for me."
