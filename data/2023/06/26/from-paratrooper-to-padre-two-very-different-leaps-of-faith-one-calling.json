My low point was when a medical issue prevented me from attempting Pegasus Company, (aka P Company) the organisation that run the test week and build up exercises for those in selection to join the UK Airborne Forces. Continuing was difficult but I had the determination to achieve my aim and join the regiment and with a supportive chain of command, we were able to resolve the issue and I passed on my first attempt. Besides, any low points were vastly outweighed by the deep satisfaction on earning the famous maroon beret and parachute wings.\u00a0\u00a0"
