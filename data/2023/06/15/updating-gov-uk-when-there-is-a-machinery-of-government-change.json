This made it clear to users what was happening and allowed us to focus on the backend tasks that affected public-facing content. We also had to wait for external decisions on things like new branding colours and crests to be confirmed before we could set them up for government publishers to start using."

For example, the new Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was a relatively simple change as we were passing their \u2018digital\u2019 content on to a new department. To handle this work, we split into smaller support teams and worked on individual roadmaps based on communications with departments. This agile approach allowed for more flexibility and gave us more time to investigate blockers and problems that were unique to each department without holding up other departments."
