The first means of transport making use of two wheels arranged consecutively, and thus the first bicycle, was the German draisine, or dandy horse, dating back to 1817. A few years later the term bicycle is believed to have been coined in France, in the 1860s."

After an hour on the road I\u2019ve had every thought in my head, remembered (and forgot), every errand, mulled over every work problem, and had every silly idea that\u2019ll never be followed up. After that, it\u2019s just the road, the landscape, me, and my bike, and maybe the odd pothole. Those are the days when I\u2019m a cyclist."

Every little helps, and I have seen for myself that the more people normalise doing a quick errand on a bike rather than a car, the more familiar cyclists become as part of the road users. There\u2019s some safety in numbers, and then there won\u2019t be cyclists, there will be persons - motorists, pedestrians, mums, dads, kids, colleagues - on bikes."

I live in York and frankly, taking the bike is just the quicker option. No getting stuck in traffic. No searching (and paying) for parking. The ease of cycling past a shop and just stopping off for a pint of milk - a few minutes. Or popping to the supermarket during rush hour without this being a problem."

There\u2019s one element though that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet, and that\u2019s the opportunities it presents for how I can raise my kids. I grew up in the Netherlands, where it went without saying that kids from a young age could go about their town independently - to school, to friends, to a sports club, back home again."
