            "text": "If we become unable to do these things for ourselves, this often becomes the responsibility of health professionals, even when the activity does not need the knowledge and expertise of a nurse. Is this the only way to support people? Or would delegation of some of the activities to others who care for an individual give better outcomes? I think it could if delegation is seen as an innovative choice rather than a way to manage scarce resources."

            "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, when we wanted to minimise the number of people each of us saw, nurses enabled and encouraged us, as care staff, to support our service users with wound dressings, insulin management, physiological readings etc."

            "text": "When the pandemic was over, many of us wanted to carry on doing this work, if done safely and the extra contribution and responsibility was recognised. If delegation is done properly it can give the person who draws on care and support more control as well as giving care staff opportunities to develop."

            "text": "Delegating some of the more routine aspects of healthcare can give our skilled health colleagues more time to devote to those who need their knowledge and expertise \u2013 perhaps they have a newly diagnosed issue which they need help to manage effectively."

        {
            "text": "It also means individuals can manage their condition rather than the other way around. If a dressing comes off in the shower, it is much more dignified for the individual if the carer helping with the shower can replace it, if appropriate, rather than wait for the nurse and get undressed again."
