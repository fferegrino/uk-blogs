It's not only a chance to shine a light on our psychological wellbeing (and how to maintain it) but also take stock on mental health service provision and the evolution of societal attitudes to an issue which affects us all."

            "text": "Much progress has been made since the Time to Change national campaign, Time to Talk Day. This wonderful social movement\u2019s continuing mission is to challenge and one day end the stigma and discrimination faced by those of us who experience mental health problems."

            "text": "These days, many more people understand the more common mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and are able to seek help. Research by the Mental Health Foundation, reaffirms the reality that everyone has a different experience of anxiety, which can be triggered by significant life events. These can include social isolation, work stress, domestic issues, education, and other physical or emotional problems, some caused or exacerbated by social or societal pressures including those experienced online."

        {
            "text": "The global pandemic undoubtedly fuelled people\u2019s anxieties and fears and many endured long periods of isolation, cut off from friends and family. Combined with a rise in the cost of living and the impact of global crises (some closer than others), this has resulted in an increase in mental health problems and additional pressure on the health and social care system. People do not always receive a timely response to their requests for help, as they seek to live independent, healthier and happier lives."

            "text": "That said, there have been improvements elsewhere, as employers recognise the need to support their staff\u2019s wellbeing more generally. This is especially true of the health and social care workforce who need to be well supported, so they in turn can support the people and families whom we are here to serve. In the particular case of adult social work, it is essential to recognise the value of a trauma-informed approach within our workforce development arrangements and continuous professional development planning."

            "text": "Stigma and discrimination still exist, especially denying those with severe and long term mental health conditions the opportunities to work, access education and enjoy positive relationships. Mitigating or eliminating these barriers, is how we can help connect them to opportunities allowing them to live life to the full."

This includes young people coming into their adulthood, older people and people with learning disabilities and autism."

Together, we can help make stigma, prejudice and ignorance of mental health issues a thing of the past."
