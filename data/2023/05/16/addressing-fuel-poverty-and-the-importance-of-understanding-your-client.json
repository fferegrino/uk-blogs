A significant number of these social homes are below Energy Performance Certificate rating (EPC) C, meaning that upgrades\u00a0 need to be made across homes in the UK in order to reduce carbon emissions. That is why the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF) is a Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP) programme. The fund aims to improve the energy performance of social homes in England, by upgrading a significant proportion of the social housing stock with a rating of EPC C or below by 2030, while supporting the government\u2019s wider ambition to achieve its Net Zero Commitment by 2050. It will support the installation of energy performance measures in social homes in England through meeting the following objectives: delivering warm and energy efficient homes, reducing carbon emissions, tackling fuel poverty, supporting green jobs, developing the retrofit sector and improving the comfort, health and well-being of tenants."

In taking this approach, the investment will see social housing landlords safely improve the energy performance of their properties through the installation of energy efficiency measures and low carbon technologies. This will have a positive impact on tenants\u2019 lives, with benefits including the reduction of bills and improvement in their home\u2019s warmth. It will also ensure that DESNZ helps to build capability in the supply chain and social housing sector, by developing knowledge and capacity to deliver social housing retrofit in the future."

They discussed their experience of delivering the SHDF Wave 1 programme, including sharing some of their lessons learnt. This included the importance of taking the resident on the journey. SHDF projects are different to traditional asset projects in that the works are often invasive and complex. The teams spoke about the importance of involving residents in the work from the beginning and being part of the decision making process. This means that they are constantly engaged and listened to at all times - transparency is key.\u00a0"

The image below demonstrates how the exterior wall insulation appears just like brickwork. Each house received a \u201clike for like\u201d treatment - meaning if it was previously built with brick and pebble dash this would be the effect that would be used.\u00a0"

The academy will focus on building a new workforce and upskilling the current one by working with local colleges to deliver training and offer apprenticeships in retrofit and gas/electrical engineers\u200b. At the Skills Academy, we put our skills to the test and attempted to create the brick effect render used on the houses that we visited earlier that morning - as experts in project delivery rather than construction, we definitely needed longer at the Skills Academy to pass any of the assessments."

SHDF funding has provided confidence in the Coventry market for the PAS2035 (British standard that creates a recognisable quality standard for the retrofit and energy efficiency sector for housing) skill set\u200b, and Westdale\u2019s investment in continuing to build this skills supply chain is evidence of the importance of longer term investment in retrofit. The more confident the market is in this concept, the more the supply chain will respond - we can see the impact of this in Coventry as the Skills Academy seeks to boost the market locally.\u00a0"
