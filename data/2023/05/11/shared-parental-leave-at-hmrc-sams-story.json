My role is in our employment policy team working with a fantastic set of colleagues to ensure our employment framework is up to date so the department can do its vital work in administering tax, customs and financial support for the UK through our 66,000-strong workforce. I\u2019ve been doing this job since March having joined the team following a period of shared parental leave (SPL).\u00a0"

When our first child, a little boy called William,\u00a0arrived last March, we were very excited to explore how SPL could work for us. We agreed a pattern between us and with our employers: 6 months parental leave each, with my wife taking the first 6 and me the latter.\u202f\u00a0"

I\u2019ll always remember a Deputy Director in the Home Office taking SPL as particularly inspiring to me, as he did it at a time when it wasn\u2019t as common, and role modelled building a career whilst spending time with his young family\u202f\u00a0"

Firstly, colleagues were hugely excited to hear I was doing this and very positive about the experience I\u2019d have. Secondly, it was pleasantly surprising that for many colleagues this was a fairly normal occurrence and not something out of the ordinary or novel anymore. It sounds odd, but that really comforted me as it showed how much progress this policy has made since 2015.\u202f\u00a0"
