How could we encourage all DDaT staff, dispersed around the department\u2019s many UK offices, to travel to London for an away day, and how could we fit them all in one space? Despite the many challenges we faced (including a rail strike 3 weeks before the original planned event date!), DDaT Fest was a huge success.

A huge thank you to [SMT] for the Resilience session - they created such a safe environment for everyone to be open and honest and share experiences which was helpful to be able to take away and reflect on. I enjoyed the breakout sessions to understand the different roles in DDaT a lot more - the only downside is not being able to attend all of them! Thank you to everyone who made this happen, DDaT is such a special team!\u2019 \u2013 Quote from attendee\u00a0"
