For some pests it is very simple to make this judgement. For example, if a pest is only known to attack bananas, it is very unlikely to be a threat to the UK because bananas are not grown commercially in the UK. However, the situation is often not so clear cut which is especially the case when the distribution or biology of the pest under assessment has not been researched in any depth."
