You might not know that this is only possible because, during a Royal wedding or Coronation, infringement rules are relaxed so that the Royal Crest can be used on the explosion of memorabilia."

This rare\u00a0hand crafted Charles II coronation mug\u00a0looks surprisingly modern, like it could be from the latest Cath Kidston range, and shows that tastes in collectables haven\u2019t really changed all that much."
