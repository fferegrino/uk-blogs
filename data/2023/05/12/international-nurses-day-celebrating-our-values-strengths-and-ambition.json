I can honestly say it has been an incredible journey so far and it continues to be an utmost privilege to serve in public life. I have met so many incredible people, experienced so much, learnt from many situations, roles and opportunities. I am truly proud to be a nurse. We often underestimate the impact we have and the imprint we leave on the lives of others. The intimacy of the relationships we have with those in our care and their absolute trust in us feels like such a huge responsibility."

They are truly demonstrating person-centred care, discussing all the options with me and finding solutions around my hectic schedule when making appointments. The lived experience I am having is very reassuring and makes me truly glad to be part of such an incredible profession."
