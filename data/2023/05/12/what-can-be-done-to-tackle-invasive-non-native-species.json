            "text": "Non-native species (also known as alien species and non-indigenous species) are species which have arrived in a new location outside their natural range due to intentional or unintentional human actions.\u00a0 Most non-native species are harmless but around 10-15% spread and become invasive by harming wildlife and the environment. Limiting the spread of all non-native species limits the opportunities of one arriving which will establish and become an invasive non-native species."

            "text": "The routes used by non-native species to reach new locations are called pathways. These pathways can be intentional and unintentional and include: ballast water, hull fouling, contaminated equipment such as fishing kit, dive gear, kayaks and paddleboards, marine litter, escapees from sites where they are kept, releases to the wild such as unwanted pets, illegal introductions, deliberate releases to the wild by those believing it is a positive action, hitch hikers on aquaculture stock and live bait."

            "text": "Species like goldfish can find their way into the wild as live bait or dumped unwanted pets, while signal crayfish made their escape from farms in the 1980s before such threats had been realised and controls implemented.\u00a0 Meanwhile American lobsters can escape from coastal storage units, be dumped if unwanted or unsellable and even released by well-meaning individuals, following animal rights or religious beliefs, thinking their return to the wild is a positive action."

            "text": "All species have the potential to carry diseases, but some species also carry and spread diseases of international concern.\u00a0 Goldfish can spread spring viraemia of carp (SVC) and koi herpes virus (KHV) which can impact native species such as tench, while American lobsters can spread white spot syndrome virus and gaffkaemia which can be passed to our native European lobster, potentially affecting catch levels.\u00a0 The invasive signal crayfish only succumbs to crayfish plague when stressed but if they pass it on to our native white-clawed crayfish, crayfish plague will quickly devastate the population where it is introduced, which further threatens a species in decline.\u00a0 But the signal crayfish\u2019s invasive toolkit doesn\u2019t stop there, they can out-compete native species for food and habitat, further threatening native white-clawed crayfish. They can also burrow into river banks causing damage and even river bank collapse."

            "text": "Legislation has been implemented to control the use of non-native species.\u00a0 Controls on aquaculture ensure that potentially invasive species are only farmed in secure facilities such as indoor tanks and new species in the ornamental trade are limited to those least likely to establish in our waters.\u00a0 An American lobster prevention awareness campaign highlights the risk from American lobsters and encourages fishers that find them in their pots to retain and report occurrences. The Check Clean Dry campaign highlights how to minimise the risk of transferring invasive non-native species on small watercraft and fishing gear."

Don\u2019t leave litter on the beach as it can act as a raft, moving species many miles.\u00a0 Be aware that releasing an animal back to the wild because it is perceived that it shouldn\u2019t be captive or eaten is not in fact helpful, as this may cause significant problems in the wild, often many miles from its natural home.\u00a0 Rehome unwanted animals rather than \u2018setting them free\u2019.\u00a0 Get involved with local action groups who enact control plans to remove invasive non-native species such as floating pennywort from waterways. Report sightings so that authorities can investigate and act. The GB non-native species secretariat has lots of ideas of how you can help tackle this challenge on their website.\u00a0"
