How UK demand for this enhanced wireless connectivity might play out over the next decade, and what this might mean for public service delivery is uncertain. Therefore, while developing their Wireless Infrastructure Strategy, DSIT commissioned us here in the Government Office for Science\u2019s (GO-Science) Foresight team to carry out a longer-term analysis, looking at how public-service demand for wireless could change in the future."

A combination of qualitative expert analysis and \u2018light-touch\u2019 quantitative modelling (in partnership with Decision Analysis Services Ltd) showed that some public-service uses of wireless connectivity do not require the upgraded network capability that standalone 5G provides. and could run on the UK\u2019s current 4G network infrastructure. Meanwhile, other potential public-service uses, for example involving virtual reality or autonomous vehicles, could make a big contribution to demand in the future (Figure 2)."

We recently facilitated a workshop for the Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This used the Wireless 2030 scenarios in combination with the recognised futures methodology of wind-tunnelling (or policy stress testing) to help explore ways of making environmental monitoring (e.g., real-time data monitoring provided by networked sensors) more resilient to future change. We are also working with colleagues from the National Infrastructure Commission as they consider the UK\u2019s long-term strategic goals for wireless infrastructure as part of the second National Infrastructure Assessment."
