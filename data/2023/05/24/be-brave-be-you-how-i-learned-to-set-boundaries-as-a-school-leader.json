            "text": "The pandemic brought positive advances in how we do many things in schools, a few of which are still with us - like virtual parents\u2019 evenings and direct contact between parents and staff through email. Although these are great for building good working relationships between teachers and parents, frequently teachers receive requests outside of school hours. We encourage our staff to not access their emails outside of school hours or outside term time, but sometimes the boundaries can still be blurred. At our school, we sent a request out to parents that they only contact teachers during termtime, which has helped some members of staff manage an influx of requests."

I love to look and add the odd like, but these days I try to spend my free time away from social media and the pressures that come with it."

It\u2019s great fun, and hugely appreciated by our learning community, but it\u2019s a whole week of planning and delivery outside of normal school hours which is a big ask. Each year, I always feel a massive pressure to be able to switch off immediately at the end of the week. For me, being disciplined to activate the \u2018out of office\u2019 reply and give explicit directions to new parents regarding deadlines for queries has really helped.\u00a0 I know that when I mix the Welsh cake dough for team breakfast on the last day that the holiday beckons!"

I needed boundaries \u2013 and that\u2019s how I met Gemma Drinkall of HeadSphere, an educational wellbeing coach.\u00a0 Gemma and I got talking at a WomenEd Southwest event and I was keen to know more about her work. Her approach was refreshing and the coaching impactful \u2013 there is nothing to compare with the power of having your own words reflected back at you. It really makes you think."

She also helped me find the courage to do what worked for me. To read if I wanted to read, to sit in the garden if I wanted to sit in the garden. To cancel plans and be selfish, if that\u2019s what I needed at the time."
