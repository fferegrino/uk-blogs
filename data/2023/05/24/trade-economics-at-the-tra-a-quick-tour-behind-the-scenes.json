This is to test whether a proposed measure (i.e. a tariff on an imported good) is in the wider economic interest of the UK. My other responsibilities include ensuring effective use of data across the organisation, assisting with the procurement of new data sources and engaging with stakeholders."

Currently I am working on an economic model to estimate cost increases for a downstream industry as part of one of our anti-dumping investigations. This will help me determine whether the measure we\u2019re looking at is in the wider economic interest of the UK."

I am currently working with investigator colleagues to ensure good use of data in our investigations. We are looking at finding data from sources that we\u2019re currently not using to support our conclusions, and making more effective use of data visualisations to communicate trends and patterns."

To keep in touch with the team we have a weekly Analyst Huddle, where the whole team comes together and we update each other on our main 2-3 responsibilities for the week.

Thursdays tend to be the day where we all come together as a team in the office. The agenda for our team meetings is always varied. It can cover anything from monthly reviews of ongoing workstreams, where we discuss any project updates and emerging risks. We also make sure to grab lunch or coffee and catch-up on things happening in the world of trade and economics when we are all in the office."

My apprenticeship consists of a mixture of recorded lectures and live seminar classes where we discuss economic theories and solve problem sets."
