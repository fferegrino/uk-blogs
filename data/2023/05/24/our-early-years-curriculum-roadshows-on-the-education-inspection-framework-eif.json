            "text": "There were only 6 months of inspecting using the EIF before the pandemic. During those early months, we began a series of events for the early years sector. We sought to raise awareness of the new inspection handbook and explain how inspectors would look at the quality of education. We paused these events during the national lockdowns but, once it was possible, we refreshed and relaunched the programme. We are now focusing on the importance of communication and language. And we\u2019re also now able to draw on the first of our early years research reports."

Then providing children with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts will give them the opportunity to thrive.\u00a0These are just some of the messages we have shared through the roadshows."
