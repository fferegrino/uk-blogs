Attracting and retaining top talent can sometimes be a challenge for us, particularly in some of our \u2018hard to fill\u2019 roles."

            "text": "That\u2019s why we recently partnered with Hays to create the Defra Academy programme, which is already proving to be a real success. The programme aims to attract applications from individuals who have the attitude, the aptitude for learning, and the motivation to learn the skills required to do the roles, rather than focusing on pre-existing experiences or academic qualifications."

            "text": "The response to our initial Cloud Programme, which was looking to recruit eleven people and the Security Programme (seeking five people) was overwhelming, with over 1,300 applicants in less than two weeks. The progressive recruitment process removed barriers to entry and encouraged innovation, allowing applicants to showcase their strengths in any way they wanted, whether it was through a CV, video, website, or other medium. We prioritised the level of motivation and capacity held by our applicants instead of experience and qualifications."

            "text": "Once the candidates, or \u201ccadets\u201d as we currently call them, were assessed, selected, and onboarded, they underwent rigorous training in both the hard skills required for their roles, and the soft skills needed to thrive in the workplace. Our Cloud Academy Programme went live in February, with the Security Academy following in March."

We had a competition to decide on the name for our academy candidates; unfortunately, none of the suggestions hit the mark that we wanted. We then decided on \u2018cadets\u2019 but were given feedback that this might dissuade future candidates who are more mature from applying, so we are in need of a new name! Can you help?"
