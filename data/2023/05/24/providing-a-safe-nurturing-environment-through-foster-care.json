We understand that children who have experienced trauma or abuse may have difficulty trusting adults, so we take time to build a strong relationship with each child through listening to their needs and concerns, and helping them to feel valued and accepted as part of our family."

            "text": "At the moment, we are lucky enough to be fostering for Royal Borough of Greenwich who are very proactive in providing the necessary training, support and development opportunities to enhance our skills and knowledge to carry on doing what we love. I have had the opportunity to take part in valuable training courses on attachment, trauma and child development training, strategies for de-escalating anger and aggression in children and young people to name but a few. This covers areas of my day to day work with some of the children in my care so it\u2019s important to being able to apply theories practically."

For example, one of the young people in our care came to us with a lot of trust issues and trauma and didn\u2019t want to engage with any activity or anyone. However, he is now a changed person, engaging and hosting other young people in the constellation as a result of being in a hub home."

            "text": "The Mockingbird family model has worked very well for us and the members of our constellation because of the practical and emotional support system that is available, not only for the satellite families, but also for the hub carers and everyone within the household. As a hub carer you are never socially isolated as you have a community of other foster carers and their children around you all the time."

            "text": "Above everything else, seeing the gradual positive impact our daily work has on the young people in our care is the rewarding factor why we continue to do what we do. It will be good to see new people coming into fostering and retained as long-term foster carers. Although it can be daunting at first, it is very rewarding and I\u2019d advise new and prospective foster carers to just take the leap and register. You will not regret it."
