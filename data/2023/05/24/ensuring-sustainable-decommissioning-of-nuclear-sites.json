UK government policy stated that the objective of decommissioning is to remove the hazard a facility poses in a safe and secure manner, to minimise waste generation and to provide for effective and safe management of wastes generated."

            "text": "In the UK, waste with higher levels of radioactivity needs to be moved into secure stores where it is kept safely under supervision until a geological disposal facility is built. Most of the anticipated waste from decommissioning and clean-up of UK nuclear sites has only relatively low levels of radioactivity. Much of this waste will be made up of materials like demolition rubble, scrap metal, building foundations, drains, pipelines and soil. All this waste needs to be managed safely and disposed of somewhere suitable."
