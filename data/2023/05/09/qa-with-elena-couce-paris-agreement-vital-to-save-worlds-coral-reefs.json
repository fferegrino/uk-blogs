The study looked at the changes in habitat for over 650 different coral reef species in specific locations and regions across the world driven by climate change under a Paris Agreement or High Emissions scenario by 2080-2090 (so either about 1.9 degrees or over 4 degrees of warming).\u00a0 For each coral species, we trained a statistical model to look at how things like changes in sea temperature, salinity and ocean acidification could impact the distribution of that specific coral reef species, to understand which areas were likely to be able to support healthy coral reefs in the future.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Our study found that even if the 2-degree Paris Agreement target was met, the majority of the world\u2019s reefs would experience a significant loss of coral species, with particularly large declines across sites in the Great Barrier Reef, Coral Sea and Western Indian Ocean. We are already seeing this today, with mass coral bleaching events becoming increasingly common, but it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. We found that if the world can come together to meet the Paris Agreement targets, then regional coral reef species richness was largely maintained (up to 30% loss), whereas an 80-90% loss was projected under the High Emissions scenario.\u00a0 So even though individual reefs are still likely to lose a lot of species even under the Paris Agreement, when we look at the species present in other nearby reefs, we see that many of them are still going to be present in the future at different locations within the region.\u00a0\u00a0"

The hope, of course, is that we don\u2019t take that path\u2026"

            "text": "Coral mortality from bleaching due to warmer sea temperatures can only be predicted in the short term because it is due to extreme temperature events, and it is difficult to predict those in advance. We do know mass coral bleaching events are already happening and increasing in frequency, which does indeed paint a bleak future for corals. However, papers looking at mortality are generally not focusing on changes in biodiversity or community composition, so although both types of study highlight that the world\u2019s coral reefs will be significantly impacted by climate change, it's only when we looked at regional richness that we saw a nugget of hope in an otherwise depressing future for coral reefs, in that while individual reefs were going to lose a lot of species, many of these species were still going to persist somewhere in the larger region. This provides some hope that recovery may still be possible in the latter half of the century when conditions improve (if the Paris Agreement targets are met).\u00a0"

            "text": "The study looked at local reef richness (i.e., average coral species richness at reef locations) and regional richness (total number of species in any reef location within a region). Species richness is often used an indicator of healthy coral reef ecosystems. Locally we found that diversity is going down significantly in all reefs, with some areas affected worse than others, however at the regional level, we found that the species projected to be lost in an individual reef were different compared to those expected to be lost in other nearby reefs. So, if you put together all the different species throughout the region, the majority would still be there (under the Paris Agreement scenario). This is important because even if a reef has lost a lot of species, but those species are still present nearby, they could re-colonize the reef once conditions improve, whereas if they are completely lost from an area (we call this a \"regional\" extinction), then it would be much harder for them to come back.\u00a0"

It also helps us understand the areas where biodiversity is at greater risk and those where conditions look more favourable to future corals, which could help policymakers better manage and monitor their oceans, such as through marine protected areas or to help support reef restoration. It also could help policymakers plan targeted interventions to protect specific climate vulnerable species or to support species with greater resilience.\u00a0\u00a0"

This suggests that ocean acidification could have a critical impact on coral species richness.\u00a0\u00a0"

For example, we are looking at the impact of diversity loss on the ecosystem services that coral reefs provide. For example, if we were to lose particular types of corals from a reef, for example \u201cbranching\u201d species, then the animals that depend on those branching corals will no longer be able to live there. We are also looking at the implications for shoreline protection since coral reefs play a critical role in protecting tropical coastline from tropical storms and flooding. Another line of research is the impact of climate change on species that are particularly important for the coral trade and that are exported in large number by different countries in the world (for example, for the aquarium industry).\u00a0"
