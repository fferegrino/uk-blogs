Your school may already be a member but if not, you can find more information about the RPA on GOV.UK. Julie, alongside her colleague Joanne Rafferty, conduct on-site fire risk assessments every day in schools as part of the RPA resilience measures. In this blog post, Julie will guide you through how to check and make sure your fire doors are up to the required safety standards."

This prevents the spread of fire, smoke and toxic fumes for a defined period, allowing adequate time for occupants to escape before becoming overwhelmed. It will not fulfil this function if it is not fitted or maintained properly, propped open, or the 'hold open' devices are not working effectively."

Protected stairways are designed to provide a 'fire sterile' area to places of safety outside the building. Fire doors, as far as reasonably possible, will stop any gases, flame, or smoke from spreading to any floors other than where the initial fire outbreak has occurred. Your mandatory fire strategy CAD/plan will clarify the locations of protected stairways and your fire risk assessor should check the doors to the area are effective at each fire risk assessment review."
