            "text": "Tree seed is a key, but often overlooked part of tree production. With the government\u2019s ambitious tree planting commitments, and the introduction of legally binding targets to increase tree and woodland cover in England to 16.5% by 2050, demand for trees and therefore tree seed is more important than ever. That\u2019s why last year we launched the Seed Sourcing Grant (SSG), to enhance the quality, quantity, and diversity of tree seed sources in England."

These include Selected Stands and Tested Orchards consisting of trees that show superior characteristics such as form and size. Seed from these Stands and Orchards is ideal for tree planting where timber production is a priority. Earth Trust, Sotterley Estate, and Future Trees Trust, for example, are working together to develop new Tested Seed Orchards for Sessile and Pedunculate Oak, the first of their kind in the UK."
