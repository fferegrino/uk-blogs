This year, from Monday 20 to Friday 24 March, we counted 46 sessions run by 20 different public sector organisations. All of these sessions shared different perspectives and made new connections across the boundaries of the public sector. From various NHS organisations to local councils and central government organisations, we co-created value and grew service literacy.\u00a0\u00a0"

Lots of sessions were sold out and had over 100 attendees, while other sessions were smaller and more intimate by design. Many sessions were recorded and the video playlist for UK public servants is receiving hundreds of views. The link has been published via the #ServicesWeek channel on UK government Slack and Local gov digital Slack.\u00a0"

Digital and Technology Services is doing some fabulous work in collaboration with service areas across BCC to ensure we are designing truly great services for our users. It was incredible to see my colleagues stepping up to deliver some brilliant talks this year and share our experiences and learning with peers across government agencies.\u201d\u00a0"

I was lucky enough to take part in a great \u2018Introduction to service design\u2019 course, explored \u2018Resetting communities of practice\u2019 and ran 3 sessions of my own around topics I am passionate about. I\u2019ve since watched many of the other sessions and benefited from them too. Being part of our cross-government community is one of the most invaluable aspects of my role and is partly why I joined the Civil Service in the first place. To go from eagerly watching the Service Week recordings a few years ago to being part of it myself has been amazing. Thank you to everyone who was involved!\u201d"

The Modernising Lasting Powers of Attorney team at Justice Digital always try to contribute. This time me and my colleague Holly spoke about policy and digital working to achieve common outcomes. We had 100 attendees, it was ace to hear other people\u2019s experiences across this evolving space. There is always someone who has done or is doing the work that you are, and the serendipity of finding them, sharing experience and stopping duplication is the greatest asset of the public sector community, and something we should be proud of, and nurture.\u201d\u00a0"
