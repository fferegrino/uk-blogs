Vaccination has played a crucial role in protecting people from the mpox virus and reducing case numbers. People who are eligible but have not yet received 2 doses of the vaccine are being encouraged to come forward and book their first dose by 16 June 2023 and be booked in for their second dose by the end of July 2023."

            "text": "Before the 2022 mpox outbreak, transmission was primarily thought to occur between animals and humans (zoonotic transmission) through close contact with animals that had mpox. In the last year there\u2019s been a significant amount of research to understand transmission in this outbreak, as well as regular publications of data by the UKHSA and the WHO, which is summarised in the UKHSA\u2019s transmission review. Evidence has consistently suggested that transmission of mpox in this outbreak was mostly from close sexual contact representing a significant change in the epidemiology of mpox, with significant implications for our response and future surveillance."

Researchers estimated that more than half (53%) of transmission occurred up to four days before symptoms were developed or were recognised, with an average incubation period of between 7-8 days. This was the first study to ever show pre-symptomatic transmission of a pox virus."

An international collaboration of clinicians, led by Queen Mary University of London and the Fight Infectious Foundation/Hospital Germans Trias of Barcelona, identified a severe form of mpox in immunosuppressed people living with advanced HIV. They called for it to be added to the World Health Organisation and Center for Disease Control and Prevention list of severe infections that are considered particularly dangerous to people with advanced HIV disease."

People who are eligible but have not yet received 2 doses of the vaccine are being encouraged to come forward and book their first dose by 16 June 2023 and be booked in for their second dose by the end of July 2023."
