It\u2019s because it\u2019s so special, that it has been designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). In addition, together, the River Wye and part of the River Lugg form the \u2018River Wye Special Area of Conservation\u2019 (SAC), providing the rivers with the highest level of protection in the UK and of international importance."

            "text": "The River Wye and Lugg designated sites have a relatively complex set of aquatic plant and animal life, known as interest features. Conducting a full condition assessment of every feature of the river is a significant operation. A full two-year assessment is planned to commence in 2024, but in the interim, Natural England has conducted a small-scale assessment, looking at four specific features, to create an indicative assessment of the site as a whole."

Our recent assessment identified that the River Lugg is showing declines in salmon, water quality and white-clawed crayfish. The River Wye is showing declines in macrophytes, salmon and white-clawed crayfish. Natural England regularly reviews the water quality targets \u00a0and the data tells us that the River Wye is not showing a decline in water quality."

But it is important to provide context to this assessment.\u202f\u202fThese findings do not reflect a sudden decline in the health of the river but are the results of changing agricultural and industrial practices, climate change, urbanisation and a growing population over the last decades."

Unless there are changes to the external pressures upon it, the SSSI cannot reach a favourable condition."

Much of this activity is focused on improving water quality, especially reducing phosphates, which we know is fundamental to the health of the river."

We are working closely with Herefordshire Council and Partners (including those in Wales) to improve the operation of the NMB board and our joint projects."

This targeted approach works because our teams can identify specific areas to provide tailored advice that works for each individual landowner. Across those 269 site visits, our teams made over 2,400 recommendations to support farms in the Wye catchment. This includes encouraging take up of CS options such as buffer strips along watercourses."

Due to the success of these events, we have many more planned throughout the year. With the Wye and Usk Foundation we are hosting events on carbon, soils and how to reduce potato sector-specific inputs for potato farmers. With the Rural Hub and Farm Herefordshire we\u2019re developing a series of on-farm events to focus on positive soil management and soil assessments to help farmers meet their SFI soil standards."

Although there\u2019s a shared local focus on water quality and poultry units being the cause, the situation is more complex than this. The Wye catchment is suffering from the same pressures that we see across the country. Our focus is on restoring nature and the ecosystem across the whole catchment, together with the Environment Agency, the Nutrient Management Board and stakeholders."
