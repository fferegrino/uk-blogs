            "text": "Duckweed is a mass of small plants that group together to form larger \u201ccarpets\u201d that we see on rivers. Most varieties of duckweed you are likely to see are native to the UK and are often put into ponds in gardens. Though they can quickly get out of hand, as any gardener will know. The mass of plants can double in size every two or three days meaning it can spread quickly. In a river environment during normal conditions this is not an issue. The plants are eaten by aquatic animals, washed down through the system during heavy rain or die off during winter conditions."

        },
        {
            "text": "Duckweed is one of the aquatic plants that can cause problems on our rivers. By its nature, it will bloom and grow excessively in hot weather. Whilst we can intervene when oxygen levels in the water are impacting fish, removing the duckweed itself is not an activity the Environment Agency is funded to do. The process of removing the weed can also make the situation worse for wildlife. The removal process can disturb silt which can cause oxygen levels to plummet even further."

        {
            "text": "Maintenance, such as weed and grass cutting, is carried out where there is a risk of flooding to people, homes and businesses. We must focus our resources where they are needed most. Floating vegetation does not increase the risk of flooding, and we will only remove it on the rare occasion when it may affect a structure, like a sluice, operating. This is done by using the sluice gates to \u2018flush\u2019 weed from the river intermittently, though this decision is dependent on the conditions at the time."

This starves the organic matter in the water of oxygen, leaving it to decompose and cause spikes in ammonia in the water. If these spikes are severe, this can be life-threatening for fish living in the river."

            "text": "During normal conditions, when weed builds up we work with partners such as the Canal and Rivers Trust to flush excess vegetation through navigation locks and sluices. This is not to benefit flood risk but navigation and is carefully managed for when river flows and tidal conditions allow. However, when weed covers vast areas of the river as we saw last summer, periodic flushing has little effect."
        },
        {
            "text": "For example, the sluice gates at Grand Sluice can be raised or lowered to allow water through. The draw of the water pulls the weed under the safety booms and flushes it into the sea where it will break down in salt water."

            "text": "During periods of drought, the levels on the Witham can become very low. When this happens it\u2019s important that the gates remain lowered to retain as much water as possible. This means that the rivers can\u2019t go over the top of the gates and weed can\u2019t be flushed from the river. The only way to release water would be to lift the guillotine gate which would only increase flows at the bed level and not affect the surface weed. Lifting the gate completely out of the river cannot be done during a drought due to the impact on water levels along the system and the risk to water resource need and wildlife."

            "text": "The Canal and Rivers Trust sometimes remove vegetation from the channel for navigation purposes using a mechanical method like a weed boat. However, the removal of weed by boat must be carefully managed as weed clearance can cause dissolved oxygen levels to drop even further, thereby increasing the risk of environmental issues, especially for fish."
