            "text": "GDS played an essential role in setting direction and opening possibilities for doing government services well. Part of this was understanding the importance of - and taking steps to support - a positive workplace culture. The early pioneers recognised the importance of this by considering workplace culture and making it explicit. Since its publication, Giles Turnball's classic blog and the poster that resulted from his team's attempt 'to communicate the unofficial stuff' has been a touchstone for many of us working on public services. This was an obvious starting point when we wanted to look at our culture and refresh it for post-covid hybrid working and rapid growth."
        },
        {
            "text": "We held workshops and discussions about our culture and which aspects we wanted to protect and extend. The importance of psychological safety and the connection between well-being and performance were recurrent themes. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do, and psychological safety is at the heart of effective collaboration. The extent to which we can effectively collaborate in multidisciplinary teams sets the bar for what we can achieve."

            "text": "Our teams work in often fast-paced environments, building services for people within complex spaces in their lives. Also, we work on serious issues at MoJ, things that matter. That's why it's essential to support psychological safety. When deadlines are near, living up to your shared values is more challenging than you might hope. A big poster on the wall can help."

Therefore, reading the contract earlier in the week reassured me and prompted me to define my way of working for the couple of days when I had the issue. This enabled me to work flexibly, knowing that the team were aware and supportive of my circumstances at that point in time.\""
