These involve far more people than in the past, and use co-design approaches to make use of more people\u2019s knowledge and skills. To hear more about this, listen to our podcast about the maps collaboration."

The new prioritisation process will change that dynamic: we'll communicate what the next focus is, then ask the community to get involved. Hopefully this means that people are able to share more relevant information, and that their efforts will bear fruit sooner."
