We then seek to understand what domestic prices might be and whether exporters would need to sell at a dumped price to capture market share in the UK. And we look at whether there is a track record of dumping in this or other geographies.\u00a0None of these analyses alone is decisive but taken together they help us build a picture of whether dumping is more likely than not if measures were removed."
