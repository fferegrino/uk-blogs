I wasn\u2019t really looking for another role, but, sometimes you think what if I can do something else? I thought I would at least have a look to see what was out there. Nothing piqued my interest until I saw the Enforcement Manager role, it sounded interesting and certainly on paper I could tick all the boxes for what they were looking for. I attended the virtual open evening and that sold it to me!"

So it was gratifying in itself secure an interview. Interviews are not my natural forte, always nervous, and it was hard to tell how the interview went, I think they often can be. The panel put me through my paces, but I answered the questions, gave the required examples. I then had to wait for the panel to finish the recruitment exercise, so I put it mostly out of my mind whilst waiting for the result."

I was delighted, but then I got a bit scared; I\u2019d been working the same department 25 years, what if I couldn\u2019t do this new job? I think probably those feelings are not unusual. I then dusted myself off and looked forward to a new challenge."

In the Online and Supply Chain Enforcement Team that I\u2019m in, it really makes you think of all the unsafe products from unreliable online sources! My team work to ensure that shopping online will be as safe as shopping on the high street. It\u2019s really important that the OPSS tries to protect society in the best way we can from harmful products. Working on this team has influenced me to be more wary and unwilling to take risks about what I buy online."

Regulation is a powerful Government tool to address market failures, influence behaviour and promote positive action. Crafted and delivered well, regulation can be an enabler of growth, innovation and efficiency."

In my own area we have a monthly in person meeting between the two offices and I like that chance to mix with colleagues. Everyone attends from the apprentices to the Deputy Director, open communication and contribution of ideas are encouraged."
