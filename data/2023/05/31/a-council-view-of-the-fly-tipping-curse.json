It\u2019s time spent by Customer Support Officers that could be used in helping other customers with pressing needs."

This is still fly tipping. Leaving bags on the ground at recycling points might seem reasonable and like the right place for collection, but the problem is it encourages others to do the same, which in turns leads to other types of waste being left by the recycling banks \u2013 including chests of drawers, mattresses, clothes, general household rubbish and builders\u2019 waste. People see it as unwritten permission to leave their waste there for the council to \u2018do its job\u2019 and clear the mess."

The cost of clearing up illegally dumped waste inevitably impacts upon service delivery, too \u2013 and with local authority budget constraints already hitting services hard, this is a more significant problem than ever."
