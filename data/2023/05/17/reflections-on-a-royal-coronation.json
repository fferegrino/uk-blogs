As IfATE is the employer voice for skills, it was so nice for apprenticeships and technical education to be celebrated in this way.\u00a0 It\u2019d been a busy week in the run up, with the launch of six green apprenticeships that reflect His Majesty\u2019s longstanding commitment to ensuring natural assets endure for future generations, marked with the Coronation emblem."

I was determined not to miss anything so tried not to get distracted by various well-known people."

On each occasion, though, I was batting for IfATE, explaining what we did and why we\u2019d been invited. It was a great opportunity to talk about the great work we do and how apprenticeships and technical education have grown and evolved."

            "text": "I was sitting behind the tallest man in the Abbey, so when the King and Queen came in and we all had to stand I didn\u2019t get a good view. When the service itself began, screens in the nave gave us all a great close up of the ceremony itself. Being in the Abbey and hearing the service and the beautiful music first-hand really was an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Being able to represent IfATE and the work we do was a really proud moment."
