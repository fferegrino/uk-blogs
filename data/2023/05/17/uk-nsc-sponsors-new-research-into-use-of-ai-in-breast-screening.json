            "text": "If AI misses more cancers than current practice, then more women will go on to have more advanced cancer, which is harder to treat. If it provides fewer normal results, then more women will undergo the triple assessment (mammograms, ultrasounds and biopsy) and spend more time being anxious. The workforce required to carry out triple assessments is much greater than that for reading X-rays, so this is also an important consideration for efficiency and safety."
