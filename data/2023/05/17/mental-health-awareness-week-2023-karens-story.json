One part is making me worry about things and exaggerate them, while the other part is telling me it\u2019s not worth doing anything about it because it won\u2019t make any difference. It\u2019s like caring too much about things while simultaneously not caring at all about them. It can make it feel like there\u2019s a tug-of-war going on in my head, with my emotions being the rope that\u2019s being pulled in both directions. To say it can be exhausting is an understatement."

            "text": "I\u2019ve had counselling through HMRC\u2019s external employee assistance provider a couple of times. It\u2019s only been six sessions each time, but it\u2019s amazing how much it helped. The first couple of sessions were emotionally draining because I was having to talk about things I really didn\u2019t want to. But after that, things got better, and I saw the value. The counselling helped me to recognise that my issues were not my fault. They\u2019re due to mental illnesses, which is every bit as real and can be just as debilitating as physical health problems. They also helped me to identify and set in place coping strategies for my dark days."

I post on a regular basis and have found that a lot of people join in the conversations. I like to think that by doing this, I\u2019m helping to raise awareness, get people talking about mental health and helping everyone to see that they\u2019re not alone."
