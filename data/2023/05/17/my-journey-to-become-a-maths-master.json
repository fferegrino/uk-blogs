            "text": "When I entered the teaching profession it was common practice to teach maths in primary schools to children sorted into sets by their prior attainment, working toward targets that were often below those set for others their age.\u00a0 Children often remained in the same set throughout primary and moved to secondary with firmly established views of themselves as mathematicians, or not, as often the case. Never having labelled a child as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018naughty\u2019, I felt uncomfortable using the label \u2018less able\u2019 despite it being the norm at that time."

            "text": "Learning from my work with the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM)/Maths Hubs, I have found having high expectations of all children and believing that all children can learn maths, avoids blaming a child's 'ability' and automatically giving them easier work.\u00a0 Once that shift in teacher belief has taken place, focus is then on the teaching. I spend time carefully planning how to present concepts and model procedures. I use explanations with precise vocabulary, plan key questions in advance and I always consider what could be a potential barrier and how we can overcome them."

In my lessons, I focus on ensuring all children can see the structure of maths and I think carefully about what children will notice in a lesson.\u00a0 I also check in with the children during and after lessons to check their understanding and adapt my teaching appropriately. I start with the assumption that my children can learn this, so it\u2019s up to me to teach it in a way they understand.\u00a0 I no longer do three-part lesson where I show the children a procedure and expect them to remember and reproduce it.\u00a0 I no longer automatically use three levels of different tasks. My lessons now involve constant checking, looking out for and addressing misconceptions, and deepening learning through carefully designed questions. I also use practice activities that engage the children with thinking deeply about mathematics and encourage them to not rush through things in the hope of being the first one to finish. I always say to the children I teach, \u2018maths is never finished\u2019 and we should never stop learning about it."
