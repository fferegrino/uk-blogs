For example, we\u2019re currently migrating several public-facing web services to our own cloud-hosted environment, developing a Virtual Desktop solution for specific use cases and just completed a cyber security improvements programme."

That strategy works well - our staff can work anywhere and access any service on modern devices. We\u2019re big users of Microsoft 365 as you\u2019d expect, but also Zscaler for zero trust networks, AWS and Azure for cloud and we\u2019re very keen on Github and Terraform. We manage most services internally but recognise the importance of external partners to help us build or manage environments where they can do it better, for instance using a supplier to run our service desk and internet connectivity.\u00a0"

I value a high degree of trust and autonomy to deliver what\u2019s needed. Our culture is about empowering everyone in the team to deliver great services for all whilst ensuring that we offer individuals a challenge and the opportunity to develop themselves and their skills in an environment which encourages innovation and knowledge-sharing.\u00a0"

We even have someone on a senior leadership apprenticeship with the University of Exeter.
