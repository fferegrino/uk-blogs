We\u2019ve developed a buddy group to support each other, building on the wider support we\u2019ve received from others in the MoJ user-centred design community. We\u2019ll be talking more about the buddy group in the next post in this series. This post will tell you a bit about how we each made our career changes happen and why we love what we do."

I spent my evenings learning basic html and realised I really enjoyed futzing around with layouts, colours and fonts. It became an activity I looked forward to in the evenings, so I decided to look for learning opportunities where I could expand on these skills through work and I found out about apprenticeships. At first I was nervous about applying, but MoJ apprenticeships are available to everyone, with no age or grade restrictions. I applied and was accepted onto a Software Engineering course."

It was often challenging to juggle both my off-the-job learning and my day-to-day work responsibilities, but I am very grateful as it led me to Interaction Design! About halfway through my apprenticeship, I realised that I had a much greater interest in designing user interfaces than full-stack development. With the support of another designer, I began to curate a portfolio of examples of how I\u2019d been using the principles of design in both my work as a Data Strategy Manager and during my apprenticeship. I realised I had many transferable skills that could be applied to an Interaction Designer role. When a secondment opportunity came up for a junior role, I jumped at the chance to apply and here I am now, a year later in a permanent mid-weight role."

I self-studied by finding an \u2018intro to UX design\u2019 course, watching videos on the day in life of a UX designer and looking at job specifications and skills needed as well as figuring out how to create a portfolio. It also helped speaking with experienced designers. Finding a startup helped me develop these skills. I felt extremely grateful. During lockdown I improved my UI skills by doing a daily UI challenge to better understand design patterns and components for both desktop and mobile."

It was an episode of \u2018Your Undivided Attention\u2019, a series considering how we might redesign tech to produce humane outcomes, that kick-started my design thinking. I started to see design problems everywhere, particularly at work where a single task on C-NOMIS, a legacy digital prison tool, could take upwards of 20 minutes. I made notes of the issues I spotted and made little sketches of possible solutions. It felt like having a little hobby at work - I loved it!"

Upon further research, a problem-solving, human-centred\u00a0 discipline with an element of visual design seemed like the perfect fit. There\u2019s always a problem to solve in prison, and I enjoyed trying to understand prisoners and their needs to help them through their time in prison. I also designed graphics for club nights whilst at uni for fun and extra cash. It was an uncannily good fit!"

Every Junior UX job I saw advertised required at least 1 year\u2019s experience or a formal qualification.\u00a0 I found a start-up willing to give me a short UX internship in my week off after night shifts in the prison, but it wasn\u2019t enough. It seemed the perceived relevance of my prison experience did not extend to UX recruiters. I decided I needed to quit my job and complete a course that, fingers crossed, would kick-start my design career. It all seemed quite risky, not to mention expensive."

It made perfect sense- here my prison experience could be an asset and not simply an incongruous chunk on my CV. After some email chains and video calls, it was arranged that I would join Justice Digital on secondment as an Associate Interaction Designer on the Prisoner Content Hub team whilst studying for a diploma in UX design. In the last 7 months I\u2019ve received all the support, training and encouragement I could have dreamed of from my Justice Digital colleagues and the wider design community. It\u2019s a testament to MoJ\u2019s investment in early career designers that I\u2019ve secured promotion to a permanent Junior Interaction Designer role halfway through my secondment. I can\u2019t wait to get solving new problems, and I\u2019m very pleased to be continuing my design journey here at MoJ."
