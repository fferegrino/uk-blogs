Overall bathing water quality has improved significantly over the last few decades - with a continuing upward trend - due to robust Environment Agency regulation and working with partners. In most places bathing water is now better than it has been for generations."

Instead, to help bathers understand what water quality is likely to be on a given day, we carry out daily pollution risk forecasts throughout the summer. We issue a warning and advice against bathing if we become aware of a pollution incident or if we forecast that quality is likely to be reduced because of predictable factors like rain, wind or tides. Warnings are posted on Swimfo and displayed on signs at the beach so bathers can make informed decisions before deciding whether to enter the water."

Water companies each have their own system to inform bathers when their storm overflows operate, which provides additional information on water quality for the public."
