It recognises how foster care can help children to stay in their communities, with all of the benefits that brings. It recognises that, in fostering a child, carers are enriching and aiding their community. And it recognises that everyone involved in foster care is part of that wider fostering community."

            "text": "It's a community I\u2019m proud to be a part of. When I was a director of children\u2019s services (DCS), one thing I particularly loved were our annual foster carers celebrations, where we welcomed new arrivals, marked long service or celebrated wider successes. I was \u2013 and am \u2013 in constant awe of the people I met, and continue to meet through Ofsted. Creating the nurturing environment where children can thrive is not something that is easy to weigh or measure but whatever the essential ingredient is, foster carers have it in buckets."

        {
            "text": "I remember the fostering family who maintained regular contact with a teenage boy who was in their care briefly, but who needed many months of in-patient mental health care. The support of the foster carers and his \u2018foster-siblings\u2019 was fundamental to his own belief in his long road to recovery."

            "text": "I recall sitting with proud foster parents celebrating success events at school, or hearing about their celebrating exam results, getting a new belt in karate, making successful contact with a sibling, university admission, passing their driving test or getting a Saturday job. The important events in the child\u2019s journey stay with us as well as the sad times we have to support them through."

They are often contributions that cannot be captured in a league table or performance data but we do see them in abundance. We hear of it from children, social workers, Independent Reviewing Officers and from rightly proud DCSs and their teams."

            "text": "When our inspectors come back with tales of delight, we take delight in those positive outcomes. We feel a sense of professional pride in being able to report good work \u2013 work founded on love and kindness and with enduring conspicuous care and ambition, for children who absolutely deserve the very best from us."
