We do regular surveys for staff, on the processes and systems we\u2019re using in school. It's been a massive transformational change, and something now that the team are really used to."

This has made a difference to their wellbeing \u2013 they feel heard and empowered."

We\u2019ve also got to be open to change and ideas, so that staff at all levels of the academy feel like they\u2019re contributing to wider goals."
