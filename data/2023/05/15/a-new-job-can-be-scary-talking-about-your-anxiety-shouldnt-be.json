I\u2019ve always worried this would be detrimental to my working life and while job searching, it was with trepidation that I poured over job descriptions, flagging areas that might trigger my anxiety. Pushing through this, I applied for several jobs and despite my nerves, I presented myself as a calm and confident person. All the while I worried inwardly that I might struggle to maintain this throughout my entire working life."

I felt welcomed from the moment I started and some of my anxieties were eased by just the friendly staff around me. Seeing information about mental health on my local intranet and it being included in e-learning gave me the confidence to be more open about my personal mental health struggles."

I gave a lot of thought to what causes my anxiety to flare up and what I can do to adjust my working environment to make it a better place to work. If there is too much noise around me, specifically overlapping voices, I struggle to focus and it causes me to panic. Having an irregular schedule makes it difficult to balance my work life and personal life.\u00a0 Speaking over the phone with external clients can cause me to fall into a panic attack, especially if it\u2019s unexpected.\u00a0"
