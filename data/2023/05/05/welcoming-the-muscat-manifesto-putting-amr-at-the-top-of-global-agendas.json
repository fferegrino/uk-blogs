We want to ensure the UK is in a good position to deal with the complexities of AMR using a One Health approach. One of the targets in the Muscat Manifesto is to reduce the total amount of antimicrobials in the agri-food system by 30-50% by 2030. This aspirational target will drive the global ambition and commitment towards responsible use of antimicrobials in the agri-food sector."

The use of any antibiotic as growth promoters has been banned in the UK since 2006, and it is our intention to continue to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in UK livestock while safeguarding animal health."

This 10-year global initiative aims to support countries to achieve a global reduction in antimicrobial use on farms , no matter where they are on their journey to responsible antimicrobial use in agriculture. Having achieved this on a national level the UK will continue to be a supportive global partner for other countries on their own journey to responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials in animals."

The AMR-PP and RENOFARM will be vital tools in supporting countries to work towards tackling AMR and fulfil the ambitions of the Muscat Manifesto."
