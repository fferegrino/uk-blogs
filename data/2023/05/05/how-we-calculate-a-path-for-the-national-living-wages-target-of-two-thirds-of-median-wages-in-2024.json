Since the NLW was introduced, we have aimed for a target in October of each year (e.g., two thirds of median earnings by October 2024). \u00a0October is halfway through the minimum wage year and so is the best proxy for a whole year average. Were we to aim for April instead, when the rates come in, we\u2019d likely be below target for most of the year as the NLW stayed constant but average earnings continued to rise."

However, these forecasts are only available for the growth in calendar year average pay, not the October to October growth we need. We apply these monthly by assuming growth is even across the year (accounting for compounding). However, when pay growth is forecast to change rapidly, our approach effectively lags the impact of these rapid changes on our on-course rate estimates. Given that pay growth is forecast to fall, this issue currently is pushing our on-course rate estimate upwards. If we were to apply our experimental adjustment for this issue, it would reduce our on-course rate estimate by 12 pence."

We smooth to take out volatility in the AWE. However, smoothing requires relying on a longer period of historic data. This can mean our smoothed average responds more slowly to recent changes in pay growth. Currently this issue has no effect on our headline path estimate. We will continue to monitor it between now and October when we make our recommendations."
