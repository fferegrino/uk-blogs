Teaching practice based on an up-to-date, and deep understanding of relevant evidence is a hallmark of a high-quality education system, and crucial for pupils\u2019 learning outcomes."

            "text": "As we have reported over the past couple of years, the SEND (special educational needs and/or disabilities) system was put under great strain during the pandemic. Services such as speech and language therapy were not always available, and assessments for education, health and care plans were often delayed. With approximately 1.5 million children identified as having SEND, it is perhaps unsurprising that teachers want, and are seeking, more training in teaching pupils with SEND."

            "text": "Of course, the pandemic was not the sole cause of pressure on teacher workloads. We found that many teachers want more time dedicated to professional development, but that workload pressures prevent this. Often, school leaders have the best of intentions in supporting the development of their staff, but other school responsibilities get in the way, with the result that teachers use a significant amount of their own time for professional development. We did find, however, that this is less of an issue for early career teachers (ECTs), who felt that they could prioritise development opportunities enough in their working day."

The teachers who had been on these courses thought that they were relevant and high quality. However, they did report some inconsistency in how the courses were implemented, with some content less relevant or repetitive, and some highlighted poor online provision as an issue."

This is something that we at Ofsted have focused on through the quality of education \u2013 the substance of what pupils are taught \u2013 in our education inspection framework (EIF). However, in half the schools we visited, teachers\u2019 understanding of how to plan and design a curriculum remained limited, despite training and development in this area. And, more concerningly, several teachers had done courses on how to prepare for inspection, such as practising deep dives or preparing curriculum intent statements, none of which is about the substance of education."
