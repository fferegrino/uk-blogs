In the atrium, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Technical Architects Group were having a photoshoot before a meeting. I did a double-take when I saw Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) standing there. If I didn\u2019t already know, that confirmed to me that GDS was going to be a cool place to work, and it didn't disappoint."

This also included GOV.UK Elements, which later developed into the highly successful GOV.UK Design System which was launched in 2017 leading to components with built-in accessibility through GOV.UK Frontend."

When GDS updated the radio buttons and checkboxes on GOV.UK in 2016 it took a lot of work to make these accessible, particularly with voice recognition software. For example some changes worked with an earlier version of Dragon Naturally Speaking, but not the latest one and narrowing down the reasons for that was difficult.\u00a0"

The accessibility tools lab then became the accessibility empathy lab, and we opened it up to teams across government to test their own products and services or to learn more about the accessibility barriers people face.\u00a0"

It\u2019s a challenge I look forward to.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
