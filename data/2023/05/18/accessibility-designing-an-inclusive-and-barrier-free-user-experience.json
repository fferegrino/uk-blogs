I identify and remove accessibility barriers. Much of my time is spent working with people to make sure they think about accessibility and how to do things differently. I do many everyday things, sometimes with adaptations or workarounds to not seeing well."

This is a phenomenon which is quite widespread among those with non-visible disabilities. I hope that through our work, we can reach a point where accessible design is the norm rather than being seen as something above and beyond. I want everyone to benefit from an inclusive and barrier-free user experience."

I joined Defra and the fledgling Accessibility team in January last year, since then I\u2019ve recruited Zico and Chris and hopefully built a capable and caring team. I\u2019ve always been around computers and technology so a career in that area surprised no one. What surprises me is how little attention organisations give to the people using their services. I was strongly impacted when a user said she couldn\u2019t use the cool black interface I was developing for a shiny new tool."

Since then, I\u2019ve tried my best to ensure that the user, with all their various combinations of needs, is the focus of my work as a developer, User Experience Designer, and now Accessibility Consultant. I was asked at an accessibility meeting why I work in accessibility and all I could say to explain it was \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t I care?\u201d"
