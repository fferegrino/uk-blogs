            "text": "One of the reasons I joined the Civil Service in this role was because I passionately believe that government services should be easy for everyone to use. I have been responsible for digital services in a number of organisations in the private sector and it seemed like a great opportunity to focus on accessibility in a high profile government department."

            "text": "During the pandemic, I experienced elderly family members who suddenly became reliant on a mobile or tablet to carry out tasks they were used to doing in person, such as shopping or banking. Thrown into this digital world with little experience beyond basic texting, and with a variety of eyesight and other health issues, it left them feeling stressed and isolated. Appreciating that the things I took for granted felt intimidating to them, I helped them take a few steps into this new world."

            "text": "Some things were simple and intuitive. When we achieved something \u2013 like booking a supermarket delivery slot \u2013 it was a really satisfying feeling for all. This wasn\u2019t difficult or frightening and it actually made life easier."

            "text": "With more confidence, we\u2019d attempt something else \u2013 renewing a driving licence or booking a doctor\u2019s appointment \u2013 and came crashing down to earth as we became entangled in jargon, complicated passwords and journeys that weren\u2019t built for the mobile phone we were trying to use."

When we think of digital accessibility, we may often have an idea of a person who can\u2019t see a screen or type on a keyboard but that doesn\u2019t really cover it."

This is a great step to recognise the unique mix of skills, knowledge and experience needed in this role. The role means that our accessibility professionals across government have a home and a proper professional development proposition of our own."
