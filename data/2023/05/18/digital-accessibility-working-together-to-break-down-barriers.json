Your colleagues will have developed coping strategies, possibly asking others what a PDF document said over a mug of tea or working through a document knowing it would give them a headache. CSDN engages with colleagues across the Civil Service to try and make these points. For example, the People Survey is now accessible or much smaller elements \u2013 we make no apologies for \u201csending it back\u201d if it's not accessible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
