In Defra I\u2019ve felt safe from stigma or discrimination and felt able to say when I\u2019m not feeling OK to colleagues, including senior ones, and actually been supported by many of them, which I\u2019m very grateful for."

I find it hard to put into words just how amazing that was."

I stayed in one of my favourite hostels, hiked more mountain tracks, searched for glow warms and took a helicopter up to what\u2019s left of the glaciers. An unforgettable experience for sure!"

            "text": "Due to the North Island being hit by flooding and a cyclone, I didn\u2019t see as much as I planned. Nevertheless, I had a fab time including doing the Tongariro Crossing, NZ\u2019s most popular day hike and a stunning 20km-ish hike across volcanic landscape with emerald lakes, amazing views and new friends to share the experience. I also hiked Mount Tarawera, an old volcano on land that has been returned to the local Maori tribe, so the only way to visit it is to book a guided tour with them. A hike of nature providing its best."

Great hikes, big enough hills, amazing food and lovely people. I made new friends too, not only at my hostel but also whilst waiting for my flight to Hobart. Now, Mum might have told me not to talk to strangers but it really is a great way to make friends! I visited Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, where I saw a Tasmanian Devil, super cute wombats and fed kangaroos. Would definitely recommend!"

I\u2019d wanted to travel there ever since I did a presentation on it in primary school, and I have friends to visit there as well. Singapore surprised me with how green and non-crowded it felt, not to mention how tasty and surprisingly cheap eating out was."

            "text": "Taking an extended break from work really helped reduce my stress and anxiety levels and gave me time to reflect on things, including my values and how I can look after myself better. Since returning, I have kept the hikes going, even if they are on much flatter surface and slightly shorter. I\u2019m truly grateful I was able to fulfil some of my dreams, experience new adventures, make new friends and memories, and challenge myself."
