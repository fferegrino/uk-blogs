            "text": "NNR Week will be a fitting celebration for NNRs and will showcase their importance to both nature and society. NNRs safeguard and enhance England\u2019s most important biodiversity and geodiversity and provide solutions to combat climate change through carbon sequestration. In addition, they are for people to enjoy and connect with nature."

            "text": "Therefore, these places deserve to be celebrated. NNR Week is the perfect opportunity to discover NNRs by attending one of the 90 events happening at 35 reserves across England."

        {
            "text": "The week will see Natural England come together with a wide range of NNR Managing organisations, numerous charities, and community partners to put on a multitude of different events. Some events have a focus on wellbeing such as yoga, to others with a heavier focus on nature, such as beaver and amphibian walks. Lastly, there will also be events that give you the opportunity to experience what it\u2019s like working and volunteering in England\u2019s most important places for nature."

            "text": "There are countless reasons why NNRs should be celebrated. Firstly, they are England\u2019s most important places for protecting and enhancing our wildlife. They support over 17,000 species, 1,000 of which are of \u2018principal importance\u2019 to conservation in the UK."

        {
            "text": "Furthermore, as key biodiversity hotspots, NNRs are at the heart of establishing a nature recovery network and are central in the government\u2019s ambition to achieve biodiversity net gain in 2030. NNRs are also key to tackling climate change, with those managed by Natural England removing the equivalent of over 185,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year."

        {
            "text": "Whilst NNRs help to protect vitally important parts of our natural heritage \u2013 our geology, habitats, and species- what makes them even more special is that they are for all people to discover, experience, enjoy and connect with nature. Most NNRs managed by Natural England can be visited free of charge, making them ideal places for people to unearth a new passion for looking after nature and contribute towards improving England\u2019s environment to a state where wildlife can thrive."

There is something for everyone."
