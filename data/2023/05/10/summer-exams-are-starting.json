Since September over a quarter of a million exams and formal assessments have already been taken by students working towards a range of vocational and technical qualifications. The rollout of the government\u2019s ambitious new T Level continues too, with students working towards a T Level in 7 new subjects for the first time this year.\u00a0\u00a0"

This means Ofqual expects national results this year to be similar to those in pre-pandemic years. The protection means that a typical student who would have achieved, for example, a B grade in A level geography before the pandemic will be just as likely to get a B in geography in 2023, even if their performance in the assessments is a little weaker than it would have been before the pandemic. \u00a0"
