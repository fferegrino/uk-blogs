This blog focuses on one of these research reports, Abigail McKnight at the London School of Economics. Another blog focuses on the findings from research that used company data from a UK-based services company to investigate the effects of a higher minimum wage \u2013 the voluntary Living Wage."

ASHE has few personal characteristics (just age and gender) while the Quarterly Labour Force Survey is limited in sample size."

            "text": "We know from our reporting that women, ethnic minorities, and those with disabilities have lower average rates of employment but when employed are more likely to be paid the minimum wage. That suggests that, although these groups may be most likely to gain from minimum wage increases, they may also be at greater risk of job loss as a result of those increases. McKnight (2022) analyses data from the decade prior to the pandemic (2009-2019) to explore changes in minimum wage coverage and employment rates. She also investigates the impact of the introduction of the National Living Wage (NLW) on employment retention and pay progression."

Indeed, minimum wage coverage was higher among non-disabled female employees than among disabled male employees.

Among those with disabilities, minimum wage coverage was lowest for those with hearing difficulties and highest among those who did not recognise when they were in physical danger, or who had communication or speech difficulties. Among ethnicities, Bangladeshi and Pakistani employees had the highest coverage with Indian employees having similar coverage to non-BAME employees."

Increases were greater for those with disabilities than those without. There were also increases across ethnic groups. This lack of increased coverage after 2016, despite the large increases in the NLW, is in line with our findings reported in various reports since 2017."

Employment rates among men and women with disabilities followed this pattern, with increases continuing after the introduction of the NLW. There was some evidence that the disability employment gap had fallen. BAME employment rates are lower than non-BAME ones with the employment gap larger for women than men. BAME employment rates also increased over the last decade, particularly for women (and especially for Bangladeshi and Pakistani women) leading to a narrowing of the employment gap."

That is, from one year to the next, there were significant falls in upward mobility (leaving a minimum wage job for a high-paid job) and an increase in the likelihood of remaining in a minimum wage job. This effect was stronger for men but did not appear to hold for BAME employees or those with disabilities."

Increases in the minimum wage have led to higher rates of pay but don\u2019t appear to have harmed job prospects. It reiterates the importance at looking beyond broad categories of disability and ethnicity. However, it also highlights the data limitations of attempting to do so."

This potentially enables us to identify personal characteristics of workers in the ASHE sample. We are currently exploring these data, working with the WED team, and hope to provide additional information on the impact of the minimum wage on different groups of workers in time for our 2023 Report."
