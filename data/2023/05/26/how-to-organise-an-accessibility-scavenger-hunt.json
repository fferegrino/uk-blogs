You\u2019ll need to test the websites with the assistive technology you\u2019ll be using in the session to find examples. You need difficult examples that will make everyone frustrated at how badly designed websites are, and some good examples that will show people the impact of good design. We won\u2019t name and shame the bad examples that we used, but we used GOV.UK and the BBC website as good examples."

Ask your participants to find something that\u2019s listed on the page. For example - go to the GOV.UK homepage and find out how many ministerial departments there are."

            "text": "4. If it\u2019s a big group like ours was, put people into smaller breakout rooms. Encourage everyone to have a go at the tasks, and to talk as they do them. This means people can build a team spirit of \u2018it\u2019s us against the website\u2019 and find solutions to common problems together. It\u2019s a good idea to try your bad examples first and finish with the good ones to make the most impact."

        {
            "text": "5. Collect feedback. Bring your groups back together and see how people found the tasks. What was easy? What was difficult? Was there anything they found surprising? Talk about what it felt like and check people\u2019s stress levels. Ask everyone what they\u2019d do differently in the future to add accessibility focus to their work."
