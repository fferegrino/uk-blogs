The MHRA represents the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/s) in the EWG and MHRA GCP Inspectors have been attending the EWG meetings. This was initially Gail Francis, Expert GCP Inspector, supported by myself, and after Gail left the MHRA in February 2022, I became the primary representative supported by Jason Wakelin-Smith, Expert GCP Inspector. The EWG has sought input from stakeholders during its work and has met many times since its inception. It has been valuable to have participated in extensive discussions with colleagues from around the world, writing the text and listening to the views of expert stakeholders as we went along. I believe that the ICH EWG worked well together, had good leadership and the extensive and much needed administrative support provided to the group by an FDA colleague was fantastic."

This was set out in the ICH Reflection paper on Renovation of Good Clinical Practice and the ICH E6(R3) Concept Paper and a Business Plan was developed. ICH E6(R3) has been restructured and is composed of an overarching principles section, Annex 1 (interventional clinical trials), Annex 2 (additional considerations for non-traditional interventional clinical trials), Glossary and Appendices. The overarching principles, Annex 1, Glossary and Appendices will replace the current E6(R2). The development of Annex 2 will commence once the principles, Annex 1, Glossary and Appendices complete ICH step 1 with the Annex 2 concept paper being recently published. The draft principles of GCP have been released for transparency and common understanding in April 2021 followed by a global web conference to present progress."

A presentation is available from the EWG that provides their high-level summary of key changes made to the ICH GCP guideline. This blog is not intended to include every detailed change made or cover all text retained but should give you a flavour of the amendments made by the EWG. I anticipate that there could be publications that set out to discuss the changes in full detail during the consultation period, but this blog should start your understanding of what\u2019s changed. I hope this may be helpful for those who are reviewing the ICH E6(R3) document as part of the MHRA consultation and for those who will be invited to and attending the meeting of the MHRA GCP Stakeholder Engagement Meeting (StEM), a longstanding group, which will take place on 18th July 2023 at the MHRA office in Canary Wharf, London."

There are administration changes relating to ICH membership and some text outlining the new structure of the guideline. A key change is reference to the ICH E8 (R1) general considerations for clinical studies to emphasise designing quality into a clinical trial, identifying factors that are critical to trial quality, engaging stakeholders and using a proportionate risk-based approach. A key objective to the revision was to further embed the proportionate risk-based approach into the guideline."

I believe the aim of this is to discourage the application of the guideline to other trials that do not involve medicinal products. For the UK, the MHRA would expect clinical trials of investigational medicinal products (IMP) with a MHRA Clinical Trial Authorisation that are intended for marketing authorisation submissions to comply with the entire guideline and ALL trials involving an IMP, irrespective of marketing authorisation status of the IMP, to comply with the principles in section II as a minimum legal requirement."

The principles also emphasise the importance of innovative trial designs and technologies and that this could lead to more diverse populations. There is encouragement of input from potential participants, for example to assist with feasible data collection with no undue burden on participants. The principles propose evaluating risks to identified quality factors that could impact on patient safety, rights and well-being and the reliability of the trial results and implement mitigation strategies to support the conduct of the trial efficiently, proportionately and avoiding unnecessary complexities."

Four of the current principles (2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.7) are encompassed in new principle 1. This principle also includes a new expectation for periodic review of safety information, to aim to include trial participants that are likely to use the medicinal product in future clinical practice to allow generalisation and that the delivery of medical care and medical decisions concerning participants can be undertaken by other qualified health professionals than physicians and dentists. I anticipate the latter point will be a welcome change so that trials can reflect normal clinical practice. ICH E6(R2) principle 2.9 relating to informed consent had been usefully expanded to include the legally acceptable representative, that the process reflects the situation of the trial (for example emergency research) and ensuring patients can make an informed decision by the provision of the information in a way that is concise, understandable, and using new technology when appropriate. This would facilitate innovative trial design including those trials that wish to use remote consent."

The current principle 2.8 has been expanded to include the types of expertise that is required for designing and conducting a trial. It is noted that the guidance later encourages a proportionate approach to training, with that required related to whether the activities are within the individual\u2019s normal clinical practice or a new trial-specific activity."

As a result, a whole new set of principles are set out in section 6, 7 and 9. These concern the identification of critical to qualify factors and conducting a trial of sufficient quality to enable good decision making. There is emphasis on those areas that are beyond standard medical care. There is focus that processes, data capture and management are directly related to the trial objectives, operationally feasible, avoid unnecessary complexity and are proportionate to protection of participants\u2019 safety, rights and well-being and the reliability of the trial results. I suggest that this really builds into the principles a proportionate approach and allows the streamlining of trials to fit in with existing clinical practice."

There is a new principle in ICH E6(R3) to encourage transparency by public registration of trials and publishing of trial results (9.7) which I think should be welcomed. A further new principle in section 10 of ICH E6(R3) deals with ensuring sponsors and investigators retain responsibility for activities when delegated, that such delegation should be clearly documented, and the activity overseen by the sponsor or investigator. Finally, the current principle 2.12 relating to manufacture of investigational product to GMP has been expanded to include, ensuring its quality during the trial, used in accordance with the protocol and considers randomisation and blinding and labelling in ICH E6(R3) section 11."

There is some new text that introduces proportionate approaches in relation to training of staff for delegated trial activities that go beyond their usual training and experience and that recording the delegation of individuals whose trial activities are performed in accordance with routine clinical care may not be necessary.

There is new text that addresses considerations of providing new information to participants and whether re-consent would always be necessary, as this could be dependent upon the stage of the trial. I suspect that this should help investigators because it would mean that re-consenting would not be automatically undertaken, as is often seen at present, which I suggest would reduce burden on investigators. New additions address that time for consideration of participation may be reduced where justified (e.g., emergency situations). Additional text means that investigators are asked to ensure that participants are informed how their data will be handled, including if they withdraw from the trial prematurely and that the participants should have access to the trial results and the treatment they have received if they wish to do so.

There is no longer a statement in the guideline that, \u201cin general there is a need for site monitoring\u201d, which is a significant change. The introduction emphasises that monitoring activities cannot be performed by those involved in the clinical conduct of the trial. The description of site monitoring includes amendment of activities and frequency dependent on knowledge gains, allows remote activities including, significantly, remote access to the source records and other electronic systems. I suggest that these have been introduced because of the experience with monitoring trials during the pandemic. Introductory text emphasises the need for sponsor staff to adhere to data protection and confidentiality requirements, including those of the institutions that are conducting the trial.

New sections of activities are added, these are Communication with Parties Conducting the Trial, Investigator Site Selection, Initiation, Management & Close Out, Monitoring of Investigational Product Management and Monitoring of Clinical Trial Data. Current sections on Monitoring Procedures and Monitoring Reports have been retained but have been modified. Monitoring Procedures has been updated to be more general, no longer referring just to monitors and specifically mentioning the monitoring plan and replacing SOPs with applicable monitoring procedures. Inclusion of following the monitoring plan is a useful addition because I have seen trials where a suitable risk-based monitoring plan is developed, but then not fully implemented. The section on Monitoring Report has changed significantly to become more generalised to cover both on-site and centralised monitoring.

Some additional text has been added concerning the monitoring of investigational products. These are confirming products are used within shelf life, used in accordance with randomisation, that instructions on the investigational products are also communicated to the investigator and their staff and other relevant individuals and parties. New text states that some of these considerations may not be applicable to products that are available on the market.

The focus of expedited reporting of SUSAR cases is now for the awareness of the Regulatory Authority(ies), and that reporting of such cases to IRB/IEC and investigators may be subject to different expectations; for example, based on urgency and the use of aggregate information rather than individual case reports. Additional text states that alternative arrangements for safety reporting could be implemented and agreed prospectively by Regulatory Authorities when described in the trial protocol and refers to ICH E19.
