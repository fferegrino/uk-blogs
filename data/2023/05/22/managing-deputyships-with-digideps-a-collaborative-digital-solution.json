The moment Daniel received the court authority to manage his father\u2019s affairs, he was burdened with a serious responsibility. On top of this responsibility, he now has to send an annual financial report to the OPG, breaking down and categorising every transaction on behalf of his father. "

Together with OPG, the Justice Digital team implemented a system called Digi Deps, which allows customers like Daniel to account for and keep records of payments digitally, meaning they can input information throughout the year. Daniel could now sign-in and input information every month, week, or even every day if that suited him.\u00a0"

He would often talk about the weight lifting off his shoulders as he inputted the figures into the report every week. We joked about him having to complete this all at the end of the year, but the truth is this was the reality for all of our deputies before Digi Deps."

However, there will be many Daniel's around the country now experiencing the benefits of the digital reporting service. Daniel\u2019s story is evidence of the effectiveness of Justice Digital and how a small team has impacted a large part of our society in such a positive way."
