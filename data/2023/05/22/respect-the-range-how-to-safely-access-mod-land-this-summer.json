Many of these are right on the doorstep to densely populated areas and may offer public access, in accordance with the local byelaws. This means the military and public can come into close contact daily."

Lots of children approached the soldier asking questions about the Army, and some even got to try on his ceremonial helmet. All were amazed at how heavy it was."

Signage will also indicate a range of safety information specific to different sites, as well as showing where the public rights of way are.
