Following the mitigation hierarchy, BNG can be delivered on the development site (\u2018onsite\u2019), through local compensatory habitat creation (\u2018offsite\u2019), or, as a last resort, by paying for Statutory Credits."

Since running BNG service design workshops to solve the key challenges across the whole service, we have restructured the teams to take more of a focus on the needs and journeys of different user groups. This change means we can look further across the whole journeys for different users and less at isolated tasks they will be required to complete."

            "text": "One positive policy shift for our service and the register is that we can now meet an important need for landowners. Habitat units that are not sold to a developer or allocated to a development can be included in the register. This means that Gain Sites can be registered, and units can be banked ready for allocation to a development. We are hoping this offers substantial value to landowners and habitat banks as we will allow evidence of gains and unallocated units before allocation to a development."
