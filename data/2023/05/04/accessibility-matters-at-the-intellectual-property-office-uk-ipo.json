Like other Government departments, we had a focus on moving away from inaccessible content formats. We offered alternative versions of documents and made use of our in-house user research team to test content and identify accessibility problems that we needed to fix. Once we were happy that we had met the legislation for our external customers, we began to turn our focus inward and review our internal content to ensure that was inclusive too."

The question we asked ourselves at this point was \u2018how do we go about achieving this and becoming accessible by default in all that we do?\u2019"
