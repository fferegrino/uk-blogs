We looked at our school development plan and how tutoring could help deliver our priorities of improving the quality of education and closing the attainment gap. This helped ensure more disadvantaged pupils made good progress in reading, writing and mathematics by the end of key stage 2."

        {
            "text": "When selecting the most appropriate tutors, it was important that they were well versed with the national curriculum. Our tutors needed to show that they could deploy a range of approaches to successfully support the learning for a pupil from their unique starting point. A final factor we considered was the personality of a tutor - someone who is relatable and able to motivate learners in a positive manner."

The assessment lead has regular discussions with our tutoring organisations and tutors to ensure there are no issues regarding data analysis, attendance, or technical issues. The reports are also shared with class teachers who use the key information to plan and target areas of weakness. Similarly, the academic mentor liaises with class teachers to celebrate good progress or identify any issues. Pupils\u2019 outcomes are also shared with parents through certificates and book rewards."

A termly pupil progress meeting is held with all staff to discuss the impact of tutoring on the target groups of pupils. Informally, we monitor the implementation as well as talking to pupils directly to seek their views on how tutoring is improving their learning and confidence."
