The first stage, which we completed earlier this year, involved running a survey of all local authorities and children\u2019s homes providers. We asked them what they associate with the term \u2018complex needs\u2019 and how often they have issues in finding homes for, or accepting referrals for, children with these needs. We were pleased that we had responses from 807 children\u2019s homes and 78 local authorities."

We highlighted the increase in the number of children who need specialist provision to support their complex needs. And we highlighted the difficulty that local authorities experience in trying to find suitable homes for them."

In turn, local authorities reported that some homes are not able to deliver the care outlined in their statement of purpose documents. These views highlight just how important thorough and reliable information-sharing between children\u2019s homes and local authorities is."

What we do on inspection is recognise where services are adapting and responding appropriately to children."
