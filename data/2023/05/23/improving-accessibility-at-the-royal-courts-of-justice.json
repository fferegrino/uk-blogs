It was built in the 1880s, and this sometimes makes it difficult to provide a 21st century, modern justice system in a 19th century building. This presents particular challenges for court users who have accessibility needs. Due to its listed status, there are legal restrictions as to what can be physically or visually changed,\u00a0which adds to the complexity."

Our staff play an important role in making sure our users can use our services, and sometimes we may need to provide additional support."

This means that when court users with disabilities need additional support or provisions when coming to court, the dedicated DCO can help put these support measures in place. These are also known as 'reasonable adjustments'."
