The mentor might share resources and provide contacts for the mentee, but the mentee sets the agenda and follows it through.\u00a0 The mentor does not \u201crescue\u201d the mentee."

            "text": "Learning can benefit your mental health too\nLearning supports wellbeing too; this is so true. It can make you feel alive when it fires up your thinking, as your brain makes connections, whether at work or outside. Working with others and collaborating fires up thoughts within the group. The process itself sparks new ideas that spiral as others contribute to it."

            "text": "Last week also happened to be Mental Health Awareness Week, and the theme this year is anxiety. Anxiety is a normal emotion in us all, but sometimes it can get out of control and become a mental health problem. Lots of things can lead to feelings of anxiety, relationships, starting a new job (or losing one) or other big life events."

            "text": "Anxiety can be a blocker to learning too, for example many people really feel the pressure when it comes to exams. Anxiety can even put some off from taking up certain types of learning that might require a test or exam at the end. One study in 2018 showed that a quarter of Scottish parents believed that academic pressure was causing their children to feel stressed (Source: Mental Health Foundation)."

There are so many experienced Digital, Data and Technology Profession (DDaT), project, security, and other skilled practitioners in our organisation who share, support and mentor their colleagues, and in so doing deepen their own knowledge through questions that they are asked."
