For the first time, we offered delegates the opportunity to either watch the event online from the comfort of their homes or to join us in person in West London. The GDP team presented on 21 February opening with an enthusiastic \u201cGood morning, Hammersmith!\u201d. The event included a variety of topics with a special emphasis on updates on our regulatory position and the MHRA\u2019s role as a sovereign regulator. The theme of the day was largely influenced by the changes following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU."

            "text": "Tanya Giles, GDP Inspector and Head of GDP Team 1, gave an update on the changes within the team. Tanya also presented the new inspection strategy in GDP, which now features licence inspections covering all sites on a licence as opposed to previous our previous inspection strategy which was primarily site-specific. With this holistic approach the intention for inspection periods is to be around 3 to 4 years. Where a licence inspection has been conducted, this will be reflected in the text of the corresponding GDP certificate, which will state compliance with GDP across all sites approved on the licence. Tanya also reminded delegates that short-notice and unannounced inspections remain part of our risk-based approach.\nPeter Brown, Expert GDP Inspector, and Cheryl Blake, Lead Senior GDP Inspector, jointly presented the MHRA Regulatory positioning since the last GMDP symposium in 2020. Peter talked about changes following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. He focused on the changes to supply chains of medicines to Northern Ireland. Peter also discussed the current positioning regarding the Falsified Medicines Directive. He further focused on the MHRA\u2019s international partnering. Cheryl then discussed border formalities pertaining to goods flowing through the UK and Crown Dependencies. Cheryl also provided further insight on expectations for exporting medicines and compliance with the export ban list. Cheryl updated delegates on the extension of the validity of GDP Certificates until the end of 2023. Cheryl introduced the \u2018Single Trade Window\u2019 project, which is still in its early stages and involves collaboration between different Government departments. Delegates also were provided an update on the Covid Flexibilities, which were introduced in March 2020. Lastly, Cheryl presented the concept of the Compliance Monitor which is currently being piloted across GMDP cases at Inspection Action Group."

Cheryl shared the deficiency data covering October 2021 until November 2022. She discussed the main areas of non-compliance based on the 1189 deficiencies, which were recorded over 473 inspections conducted in that period. Cheryl presented the top 5 deficiencies; she also explored the underlying contributing factors for IAG and CMT referrals. Cheryl also contrasted the most recent data with historical data from 2001-2005.\nChris Watson, GDP Inspector, delivered a session dedicated to environmental changes and their impact on GDP activities. Chris explored the effect of adverse weather events on the storage and distribution of medicinal products. With the weather becoming more extreme, he emphasised the need to adopt a risk-approach when dealing with extremes of temperatures.\nJohn McNulty, GDP Inspector and Head of GDP Team 2, provided insights to the role of Responsible Person (Import)- RPi, which was introduced following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. John reminded delegates that the transition period to name an RPi on existing licences, where licensed products were imported from countries on a list, had passed and companies who had failed to name an RPi on their licence would not be allowed to import from countries on a list. John also explained the scope of each category pertaining to importation from countries on a list and its interpretation."
