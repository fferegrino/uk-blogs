I found the advert for this Academy opportunity, and it felt like what I needed to be doing, it felt more \u201cright\u201d than anything I\u2019d ever considered before. I knew I needed to give it my best shot and after a few months (and a fair bit of interviewing\u2026) I discovered, alongside 11 other applicants, that I\u2019d got the job!"

I\u2019ve challenged myself to be pushed out of my comfort zone by taking opportunities that I would otherwise have found to be scarier. I can normally feel overwhelmed or a little shaky over prospects like this. But now, with the support of colleagues, I feel as though I can be myself while engaging with the subject at hand."
