Stressing the public interest in nature and the environment and\u00a0 government commitments through the Environmental Improvement Plan and targets under the Environment Act he also said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just had Wild Isles and David Attenborough showing the beauty of Britain. We all know we\u2019ve got massive environmental challenges, terrifying figures about the state of our wildlife. And in January we had a new environmental improvement plan that said we\u2019re going to halt and reverse the loss of nature\u201d."

Responding to these claims he said: \u201cIt\u2019s ambitious policy, but when it meets ground level, there\u2019s a chorus of opposition and this [the HBF intervention] is one example of it. The environmental regulations are there for a reason. We need to take steps to manage the impacts of different sectors \u2014 housing, agriculture, infrastructure \u2014 and if we weaken those rules, we\u2019re going to weaken the chances of meeting our outcomes.\u201d"

Of course, the answer is we have to do something about all of them if we\u2019re going to meet our targets, and so it goes with river pollution."

In the northeast of England, in the south of England, in the Somerset Levels, we have established compensatory mechanisms that are now permitting houses to be built.\u201d"
