Having now been in the team for over a year, I\u2019ve learnt all about them and how they help schools purchase goods and services. I\u2019ve attended informative webinars run by the team and heard from school business managers who\u2019ve used DfE approved frameworks. I can safely say they\u2019re not as complicated as they first seemed, and plenty of help is at hand if you need it. I\u2019ve written this blog to share what I have learned, and to hopefully help others better understand what DfE approved frameworks are, how they work, and the benefits of using them.\u00a0\u00a0"

Depending on your requirements, a complex procurement process can still take many months. So, whilst it does ensure the process is compliant and provides value, it is not something that can be done in a matter of days or weeks - planning ahead is vital.\u00a0\u00a0"

They have been quality checked, meet all procurement compliance requirements, and have draft specifications and help available. They also deliver the advantages of aggregation, which combines similar needs of customers from across the public sector to increase buying power to achieve greater savings than buying alone.
