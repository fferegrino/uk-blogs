This was covered in outlets including Farming Today, Farmers Guide, Morning Star, Farmers Weekly and AgriLand, with The National Farmers Union (NFU), Tenant Farmers Association (TFA) and Baroness Rock also responding to the government\u2019s announcement."

            "text": "The measures agree with the review\u2019s key recommendations and include a new Farm Tenancy Forum which will work to consider the unique challenges facing the sector, facilitate more collaborative relationships between landlords and tenants, and help to shape farming policy. This will be co-chaired by Julian Sayers and will provide regular feedback to government, strengthening Defra\u2019s relationship with the sector."

            "text": "Today\u2019s announcement comes alongside the government\u2019s ongoing support for tenant farmers and the agricultural sector. This includes more than \u00a3168 million in grants being made available to farmers this year to drive innovation, support food production, improve animal health and welfare and protect the environment, as well as accelerating the roll out of the Sustainable Farming Incentive. More recently, the second round of Landscape Recovery was launched last week to support up to 25 more projects to protect and restore thousands of acres of the English landscape."
