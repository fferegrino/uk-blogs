If higher quality data means our judgement can be more accurate, then it\u2019s clearly in our best interests to do all we can to facilitate high calibre information sharing."

I\u2019ve identified the departmental staff who complete commissions as being key users and am following user-centred design principles to improve their experience of being asked to share data."

I\u2019ve started to implement these changes and our most recent commission brought fewer challenges and faster returns - some were even submitted early. They also provided us with 10% more data than previously, and a better picture of the data landscape in departments, for example knowing why there are gaps in certain areas provides valuable context."

Everyone I\u2019ve spoken to has been incredibly constructive in their feedback on how we build a better data commission template. With their continued help I\u2019m confident we can further reduce the pain of completing a data commission."
