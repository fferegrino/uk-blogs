In 1992, every local authority in Sweden was invited to take part in the site selection process and the search was eventually narrowed down to 2 communities in \u04e6sthammar and Oskarshamn."

When fully developed, some time in the 2080s, the repository will comprise around 60 km of tunnels with space\u00a0for more than 6,000 canisters of spent fuel."

Today we are taking care of Sweden\u2019s spent fuel in the short term in interim storage, but we need to take care of it long term as well, and that is why we need to build the final repository. We\u2019re just waiting for two key bits of legislative approvals before we can begin construction, which we expect to receive soon."

Working to inform the public for many years has been an interesting and challenging journey.\u00a0 Informing the public is what in the end brings trust and acceptance. SKB realised the importance of clear and transparent information in the 1980s, especially on a local level, and our communication and consultation programmes have evolved since then. We are very proud to have firm trust and support in the communities where we have our facilities, and it requires our dedication every day."

We have invited the people living in the municipalities where we are planning to build our facilities to meetings and events, we have a magazine, we host exhibitions, we arrange visits to our existing facilities, and that\u2019s just to mention a few. We also really utilise social media nowadays, something we didn\u2019t have 26 years ago."

We invited them to take the journey with us and have their say in the process. It has taken many years to build these relationships. We feel we are in a very good place now and our opinion polls show this."

It takes about 10 years to construct a final repository and there are hundreds of people that will be doing construction work at the site. They are going to have to live somewhere, shop somewhere, and eat somewhere locally. It creates a lot of jobs and really supports the local economy."

            "text": "When we started in the 80s, we drilled boreholes in many places in Sweden, to get a map to see what kind of bedrock we had. We had all the permits we needed but didn\u2019t consider communicating with the public before going out with our drilling equipment, so there were some demonstrations. \u00a0We had to go back and think, how can we do things better? And that is when we started to plan our communications activity. We realised quite quickly that we needed to have local information offices, where people could come in and speak to us whenever they wanted and invite the public to our facilities."
        },
        {
            "text": "We wanted to be open and transparent. It is so important to earn the trust of the local community. You have to accept that sometimes you don\u2019t have all the answers and be honest about that. For example, we were asked at the beginning what is going to happen to house prices? What will it look like? When we didn\u2019t have the answers, we found them. We took it question by question. The public need to know this information before they can say if they want to host a GDF in their community or not. In the siting process in Sweden, the municipalities need to say yes to enable SKB to take our plans forward. Both our host municipalities have done just that."

Of course, you have to have all the permits and permissions necessary, but you also need to start early and speak to communities. My advice to you, and all the other countries that are coming to us and are in the beginning of their process, is simple \u2013 start early with the communication and, be as close as possible to the people living in the areas."
