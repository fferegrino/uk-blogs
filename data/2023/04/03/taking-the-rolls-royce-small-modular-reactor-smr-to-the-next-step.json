Now we\u2019ve moved to Step 2 our team of nuclear regulators and scientists will be scrutinising even more information from Rolls-Royce SMR Ltd, identifying issues and highlighting any concerns we have. Step 2 is when the first technical assessment takes place and we focus on what features and arrangements are in place to protect the environment. This includes looking at how the design can be optimised to reduce the amount of radioactive waste produced and how that waste is managed and disposed of. We meet regularly with the company and it\u2019s at these meetings where we talk thorough what we\u2019ve found and make sure the Rolls-Royce engineers understand our expectations."
