It now takes users less than 10 minutes to complete the offboarding process whilst creating a verifiable audit trail for the department to ensure it reduces risk."

At DBT we believe that by automating as much as we can we create more robust processes, freeing up staff time to focus on other tasks."

This gives planners real-time insight that translates into better workforce planning and budget management."

This allows for verifiable audit data to be created, whilst minimising the time and attention needed to ensure offboarding is done in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The service follows the Cabinet Office\u2019s own discovery around leaving processes across government. It does this by distributing responsibility for leaving processes across multiple actors, rather than many of the line manager\u2019s tasks and responsibilities."

Next, an alpha phase took place to ensure that the team understood the biggest problems to solve and experimented with potential solutions. The team adopted a more technical approach than others would normally take in alpha. This ensured that it was even possible to create a single unified service (requiring API integrations with those services). This was important given the departments' dependency on both Oracle (payroll) and ServiceNow (IT equipment and Active Directory management)."

By doing this, they gained insight into what issues there might be when all staff would need to move to and adopt this new service. The Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Leaving team worked closely with the DDaT Engagement and Strategic Adoption team who specialise in product adoption to deliver a communication campaign informing staff about the new service."
