            "text": "I needn\u2019t have worried. By the end of the first day, I had been warmly welcomed by analytical colleagues introducing me to the data and systems, my two line managers, whose doors were always open, and Lyn Romeo, Chief Social Worker for Adults, following a fortuitous meeting at the printers."
        },
        {
            "text": "I found there was an eagerness and openness to learn from those working in the field. Weekly presentations by external professionals were well attended, and a humble mantra of \u201cyou are the experts of your locality\u201d and \u201ctell us how we can improve your ability to deliver?\u201d was present in interactions with external agents."

            "text": "DHSC is a complex organisation, working on so many different facets of health and social care at any one time. Policy and research are constantly in flux, which can be discombobulating. My advice to anyone starting is to just ask, everyone has been in the same situation."
        },
        {
            "text": "It\u2019s also a great place to learn and develop. This role combined my great passion using analysis to discover relationships and patterns within data, with social care\u2019s ability to improve people\u2019s lives on a societal level. There was great scope for further developing my coding and analysis skills, which is where I want to be in the future."
        },
        {
            "text": "One unexpected benefit of the placement was working closely with policy colleagues as a team. Seeing how policy is carefully formed was insightful, and something most social workers would not experience every day, let alone influence."

            "text": "I would highly recommend those passionate about social work to seek these opportunities and see how the policies we work with every day come into being. DHSC isn\u2019t a magic box where data goes in and policy pops out. It is made of people who care about society but have chosen a slightly different path to making that happen."
        },
        {
            "text": "Luckily, my analytical background in physics gave me that extra element to transition into this role. However, social workers have so many transferable skills: understanding legislation and how it works in practice, communication skills, partnership working, coordination, planning, ability to stay calm under stress, crisis management, which are all valued greatly in the department."
