We knew care staff were facing unprecedented challenges and we wanted to make sure they had the basic technology infrastructure to support video consultations with health professionals and to make sure residents could stay in contact with friends and family while visiting was restricted."

            "text": "I often reflect on how much our approach was informed by what we learned from that initial iPad project, both from its successes and the mistakes we made. We know it\u2019s vital to work closely with the sector, to listen to what you want, and also to understand what barriers you might be facing, so we can adapt our approach."

In our current programme, we have a local approach to how we allocate funding and support to social care which helps us have better insights into what\u2019s going on in your area and how we can work together to implement technology."

For some people, just the mention of the word \u201cdigital\u201d can fill them with dread whereas other people can\u2019t get enough of tech and gadgets. With this in mind we have published a digital skills framework aimed at improving digital literacy across social care and health."

            "text": "In our work with care providers, we still hear stories about how those early iPads are in use in care homes and it\u2019s great to learn how their use has expanded beyond their original purpose. We\u2019ve heard many examples of staff\u00a0 using them to input electronic care plans and order medications online."

More than half of CQC registered providers in the sector are now using electronic care planning solutions, with thousands having taken up funding available to implement one of our assured digital solutions."

Simple tools like iPads or even smart speakers have a place in helping to achieve this as well as more tailored solutions such as falls prevention technology. We\u2019ll be sharing our plans for how providers can access our CareTech funding offer over the next few weeks."
