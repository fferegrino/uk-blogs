            "text": "The People at the Heart of Care white paper, published in December 2021, set out the Government\u2019s 10-year vision for adult social care. Adult social work\u2019s focus on holistic, person centred care and support is its foundation."

This is not just about funding (although that\u2019s important of course), but also practical and emphatic steps to improve quality of care for the more than 10 million people in England who receive it."

            "text": "Recruitment and retention of adult social workers, indeed of social care professionals as a whole, remains a critical issue to resolve. Ethical overseas recruitment has played an important part in mitigating the problem, especially since care colleagues, including social workers, became eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa and were added to the shortage occupation list in February 2022."

The organisation has also collaborated with the Department of Health and Social Care on a new call for evidence to determine new career paths with nationally defined roles."

When you consider the additional stresses and uncertainties of the last few years (pandemics, wars, cost of living and natural disasters), our nuanced and empathic approach is needed more than ever."
