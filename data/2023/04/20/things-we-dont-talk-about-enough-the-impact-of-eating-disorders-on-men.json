Those with eating disorders \u2013 and their carers - face deep, complex challenges of mental ill health, skewed perfectionism, and misplaced drives for control. So, we spent time each week in family therapy sessions discussing emotions too. We reflected on family relationships, explored how we help her to build back her confidence and love for herself. All while juggling the different emotional and dietary needs of her brother and learning to trust ourselves again as parents."
