            "text": "Never before has good quality science, evidence and analysis on environmental change been so important for nature, society and the economy. It informs every part of the nature recovery process \u2013 from where and how we undertake restoration, to evaluating and adapting our interventions to maximise success. It also underpins our response to climate change. Wider still, nature is entering the mainstream, with sectors such as business, banking and finance recognising the risks and dependencies they have from environmental change. The board rooms require data and analysis on nature in order to take well-informed decisions. Natural England is using the latest technology and techniques alongside tried and tested methodologies to develop and provide evidence for our staff, partners and decision makers from all walks of life to support successful nature recovery on the ground and in the board rooms."

            "text": "To provide some examples, you will see we have applied social science techniques to better understand the complexity of managing human wildlife conflict. We\u2019ve described how we\u2019re using volunteer records to develop and map botanical hotspots. In urban areas we\u2019ve combined citizen science approaches with innovative eDNA techniques in our GenePools project to understand the biodiversity value of urban ponds.\nFinally the report also includes a feature on the publication of a ground-breaking handbook on geoconservation written by Natural England geoscientists that is providing the evidence to inform and support good practice."
