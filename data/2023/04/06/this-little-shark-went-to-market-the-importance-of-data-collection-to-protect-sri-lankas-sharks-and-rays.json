            "text": "Sri Lankan waters are home to at least 105 different species of sharks and rays (known collectively as elasmobranchs). These animals provide a vital income for fishers, an important protein source for local communities, and potential opportunities for tourism, as well as supporting a healthy ocean ecosystem. Recent trends have shown fewer elasmobranchs are being landed at markets in Sri Lanka, which is a possible indicator of reduced numbers in the ocean. To support the improved management of these animals, robust scientific data on catches, fishing effort, and trade is needed."

Through the\u00a0OCPP, the UK government partners with\u00a0eligible countries to deliver positive impacts on the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on healthy marine ecosystems, focussing on sustainable seafood, marine pollution and marine biodiversity."

In Sri Lanka, 66% of shark and ray species are listed as threatened by extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and 81% of the total elasmobranch landings fall within this threatened category."

            "text": "CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), is an international agreement which ensures trade in (listed) wild animals does not threaten their survival and it includes many elasmobranch species. Many species landed in markets in Sri Lanka are listed under Appendix II of CITES which means trade is allowed but should be regulated. Regulation of this trade is based on a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) which is an assessment showing that trade is only allowed at sustainable levels. Data on what sharks and rays are being caught and landed is currently limited, but improving this will support better NDFs and potentially, enable stock assessments to inform appropriate (sustainable) catch and trade levels.\u00a0 Throughout the world there is a significant market for elasmobranch products. Sharks and rays are traded for their fins for use in traditional Asian cuisine, mobulid rays are caught for their gill plates to supply the Chinese medicine market, and other species of rays for their skin which is used for leather-like products. For this reason, elasmobranchs are often processed at landing sites and markets with fins and other body parts detached. Therefore, not only do sharks and rays need to be identified correctly, they may also need to be identified correctly from their constituent body parts at the point of trade."

Expert training on shark and ray identification techniques was delivered by Dr. Rima Jabado and Daniel Fernando with the aid of three new training guides created in collaboration with Cefas. Throughout the workshop, the trainers stressed the need for species-specific data. Currently, the Sri Lankan authorities collect a large amount of aggregated species data due to the high numbers of elasmobranch species landed at markets and the lack of experience in species identification. This makes it harder to monitor trends in and estimate the total removals from elasmobranch populations. Without data on specific species, we are not able to implement effective protection measures."

The Negombo fish market is just one landing site in over 900 across the country which can be as small as a local beach front. The vessels landing into the market made just a fraction of the >50,000 registered fishing boats of Sri Lanka, a far cry away from the ~6,000 vessels registered here in the UK."
