We want to understand how to measure improvements in digital capability but also interested in any measurements that relate to other work that might be relevant. We want to learn from your experience, practice and work to identify the best possible way of evaluating capability."

Do you have any resources or examples you can share? We are also interested to hear how you have presented your findings and used them to make changes."
