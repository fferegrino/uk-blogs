            "text": "If you\u2019ve ever thought this world behaves in unexpected ways, it gets even more so the smaller you go. As you get smaller and smaller, down to atomic or subatomic scales, tiny particles can act in ways you never observe in day-to-day life. Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, or can become connected so that even when two things are as far apart as at opposite ends of a galaxy, they can still be somehow thought of as one object."

            "text": "Whilst surprising from the perspective of our everyday experience, quantum properties hold out a transformative potential that could potentially unleash vastly more computational power than would be possible with even the fastest supercomputers available today, leading to benefits across the economy and society. For example, quantum computers could offer a variety of benefits such as new ways to optimise financial portfolios, logistics, or accelerate breakthroughs in drug discovery. Harnessing quantum properties could open whole new ways to make communications more secure. However, in time these technologies could break current standards of cryptography, requiring a major evolution in how we secure information."

The biggest challenge for quantum computing is to increase the number of quantum bits, or qubits, that store and process information in the system while keeping errors in computation at manageable levels. Progress is being made, but there are still many research and development milestones yet to be hit before quantum computers can start to outperform existing supercomputers in certain tasks, and so herald in the widely anticipated \u2018quantum-advantage\u2019 era."

            "text": "Attendees agreed that much is still uncertain, but research is making rapid progress. And even at this early stage, there is an important role that regulators can play by bringing different communities of interest together, mapping how existing regulations apply, considering what the potential regulatory implications in time might be, and being on the front foot in encouraging innovation. All of this supports broader work to see science and technology drive forward the UK. It is reflected in quantum technologies being one of the five critical technologies identified in the Government\u2019s Science and Technology Framework and the new National quantum strategy, announced only days ago, which has a vision for the UK to be a leading quantum-enabled economy by 2033."

Further developed views on these topics will be covered in an upcoming Insights Paper in early Summer."
