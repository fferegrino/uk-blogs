Many work alone as a sole exams officer; others will be members of wider data or student services. All of us, however, share similar pressures and challenges and so one thing is certain; a day in the life of an exams officer is never a dull or boring day."

On some of the busier days this summer, we will need around 120 staff to cover invigilation alone. There are thousands of Applied General learners enrolled at our largest centre and overseeing all those external assessments is a huge logistical challenge. Our exams office is also responsible for the successful delivery of A level exams to our large sixth form college and that is a mammoth task."

And just like every previous year, with a huge amount of hard work, maybe some tears and just a tiny bit of luck we\u2019ll get through it. We always do. I have a feeling that it is the overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment that will make us do it all over again next year."
