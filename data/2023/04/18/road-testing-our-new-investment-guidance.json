One of the ways in which we do that is by producing guidance that is clear, accessible, and that helps trustees make confident decisions that are right for their charity, and in line with trustees\u2019 duties."

            "text": "One of our ambitions in reframing our investment guidance was to make it shorter, and sharper. We have certainly succeeded in reducing its length \u2013 the new guidance runs to 5,600 words, more than four times shorter than our previous guidance. We hope that this alone makes the guidance easier to navigate\u2013 but we now need to test that assumption with trustees."

            "text": "We also hope that our testing process will help us to hear views on our proposal to \u2018retire\u2019, so to stop using, certain terms that were included in previous versions of our guidance, but which are out of date or create confusion. These include the terms \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018responsible\u2019 investments \u2013 during a previous consultation charities gave us feedback that these terms were not as clear and inclusive as they could be. The new draft guidance instead emphasises that trustees must ensure that, ultimately, the investment approach operates for the benefit of their charity once they have considered all relevant matters. In the context of financial investments, this may lead them to choose to exclude certain investments due to non-financial considerations, or to solely focus on financial return that maximises investment income to spend on their charity\u2019s purpose."

            "text": "Last year, the courts published a judgment on trustee investment duties (the Butler-Sloss judgment), which offered welcome clarification of how existing legal principles should be interpreted by trustees in a modern context. It confirmed that trustees have wide discretion in making investment decisions, for example, in deciding to exclude certain investments based on non-financial considerations. It also confirms trustees can equally choose to focus just on financial return \u2013 ultimately what is appropriate for charities may differ. We have ensured that our updated guidance reflects that judgment."
