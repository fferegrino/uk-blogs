            "text": "Back in November, I wrote about why we have research panels in Defra. Since writing that post both the team and the programme have changed significantly. The programme and the panel have gone from being used for six researchers to over 20 researchers. This doesn\u2019t mean the panel is now impractical, but it does mean there are extra considerations for the panel and booking participants from it."

            "text": "Of course, with this change comes a change in the processes associated with managing a panel. What once was a full-service recruitment for all user researchers has had to scale back. With that comes a \u201cluxury\u201d list of what panel management could be, and a series of tasks panel managers must do to do their job."

We were in a lucky position where we have 2,500 participants who are (mostly) keen to take part in research and signed up on a panel to do this. There are still considerations we need to take with these panellists before we get them involved in research,"
