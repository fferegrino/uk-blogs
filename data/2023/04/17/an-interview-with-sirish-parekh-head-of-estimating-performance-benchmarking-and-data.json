Project delivery has faced many challenges in the past, and will certainly face them in the future - I am looking forward to listening to the insights from the sessions and how we are addressing these challenges.\u00a0"

            "text": "I completely agree. The Birmingham Commonwealth Games were a success and it\u2019s vital to observe the benefits that these projects bring, not just how much they cost. There are many other vital projects being delivered across the UK that will boost economic recovery, such as the Department for Education School Rebuilding Programme and the Government Property Agency\u2019s Hubs that embed the TIP principles."

        },
        {
            "text": "My reasoning behind prioritising benchmarking is simply to ensure we learn from our past to better inform our future, otherwise we are likely to make the same mistakes and hinder progress. Understanding why projects succeed and fail allows us to innovate. This may seem straightforward, however capturing, rationalising, interpreting and analysing data is challenging, but necessary, if we are to develop insightful outcomes such as benchmarks. And, these insights do not stop at cost and time - other metrics such as carbon and benefits are also incredibly important. As we embark on this journey, we will explore many avenues to optimise our use of data and inject confidence in our projects, as well as advance our digital capabilities. Of course, this is all part of meeting our objective of nothing less than world-class delivery."

Invest your time in building a brighter future for the United Kingdom for now and generations to come.\u00a0"
