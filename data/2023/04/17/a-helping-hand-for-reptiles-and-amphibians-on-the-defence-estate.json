In amongst the hard standings used for storing crates of jerry cans and pipelines, emergency water supply tanks and other fuel storage infrastructure are some cracking pieces of heathland, supporting all six native reptiles in what must be one of the most undisturbed heathland sites anywhere in the UK. While the sand lizards might prefer the more industrial bare ground areas, adders like the slightly scrubbier deep heather found over much of the site."

Some of our normal practices, such as having a large bonfire to dispose of cut scrub, cannot be done at West Moors because of the fire risk so we had to stack cut material in piles and use a chipper to dispose of it instead."

Adders like a slightly scrubby habitat but like Goldilocks, it must be just right and when clearing scrub, we had to be extra careful to avoid potential hibernation sites. This is the sort of task where you must think like a reptile when thinning out the scrub, keeping an eye on the passage of the sun to get the best possible mix of sun and shade, looking for structural features in the vegetation that can help reptiles in their daily lives. As well as being hard work, it\u2019s been a good test of the knowledge and skills of the ARC volunteers."

On top of that, the benefits to both physical and mental health really speak for themselves. While a ready supply of hot drinks and doughnuts might help too, the extra calories always get worked off afterwards!"
