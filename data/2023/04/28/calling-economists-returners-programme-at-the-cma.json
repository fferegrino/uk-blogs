You will be responsible for carrying out and/or supervising economic analysis relevant to the project, including presenting results and providing economic advice to colleagues across different professions and decision makers. You will have opportunities to manage and develop others, and to contribute to the development of the CMA\u2019s economics capability. You will be working in an environment with autonomy, responsibility and direct access to key decision makers."
