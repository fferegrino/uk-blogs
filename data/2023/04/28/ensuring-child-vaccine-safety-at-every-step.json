However, while the world was focused on COVID, other viruses did not go away. This World Immunisation Week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is collaborating with global partners for \u2018The Big Catch-up\u2019 to address what they estimate to be 30 years of vaccination progress lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

And this week, UKHSA\u2019s latest update showed an equally concerning drop of 7% in uptake for adolescents receiving the vaccine protecting against tetanus, diphtheria and polio in 2021/22 compared with the previous year."
