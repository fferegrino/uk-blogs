            "text": "It is the primary international platform for the peaceful uses of space, which decides the future of global and commercial space law and guidelines.\nWhat the agency does at UNCOPUOS and how we engage there make up a large part of my work as the International Regulation Manager in the UK Space Agency Regulation team."

            "text": "Vienna is a beautiful city, with stunning gothic architecture and lovely green areas. However, a trip to UNCOPUOS means you are spending most of your time at the Vienna International Centre (known as the VIC). The VIC is the home of UNCOPUOS, as well as other UN bodies on atomic energy, human rights, drugs and crime."

It\u2019s motivating to hear about these exciting new technologies and intriguing to think about how they will be regulated."

            "text": "The UK gave a record 10 statements at this year\u2019s session with myself giving five of those (read our general statement). It can be a nerve-wracking experience, giving the UK\u2019s update to a room full of international delegates, but it\u2019s rewarding to have the privilege to do it."

That phrase \u2018the committee have decided\u2019 is key, with UNCOPUOS voting by consensus, meaning every country needs to agree to every decision made at UNCOPUOS."

This could range from a reception hosted by a country or organisation, to a regulator roundtable where regulators come together to share their approaches or an evening side event bringing experts together on a pertinent issue. This time, there were events on Dark and Quiet Skies and large constellations."

This is where countries negotiate the final report of the session, which aims to reflect what countries have expressed at the meeting and what has been agreed at the agenda items and working groups. This requires you to read through the report documents drafted by the secretariat and make sure they reflect your position and priorities."
