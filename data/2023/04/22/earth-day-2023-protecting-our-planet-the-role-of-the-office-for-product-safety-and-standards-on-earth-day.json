For example, products that contain harmful chemicals can end up in our waterways and soil, causing damage to wildlife and ecosystems.

We have worked with manufacturers to develop guidelines for sustainable design and to promote the use of recycled materials. We have also worked with retailers to encourage the take-back of old electronics for recycling, preventing them from ending up in landfill sites."
