But when changes are made following media and public outcry this runs the risk of rushed, disproportionate or partial reforms. The Committee\u2019s 2021 report was not a response to any particular scandal, but was intended as a health check on the complex web of regulatory bodies, rules and codes that have evolved over several decades. We looked at the ethical regulation of public appointments made by ministers, how conflicts are managed in business appointments when people leave public office, the Ministerial Code governing ministerial conduct, and the level of transparency around lobbying and ministers\u2019 interests."
