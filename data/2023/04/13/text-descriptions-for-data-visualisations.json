However, not being an art historian, I did not really understand their stories or what I should take away. It was not until reading the museum labels and information boards that suddenly I could understand the artists\u2019 ideas and motives. Some of the art was even thousands of years old! Without this additional information, I might have left the gallery scratching my head and not taking as much away."

The primary focus of a data visualisation should be to get the message across clearly. Including a text description can act as a \u2018museum label\u2019 to provide this information and make understanding charts easier and clearer for everyone."
