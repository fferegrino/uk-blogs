Inconsistency across different manufacturers in how they display the mileage means that it\u2019s not always easy to identify the mileage reading. Mistakes such as reading the trip meter instead of total mileage can also happen."

The aim of bringing camera technology into garages is to help reduce record keeping errors so that testers won\u2019t need to enter the registration plate manually. By starting to automate data into MTS, including downloading data from the vehicle direct to MTS, we will have less reliance on manual typing of numbers. This will make it easier for those with dyslexia and dyscalculia. For more information, Chris Price discusses the use of cameras in garages in his most recent blog post in Matters of Testing."
