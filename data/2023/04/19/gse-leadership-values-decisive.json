Firstly, being focused on your desired leadership outcome when making decisions i.e. considering how your decisions will get you closer to your goal. Secondly, understanding the time window in which your decision can have impact i.e. a perfect decision made too late for impact is not good. Thirdly, weighing up the evidence and testing your decision i.e. welcoming challenge from others to inform your decision. Fourthly, learning from your decision i.e. with hindsight not every decision will be right but learning from bad decisions will help you to progress.\u00a0\u00a0"

This advice was required on a daily basis over a long period of time, often with little notice, to inform the domestic interventions that would reduce the impact of the rapidly evolving pandemic. Remaining calm and considered under this pressure, while making rapid but informed decisions on prioritisation and direction, was essential to ensure that my teams were as well prepared as possible to give advice at any point in time without burning out.\u00a0\u00a0"

To allow us to have impact immediately, I was clear that we should develop simple analytical methodologies using the information available and build from there. I ring-fenced resources to focus on continuously improving these methodologies, to incorporate additional data, information, and analysis as it became available. I also ensured that we had the right external partnerships with government, industry, academia and internationally to ensure we were capturing diversity of thought and wider context, sharing best practice, and encouraging challenge. Through this decisive approach I was able to lead my teams to evolve mature and published methodologies, incorporating multiple data/information sources, endorsed by experts including UK Chief Medical Officers. These methodologies allowed me to provide impartial evidence-based advice to Ministers which stood up to challenge and wider political views.\u00a0\u00a0"
