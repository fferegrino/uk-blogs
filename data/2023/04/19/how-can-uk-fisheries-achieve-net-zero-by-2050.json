So, it was widely welcomed when the UK Government announced its commitment to reaching Net Zero by the year 2050. But how to get from where we are now, to where we would strive to be to achieve these ambitious targets?"

However there has been progress, with significant reductions in total emission levels by the UK fleet of about 32% over a period of 15 years. Over the same period, total fisheries landings showed some fluctuations but generally remained stable."

Achieving the aim of reducing emissions to Net Zero carbon is likely to require major changes to the way that UK fisheries operate. Important changes in technology and management practices will be needed; some of these will be achievable in the short term but others will require mid to long term solutions."

Scientists, policy makers and NGOs from around the world will come together to discuss some of the most pressing problems facing our oceans. This year, there is greater emphasis on reducing emissions and climate change mitigation as many look towards how we can achieve Net Zero by the year 2050."

The report has benefited from extensive engagement with industry where fisheries representatives shared their knowledge and provided examples of the existing initiatives and challenges in using new technologies. For example, the Thanet Fishermen's Association in Kent are operating a subsidiary fuel company, offering marine biodiesel (made from reused cooking oil) to their members, and in the southwest, a skipper has been trailing a lighter, more efficient wing trawl system (known as a \u2018Sumwing beam trawl\u2019) to help reduce fuel consumption."
