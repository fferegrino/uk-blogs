When they are little, these tend to be done at their GP surgery, but as they grow up some vaccines will be offered at school. It\u2019s important to look out for and return consent forms for vaccines that are given at school."

It\u2019s best to have vaccines on time, but you can still catch up on most vaccines if you miss them. You can see the full schedule here, and if you are concerned that your child, or any family member, has missed out on certain vaccines you can speak to your GP practice about catching up. You can also use your child\u2019s red book to look back at which vaccines they have received and if there are any gaps."
