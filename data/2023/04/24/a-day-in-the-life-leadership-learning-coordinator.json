The MPLA is the IPA\u2019s flagship programme, aimed primarily at developing the skills of senior responsible owners and directors of projects on the Government Major Project Portfolio. Our Leadership & Learning Support Team handle the day to day enquiries, however, some of the more complex enquiries had been flagged that the support team can\u2019t resolve and require my response."

            "text": "I then spent the rest of the morning attending a workshop on one of our programmes - something I really enjoy about the role is the opportunity to observe different learning interventions. The workshop was around different thinking styles of leaders. During the workshop we discussed the variation of each other\u2019s results. This ranged from whether we were more adaptive (prefer to improve on current systems, respect rules and norms and get stuck into the detail) or more innovative (like to break the mould, challenge the rules and look at the bigger picture). This was valuable learning and something that I can take back into my role."

Following this, I had a meeting with my line manager to look at the participant feedback on our programmes to check if there were any areas for improvement - we regularly look at this to ensure the programmes are providing the learning that participants need."
