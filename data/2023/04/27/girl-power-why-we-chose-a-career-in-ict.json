ICT always interested me growing up, and I also knew I was good at it. I only needed to be shown how to do something once, and I could continue to replicate it over and over."

            "text": "At school ICT was always such a broad subject. From taking a desktop apart and putting it back together without breaking it, to designing animations; there was always something different and exciting so you could never get bored. I decided that\u2019s how I wanted my career to be."

            "text": "Recently I have been working on some of the internal software that has been around for many years, some of which is no longer fit for purpose. Working with stakeholders to use modern approaches and meet the needs of the end user, speeding up the process and reducing the reliance on us as developers to complete tasks along the way."

I have a two-year-old German shepherd called Nala, who is crazy and always full of energy, so most of my evenings and weekends are spent trying to wear her out just enough that she will snuggle up on the sofa and let me watch a Disney film with no interruptions."

There are lots of ways to get into the profession, and everyone brings their own unique skillset, which is great. I think my nine-year-old self would think it was pretty cool that I've made a career from the web."
