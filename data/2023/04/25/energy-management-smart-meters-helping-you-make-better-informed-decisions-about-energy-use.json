You also probably know that they are replacing traditional analogue gas and electricity meters across Great Britain. Smart meters are one part of an essential infrastructure upgrade that will make our energy system cheaper, greener, and more efficient. Other methods include LED lighting, solar panels, low-carbon boilers etc. but we will look at them another time."

This is not an uncommon question that we and energy suppliers are frequently asked. I think one of the easiest ways to know (though it can vary),\u00a0 is to check if your meter has a digital display, that probably means it\u2019s a smart meter. If your meter has a traditional clock, then it is more likely an old analogue meter. To be absolutely sure, I recommend you contact your current electricity supplier who will be able to tell you."

Installing a smart meter, isn\u2019t going to reduce the unit cost of the electricity your school uses, but it will give you more information and control."

        {
            "text": "A smart meter will remove estimated billing, and this means only paying for the electricity actually used, which should help you to budget and make informed decisions. Once you have a smart meter installed, talk to your electricity supplier who will be able to provide instructions on how to access your data. Energy suppliers are required, under energy supply licence conditions, to ensure that consumers have timely access to their half-hourly electricity data."

            "text": "If you know how much energy you use and what influences it, you can target and prioritise the best ways to reduce consumption. Many suppliers provide a dashboard that allows you to view usage over specific periods e.g., over a term, a year etc. It will let you see peaks and troughs of usage; including how much electricity is being used when your school is empty, and this will help inform how you can become more energy efficient."
