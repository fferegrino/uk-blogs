In April 2021, as the first step to achieving this, the age of entitlement was lowered to 23. This meant that 23 and 24 year olds moving to the NLW saw a much higher increase in their minimum wage than other age groups in 2021."

            "text": "London Economics compared outcomes for 23 and 24 year olds before and after April 2021 with outcomes for 26 year olds over the same period. They picked 26 year olds because they had similar trends in key labour market outcomes (such as employment) in the years leading up to the change in age threshold. Although closer in age, 22 year olds and 25 year olds did not always follow the same patterns."
        },
        {
            "text": "The research hinges on the fact that 26 year olds experienced all the events that 23 and 24 year olds experienced around April 2021, except for the large change in their minimum wage. By comparing two groups who usually follow a similar path, and who are affected equally by events in the wider economy, the researchers can isolate the effects of a policy that changes wages more for one group than the other. In reality, of course, the groups will have differences \u2013 for example, they may be more or less likely to work in sectors affected by lockdowns during the pandemic. The researchers take this into account, and \u2018control for\u2019 the potentially different impact of region, sector and a range of personal characteristics, such as education level. Importantly, this means that when we talk about changes for 23 and 24 year olds, these are changes relative to (similar) 26 year olds."

            "text": "Most importantly, we should see hourly earnings for 23-24 year olds go up faster than for 26 year olds. We would expect the minimum wage to have a direct effect on wages. It is hard to imagine it has indirect effects on employment or hours, without first having a direct effect on wages."

For 23-24 year olds as a whole, the researchers did not find any change in either hours worked or earnings. When they looked at those employed in job roles that are usually low-paid (and so are more likely to be affected by the minimum wage), they found that 23 and 24 year olds were more likely to be working part-time \u2013 and therefore fewer hours \u2013 than before the change.

At the same time, 25-26 year olds employed in retail occupations began to work more hours than they had prior to the pandemic."

            "text": "We don\u2019t always find the earnings effect that we would expect if the minimum wage caused the change. For example, the strongest negative effect on hours worked is found for women in low-paid occupations (an 8 per cent reduction in hours worked on average), but the increase in hourly earnings for these women is not significantly different from zero. For their male counterparts, meanwhile, there is a significant increase in hourly earnings, but no significant reduction in hours worked. In other cases, reduced hours and increased earnings are found together. The fact that the relationship is not consistent makes it difficult to be sure that there is a genuine causal link between the two."

            "text": "It is possible for two groups close in age to be differently affected by events \u2013 even after applying controls. The researchers compared 23 and 24 year olds to 26 year olds because 25 year olds already had different trends in employment and hours (even after accounting for different characteristics). This shows that closeness in age does not guarantee a similar experience, even without a policy change. This could be because there are differences between the two groups that we can\u2019t measure in the available data."

This could be because employers had anticipated the change, but it could also mean that the fall was caused by other factors."

            "text": "The changes we see could reflect employers preferring to give hours to more experienced, older workers once 23-24 year olds lost the advantage of a lower minimum wage rate. However, despite the fall in their average hours, 23-24 year olds were not reporting that they wanted to work more hours: the share of workers reporting any kind of underemployment \u2013 that they wanted to work more than they currently do, assuming the same pay \u2013 was lower following the change than it had been before the pandemic."

For the employers we spoke to, worker shortages were a much more important issue than the change in age threshold. Taken together with low underemployment, this suggests that the results could be capturing changes in the choices made by 23 and 24 year olds, rather than \u2013 or as well as \u2013 the choices of employers."

Recent work by the Resolution Foundation (Murphy, 2022) notes that young workers in low-paid jobs often talk positively about working less, but that this choice is made in the face of constraints that make working full-time in low-paid sectors unfeasible, such as requirements to work on evenings or weekends. Murphy (2022) also notes that shifting from full-time to part-time work could affect young people\u2019s future career ."

The finding that 23 and 24 year olds\u2019 employment remained strong after they became entitled to the NLW reassures us that it is possible to do this without harming employment prospects for 21 and 22 year olds, and our stakeholders \u2013 both employers and workers \u2013 continue to tell us that it is the right thing to do."

The LPC has recommended a large increase in the 21-22 rate this year, to smooth the transition on to the NLW. This will leave the difference between the two rates at only 24 pence per hour."
