            "text": "Chalk streams are often referred to as the equivalent of England\u2019s rain forests or Great Barrier Reef. 85% of the world\u2019s chalk streams are found in England, mainly in the south and east of the country."

They flow through some of the most urbanised, industrialised, and intensively farmed parts of the country. Over-abstraction, pollution and habitat degradation are serious concerns for environmental groups and other stakeholders."

            "text": "The collaborative \u00a328k scheme, funded by the Environment Agency, involved narrowing the over-widened river to restore this valuable stretch of chalk stream by changing the profile of the river bed and banks."

        {
            "text": "Using a mechanical excavator, a series of pools were dug into the river bed and the excavated gravel was placed onto the sides of the watercourse to form ledges. This created a narrower, deeper, winding channel which, during summer when the water level is low, will be more likely to retain water. Deeper water in the pools will also be cooler in the warmer temperatures expected with climate change over the coming decades."

        {
            "text": "As a result of this enhancement work, fish life has now become more abundant and a more varied habitat has developed for all aquatic and riverside wildlife to thrive. The riverbanks were also fenced and trees were planted along the river and in the adjacent fields."

            "text": "Since the project was completed, fish recorded in the restored stretch include eels, bullheads and brook lamprey \u2013 all of which are rare and priority species. There have also been reports of kingfishers, otter just upstream of the site too."

            "text": "Other enhancement work included in the project was the provision of a crossing that allows cattle to reach the adjacent fields for grazing. The crossing also acts as a cattle drink at one short section of river. It is fitted with gates that prevent cattle from accessing the rest of the watercourse. This stops them grazing on the river vegetation, allowing wild plants to grow and thrive in the water and on the banks, providing ideal habitat for local wildlife."
