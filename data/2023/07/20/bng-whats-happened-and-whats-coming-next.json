Feeding into the Environmental Improvement Plan\u2019s nature recovery targets, BNG gives the development industry an opportunity to work with the planning system to make sure development improves and protects our precious biodiversity, rather than further eroding it. It also has the potential to boost green jobs, innovation in habitat mapping and make green space more accessible to the public."

More time will be given to small sites (April 2024, see definition in the consultation response) and nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs) (expected in 2025). This will allow developers, landowners and local planning authorities more time to familiarise themselves with the requirements and learn lessons from early practitioners."

We are working with DLUHC on transitional arrangements to ensure that BNG is not applied retrospectively to planning applications that have been submitted or have already been granted permission before the implementation date. For example, applications made under s73 where the earlier permission was submitted or granted before this date. We will set out more detail on these arrangements in due course."
