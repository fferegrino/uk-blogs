These controls provide the assurance that schemes meet the Government\u2019s standards and legislation, as well as the requirements for managing public money."

Then it depends, but there\u2019s usually a lot of engagement across the different parts of RPA to ensure we have the latest information on the grants we\u2019ll be offering in the near future. I work closely with a number of teams within RPA to understand how grants are administered, and then ensure the controls needed are in place."

I make sure he\u2019s presented with a balanced representative report of the scheme, including our assessment of its readiness for \u2018go-live\u2019 so he\u2019s fully informed before formally agreeing to its launch. Once approved and live, farmers can apply for the scheme, or grants, if they\u2019re eligible."

I\u2019m part of RPA\u2019s Net Zero network, and recently wrote an article for our internal website about Environmental Sustainability, where I shared my own journey, encouraged colleagues to join the network and also look at what they could do in their own communities to help the environment."

It\u2019s a lot of work, and others my age might be eyeing retirement, but I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying the experience and look forward to graduating next year and using the experience I\u2019ve gained to make a real difference in the future."

We don\u2019t drive, so use trains and buses quite a lot to get where we want to go \u2013 sometimes it might not be the easiest way but knowing that I\u2019m making less of an impact with my carbon footprint makes it all worthwhile!"

I love nothing better than spending time in nature, whether that\u2019s in my local park or further afield. I\u2019m also involved with several community groups locally that are trying to bring environmental benefits to the area. When I\u2019m at home, I spend as much time as I can researching my family history, just to get a little insight into what kind of lives my ancestors lived - I\u2019ve been doing this a long time and have found relatives all over the world."
