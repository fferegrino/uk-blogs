            "text": "This was the first year under the UK NSC\u2019s expanded remit. That meant we could consider, for the first time, targeted screening (identifying people with a higher risk of a condition beyond demographics such as age or gender) and stratified screening (tailoring testing to individual risk) in addition to whole population screening programmes."

        {
            "text": "Under this expanded remit, we recommended the introduction of the country\u2019s first national targeted screening programme, which will be for people aged 55 to 74 years who smoke, or have a history of smoking. Targeted lung cancer screening has the potential to save thousands of lives and planning is now under way to establish how it will be implemented across the UK."

            "text": "We were also delighted to be able to make a positive recommendation that the rare genetic condition tyrosinaemia type 1 (TYR1) should be added to newborn blood spot screening programmes across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Screening should increase the number of babies with TYR1 who are detected before the onset of symptoms, so they can receive timely treatment and avoid the need for liver transplantation."

        {
            "text": "Good quality, evidence-based screening saves lives and reduces illness. But screening can cause harms, including false positive and false negative results, overtreatment, treatment risks and anxiety. That is why the UK NSC continues to set its evidential bar high and why evidence remains at the heart of everything we do. We assess the evidence for screening against internationally recognised criteria and only recommend screening if high quality, peer-reviewed published evidence shows that the benefits outweigh any harms."

            "text": "We also established 2 new expert groups \u2013 the research and methodology group (RMG), which will help provide clarity on the UK NSC\u2019s research and evidence requirements, and the blood spot task group, which will help identify practical and innovative approaches to the development and evaluation of evidence, and the facilitation of research, in newborn blood spot screening."
