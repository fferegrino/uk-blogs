This list does not cover every possible action and each local area will have specific needs. It\u2019s also worth noting that these points do not replace the legislation and guidance that we\u2019ll be providing later this year. You can check this page for the latest BNG guidance, which will be added to throughout summer, alongside the Planning Advisory Service\u2019s own BNG area, which contains a handy FAQ."

Consider how green infrastructure, nature based solutions, Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS), and BNG can be linked up to deliver on local priorities, such as better places for people and nature."

Consider how to include BNG requirements in your local plan\u2013 Detailing local policy requirements for BNG in the Local Plan with supporting detail set out in supplementary planning documents can provide detail for developers and landowners needing to comply with BNG. Mandatory BNG will require 10% biodiversity gain when it comes into force."

            "text": "4. Publish local habitat creation and enhancement priorities \u2013 you should make available any relevant policies and information on local habitat creation and enhancement priorities to developers. We\u2019d suggest doing this publicly on your website. This will help landowners and planning applicants when considering providing biodiversity units for mandatory BNG."

            "text": "5. Consider being an enforcing body for on and off-site gains \u2013 Significant on-site and all off-site biodiversity gains will need to be legally secured for 30 years using planning obligations or conservation covenants. LPAs can be enforcing bodies for these agreements and can offer them as chargeable services. Land for BNG can be secured via planning obligations such as s106. Conservation covenants are voluntary, but legally binding, agreements between a landowner and a designated \u2018responsible body\u2019 such as a conservation charity, public body or for-profit body to conserve the natural or heritage features of the land. You can find further information on conservation covenants here. Prospective Responsible Bodies will need to apply to Defra to be designated: the designation process is now open,\u00a0application guidance can be found here."

            "text": "6. Assess whether you want to sell to the off-site biodiversity market and/or be a broker \u2013 the off-site biodiversity market offers an opportunity for you to gain additional income and help contribute towards Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS). As a broker, you can connect developers to off-site unit providers. You can also sell biodiversity units from your own land (or via a habitat bank in collaboration with other landowners) into the off-site market, provided you do not direct buyers towards your units in preference to other suppliers. Even if you don\u2019t want to sell BNG on your own land, you could provide guidance for landowners, to encourage habitat creation in line with LNRS\u2019. Find out more on our guidance page: Sell biodiversity units as a land manager - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)"
