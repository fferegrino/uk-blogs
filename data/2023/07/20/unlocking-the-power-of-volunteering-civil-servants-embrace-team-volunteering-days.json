Embracing their inner DIY enthusiasts, the team engaged in gardening and redecorating communal areas, aiming to create a welcoming and nurturing environment for those seeking refuge."

Upon arrival, they were greeted warmly by Graham, the BHN maintenance coordinator, and the hostel residents. Following a comprehensive briefing on safety measures and assigned tasks, the team split into three groups, each led by a designated team leader."

            "text": "The gardening team, known as \"Team Garden,\" set to work revitalising the front garden and courtyard. Despite the ominous forecast, luck was on their side as the weather remained dry. They cleared the raised beds of debris and removed accumulated waste, diligently weeding the gravel and scraping away moss from the slabs. After a productive morning in the garden, Team Garden transitioned inside to assist with painting the kitchen and dining room. Their efforts were met with the appreciation of the hostel residents who even joined in."

With two halls and multiple landing areas spanning three floors, the task was no small feat. Equipped with long arm rollers and paintbrushes, the team worked efficiently, impressively finishing their assigned areas by lunchtime. Their dedication was such that Graham had to make an unscheduled shopping trip for more paint. Despite the inevitable challenges of avoiding paint drips, the team worked together to ensure a thorough cleanup, showing their commitment to leaving the space better than they found it."

The impact of their efforts was evident not only in the physical transformation of the hostel but also in the positive change it brought to the lives of those residing there. The gratitude expressed by Graham, who lauded the remarkable difference a \"lick of paint\" made, was a testament to the effect of their actions. Inspired by the EST's efforts, BHN is now exploring the possibility of promoting more team volunteering opportunities, amplifying the potential for civil servants to make a lasting impact in their communities."
