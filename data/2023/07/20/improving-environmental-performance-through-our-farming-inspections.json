In little over two years, we have created teams of officers around the country, trained them and put in place the systems and resources they need to do their jobs. Headline figures from our year of inspections are:"

The breaches included dirty water running from the yard, silage effluent escaping, the silage container wall with no perimeter drain, and a non-compliant fuel tank."

            "text": "Our officer specified a number of improvements needed to properly divert dirty water to a slurry lagoon, contain effluent by installing a bund around the perimeter of the silage container as a further measure to minimise leakage and ensure proper separation of clean and dirty water with new drainage, to avoid pollutants leaching into the groundwater and streams. The farmer was also given advice which helped with the installation of new guttering, cross drains and clean water drains."

        {
            "text": "In all such cases, officers write a report on the inspection, documenting the actions required of the farmer. We monitor the implementation of the improvement actions, in some cases agreeing temporary measures to allow time for permanent solutions to be implemented. We continue to follow up until all actions are completed \u2013 this may be over a period of several months or longer for major changes to farm infrastructure. Where farmers do not comply within the timescales we set out, we will take enforcement action."

Catchment Sensitive Farming \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 a project run by Natural England in partnership with the Environment Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \u2014 now provides services across the country and we routinely refer farmers to them for support in making the changes they need to."

The Environment Agency\u2019s Remote Sensing team provides information to officers on the ground, using drone footage, satellite imagery and other mapping tools, so that inspectors can more effectively pinpoint and targets areas of environmental harm and possible causes, and offer solutions."

This will then be followed up by one of our officers during their next farm inspection."

Enforcement activity requires concrete evidence and a solid case to put before the courts. Wherever we have this, we will be taking action."
