In other words, configure an out of the box service rather than develop a bespoke system from scratch. This approach would give the best opportunity of a Q1 delivery, and we therefore progressed with a PowerApps development."

All \u2018of this was done with the aim of ensuring that the digital development and business activities were done in tandem and didn\u2019t go off at tangents."
