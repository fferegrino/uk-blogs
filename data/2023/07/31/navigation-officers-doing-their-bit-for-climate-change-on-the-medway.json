Sadly, there\u2019s a lot to do following ash dieback. Who would have thought a Navigation Officer also does tree surgery! But that\u2019s what I love about my job \u2013 the huge variation in my day-to-day work."

An average day usually starts about 7.30am, visiting the lock sites, clearing rubbish, mowing and doing general maintenance \u2013 including the tree surgery - meeting the public, checking boat registrations and answering queries."
