Our heads of design come from not just ministerial departments, but arms length bodies, agencies and the NHS, too. Currently this does not extend to local government design leaders, as this would be an extremely large group of people.\u00a0"

We now have a Trello board with a backlog of activities and tasks that different heads are taking responsibility for. We encourage all heads of design across government to attend this meeting held on the first Tuesday of every month, and engage with some of the shared topics that we are all focussing on (and bring your own ones too)."

            "text": "We got together to discuss a few initiatives in a lean coffee format \u2014 where people suggest topics and then vote on which they want to discuss. First up was to brainstorm all the shared initiatives we want to be working on. Now that we have grown the community of design leaders in government, the chance of duplicating our work is high so we want to avoid that where possible."

        {
            "text": "One of these areas of potential duplication is shared training, so we want to\u00a0 reduce the effort of producing courses and training across departments. Currently each department is producing its own training, for example: introduction to UCD, Figma training and so on, and we are not sharing or reusing it outside of our organisations which we want to change. We talked about how we can start to audit and log what training exists and which organisation has created it. We decided that an MVP (minimum viable product) could be to start matching learners to these organisations running the training rather than creating new training internally. The next phase would be whether we can start to centralise some of this training and how that might work."

            "text": "Another hot topic was working out what tools the heads of design can and cannot access across government. If we want to collaborate, we need to know what tools are available to all to enable us to work together. This is ongoing, but an audit has been done and we are now setting up the ways to collaborate."
