            "text": "Last year, with thanks to HMCTS colleagues, judges and justice partners, \u00a0we sat over 100,000 days in the Crown Court and in March 2023 we sat the most days in a single month (10,033) since July 2015. Our internal management information (MI) shows that productivity - sitting days per working days - increased in the second half of the last financial year, to average rates not seen since 2015/16, with November 2022 (443) the highest since November 2016. These are incredible achievements \u2013 particularly when you consider the operational volatility of the last 12 months \u2013 and I\u2019m very grateful to everyone who has contributed to it.\u00a0"

            "text": "Sitting days are one way of quantifying the level of activity carried out in the Crown Court, and they are used by the Ministry of Justice to allocate resources to HMCTS. To sit in court, HMCTS must co-ordinate the resources required \u2013 court and administrative staff, buildings, judges \u2013 and the availability of parties, their representatives, and justice partners to meet the demands of the outstanding caseload, all under the listing direction of resident judges. We have deployed all of the resources available to us, and the volume of days we sat in 2022-23 is testimony to that.\u00a0"

The impacts of a worldwide pandemic were significant and enduring for HMCTS \u2013 as they have been for everyone \u2013 both personally and professionally. Add to this the other operational issues in the criminal justice system, and it has undoubtedly been an unrelentingly difficult time for everyone working within Crown and magistrates\u2019 courts.\u00a0"

We successfully overcame some of the enormous and unexpected challenges brought by the global health crisis at a time when other comparable systems closed around the world and used our learning to overcome some of the operational challenges which have presented themselves since.\u00a0\u00a0"

That said, progress takes time, and each region faces its own unique challenges, meaning that the pace of recovery and operational performance inevitably varies. I take great heart in seeing our regions heading in the right direction.\u00a0\u00a0"

You keep striving to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 by those who find themselves involved in the criminal justice system, especially victims and witnesses, and every day I find another reason to be grateful for the efforts you are making.\u00a0"

I was delighted to recently speak at the Local Criminal Justice Board conference, for example, and touched on the important ways in which HMCTS partners with others to discuss system-wide issues, raise concerns, resolve local problems and collaborate on solutions. Operational independence must always be respected, of course, but working in silos will never be sensible or indeed have the greatest positive impact.\u00a0"

It\u2019s because it allows us to improve the experience of each and every person \u2013 each victim, witness, or defendant \u2013 who finds themselves immersed in the criminal justice system, usually at an immensely difficult time in their lives. And that really is the most important point, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0"
