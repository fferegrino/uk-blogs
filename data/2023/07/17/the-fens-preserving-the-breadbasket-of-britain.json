As the Fens and coastal lowlands are very low lying, continuous \u2018flood risk management\u2019 is required. The careful management reduces the risk to the local area, including 370,000ha of agricultural land, 400,000 people and 500km of road and rail infrastructure."

Often referred to as the \u201cbreadbasket of Britain\u201d, this industry employs 80,000 people in the agricultural food chain."

This work will look at the \u2018adaptive approach\u2019 needed to manage this catchment to balance the needs of people, the environment and agriculture for the next 100 years. An adaptive approach takes a flexible approach to investment which can adapt to changes when they occur, such as, new areas of growth or changes to climate change predictions. It will involve developing investment plans which confirm what flood and coastal risk management investment will be required over the next 20 years across the Fens."

This means that the investment plans developed through Fens 2100+ will inform future Environment Agency\u2019s capital programmes from 2027. This strategy for investment across the Fens will inform funding, future efficiencies and partnerships and support the delivery of projects that aim to reduce the risk of flooding from rivers, sea, groundwater or surface water and/or to reduce the risks from coastal erosion."
