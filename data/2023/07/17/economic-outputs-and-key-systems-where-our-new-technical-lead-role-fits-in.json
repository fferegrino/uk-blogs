Inevitably, we are building up a number of \u201cnice to have\u201d backlog items which we know the project won\u2019t have opportunity to deliver; there are ongoing discussions within ONS management as to the best way to approach these and which offer the most value, so some ongoing areas of development later into 2024 are very possible. This is a complex prioritisation exercise, and the ONS expect to make a decision by Autumn 2023."

Offering enhanced functionality, the SBR is intended to replace a legacy system called the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR); this older system will continue in dual running for a little while, for which it will continue to be managed by another team entirely. However it\u2019s likely involvement will also be required in helping ensure the new SBR is meeting user needs, using technical expertise in judging confidence levels in different areas over time, for fully transitioning from the older system."
