It\u2019s more likely the wide spread use of AI and robotics will result in more, better paid jobs in the future. Yes, I know this isn\u2019t what many people think. However it\u2019s horses manure which has convinced me AI and robotics will help the social care workforce get bigger, more skillful and better paid."

As Daniel Susskind sets out in his book,\u00a0 \u2018A World Without Work,\u2019 the biggest challenge facing cities back then was what to do with all the horse manure generated in cities that depended on a horse led transport industry and the jobs that went with it. Unless policy makers could find a way to tackle this problem, London risked being buried under nine feet of horse manure by the 1950\u2019s."

            "text": "Though horse manure was a real world problem in 1890, in 1870 the internal combustion engine was invented. By 1912, New York had more cars than horses. Which also meant many horse related jobs were no longer needed and a whole set of new roles, drawing on new and existing skills were created."

A mix of sound and vision sensitive technology could help someone find their way around their home, watch out for falls, keep an eye on the fridge and make sure they eat a reasonably varied diet. AI could make regular home calls and make sure any medications and exercise programmes are adhered to."

            "text": "This, you could argue, means we won\u2019t need social care workers in the future. If AI and robotics can do all of the above, then surely most of the workforce can head off to the NHS and the supermarkets (which is where people tell me they go)."

            "text": "AI and robotics might be able to do all of the care tasks above with ease. However, the risk is that whilst that this might lead to people being more independent, managing their care in a way that works for them - do people really want to live a life where the only contact they have with the outside world is via regular calls from their AI case worker? If the robots are having an off day - who rescues you from the one that forgets to help you get out of the bath or put on your pants?"

Which is why we need to start strategic workforce planning now and why I like to think of the future social care workforce as being filled with geeks with emotional intelligence."
