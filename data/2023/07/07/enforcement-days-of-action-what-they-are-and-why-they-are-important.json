I\u2019ve done the role for four years and I enjoy helping to ensure the environment is protected by working to combat illegal waste activities with my knowledgeable team."

We have legal powers to seize vehicles, issue notices, stop activities and prosecute people \u2013 they can then be fined or sent to prison by the courts. We always start by providing advice and guidance in the first instance, so people have the opportunity to comply."

Days of Action enable us to work safely together with a large number of officers, be visible to the public and demonstrate to our customers the role we play in protecting the environment and communities."

This partnership approach brings relationship-building opportunities, boosts Learning and Development for new or less experienced staff members and has the benefit of working with other peoples\u2019 insight and intel, as well as providing safety in numbers. We\u2019ve found these days are very successful for covering lots of sites across a large area, working safely, building the skills and knowledge of our officers, effective team-working working and sharing best practice with partners."

Situations can become challenging on Days of Action and through any aspect of our regulatory role. Officers are fully trained to deal with hostile situations and we also make it clear that we won\u2019t tolerate disrespectful behaviour. The cameras were not needed on this occasion but wearing them can prevent hostility from starting in the first place."

These events take great planning and preparation, but it\u2019s always worth it and helps us achieve positive outcomes, including identifying business that need intervention or investigation, providing advice and guidance, increasing the visibility of our pollution prevention and regulatory work, and building our relationships with legitimate businesses. Ultimately we\u2019re here to protect the environment and people which these Days of Actions help us do."
