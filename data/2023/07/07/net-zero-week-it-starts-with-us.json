Net Zero Week is a reminder of the collective responsibility we all hold in achieving our commitments to tackle the climate and nature emergency. One way government and industry can play our part is through the implementation of Transforming Infrastructure Performance (TIP): Roadmap to 2030. To emphasise our pace for change, we have a vision for the core TIP principles to be business as usual (BAU) by 2025, meaning value-led and data-driven decision making is core to all project delivery."

For me, it is that I will have done my best to make the best difference I can for the planet through the work I do. My daily reminder of the definition of 'doing my best' comes from Sir David King and the engineers at the Centre for Climate Repair in Cambridge, who are working on technologies to refreeze the Arctic. Because no matter what we achieve with our net zero goals, the Arctic has gone beyond a tipping point, where more ice now melts in the summer than can refreeze in the winter. This is terrifying news for all life forms that depend on the earth systems as we know them today, and that of course, includes us. So the efforts of Sir David King and his team, is what I believe it looks like when people choose to do their best.\u00a0"

The climate emergency is a systemic problem, so it requires a systemic solution, and I can't think of anything more systemic than project delivery. Imagine if we galvanise the global project delivery community, to make better and more sustainable choices every day when delivering projects (and I refer you to my earlier definition of 'doing our best'), to make the best differences possible for the economy, the environment and society as a whole. Then we are living by the core principles of TIP - and that's what we are driving at, with all our courage and compassion."

But perhaps it's also because we don\u2019t talk enough about the opportunities and wider benefits that change can bring.
