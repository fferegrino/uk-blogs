This was the first time that I had managed a tender of this scale since the school had become part of the academy trust and I was looking for support to help guide me through the buying process."

            "text": "I had seen options where I could pay a premium to get buying support, which I had begun to investigate. It was during this time that I saw an email advertising one-to-one calls with the Schools Commercial Team for anyone who needed help with their buying. I booked a slot and during the call I was alerted to the Get help buying for schools service. I submitted a request for advice and guidance online through GOV.UK, was almost immediately contacted by the service and the process started from there."

            "text": "Compliance was my number one reason for using the service. I was supported by a procurement expert throughout the entire process. They ensured I was doing all the right things at the right time and it was so helpful having someone to guide and prompt me, and someone to call when I didn\u2019t understand something, or needed specialist advice."
