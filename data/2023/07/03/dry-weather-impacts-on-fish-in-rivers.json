The piece highlights that the Environment Agency has received more reports of dead fish than the same time last year, and also includes a comment from the Angling Trust who say they normally expect rivers to be affected later in the summer when it's hotter and drier."

            "text": "The Environment Agency recognise the harmful and serious risks that fish face due to prolonged dry weather and continue to respond to incident reports to help mitigate the impacts of recent high temperatures. This includes deploying aeration equipment to restore dissolved oxygen levels in watercourses; providing advice to angling clubs, fisheries, and anglers; and occasionally, as a last resort, relocating fish."
