            "text": "This means that all trees bought by new applicants (from 1 July 2023) for these funds, will need to be sourced from Plant Healthy certified suppliers or be accompanied by a \u00a0Ready to Plant voucher. These standards mean that an independent assessment has taken place to make sure that the supplier has robust plant health management measures in place."

This extension to LATF and UTCF will apply the Biosecure Procurement Requirement to urban tree planting for the first time. The HS2 Woodland Fund supports the restoration of Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites and Woodland Creation (delivered via the England Woodland Creation Offer)."

            "text": "Over time, new introductions of pests and diseases which have not historically been found in the UK can threaten to overwhelm UK trees, which unlike the original host trees, may not have evolved defence mechanisms. One example of this happening is ash dieback disease, which has been predicted to result in a loss of \u00a315 billion over the next 100 years (reference:Hill et al., 2019), since it first reached the UK in 2012."

        {
            "text": "However, the threat of new pests and diseases is highest in high-traffic, urban environments and one study found that up to 89% of first detections of non-native tree pests were in cities or urban areas. These pests can hitchhike in transport and imports of wood products, or even on the trees we plant. The need to strengthen the biosecurity of these front-line urban trees in high traffic environments is therefore critical to give them the best chance to survive, protecting the public investment for all."
