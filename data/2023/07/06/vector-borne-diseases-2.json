            "text": "Arthropod-borne viruses are the cause of some of the greatest burdens to human and animal health worldwide. The effect of global climate change, wildlife migration and increased surveillance, means that there is strong evidence that temperate regions, such as the UK, are now seeing repeated introductions of invasive mosquito species, as well as mosquito-borne viruses not previously detected in the UK."

            "text": "For example, in Europe, repeated introductions of West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus have been associated with bird migration from Africa and led to the establishment of these viruses in southern and eastern Europe. Subsequent short distance spread has occurred in new areas of western Europe, and six invasive mosquito species are now well established in countries across the Mediterranean basin."

More recently, WNV was detected in great owls in northern Germany. Based on previous years, WNV is likely to establish and spread, increasing the risk of introduction to the UK through bird migration or human mediated activities."

            "text": "In 2019, tick borne encephalitis virus was detected in the UK, followed by the detection of Usutu virus in 2020. Further complicating the situation, the invasive species Aedes\u00a0albopictus (tiger mosquito) has been detected six times in southern England. As such, the UK is at risk from the introduction and establishment of exotic arboviruses, and as climate change continues, arthropods that can transmit vector-borne diseases are increasingly likely to be found in the UK."

Results show that at 21\u00b0C Culex pipiens can be infected with Japanese Encephalitis virus but infected mosquitoes did not contain live virus in saliva samples suggesting an inability to transmit infection to humans or animals. However, at 25\u00b0C this mosquito species can be infected, and live virus was detected in saliva, suggesting that bite transmission may be possible should the virus reach the UK in susceptible vector species during the warmer months of the year."

Although less virulent in humans and horses, Usutu can cause a lethal disease in certain species of birds, particularly the common (Eurasian) blackbird. Work is currently underway with ZSL to assess whether Usutu virus can overwinter (live through winter) in the UK. This is particularly relevant as we now experience warmer winter temperatures."
