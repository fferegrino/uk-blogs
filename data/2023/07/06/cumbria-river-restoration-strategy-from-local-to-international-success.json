The joint work of the Environment Agency, Natural England and partners was recognised as winners last November for efforts across Cumbria to reinstate natural river processes that benefit both people and wildlife. Olly Southgate, Environment Agency Programme Manager tells us more about the project, its successes, and how they\u2019re using the momentum to drive this work forward."

            "text": "Many of our rivers have historically been extensively modified, compromising natural habitats and the benefits that rivers naturally provide us with. Reintroducing natural processes, such as variation in flows, connection with floodplains and sediment management, can reshape rivers to provide the diverse habitats and support a healthy river ecosystem.\u00a0Delivering river restoration work can provide a wide range of benefits, creating better natural habitats for wildlife, making them more resilient to drought conditions and reducing flood risk through innovative nature-based solutions."

            "text": "The initial aim was to develop a programme of interventions that would not only protect and enhance the protected areas, but also potentially reduce flood risk, boost biodiversity, and create a more sustainable environment for all. At the start it was very much just an aspiration and concept, but it\u2019s expanded to a huge fully functioning machine, delivering vast amounts of benefits for both our communities and wildlife."

This joint effort of partners, stakeholders, local communities and private landowners was the main driving force behind the success of this programme. Enabling a positive \u2018can do\u2019 mindset from the beginning was also key. The journey can be extremely challenging at times, but less so with good people supporting you throughout."

In an ever-changing climate it\u2019s work like this that will help to improve our environment for generations to come. The programme is now in the finals of the World River Prize which is set to be awarded in Brisbane in 2024. The competition will be fierce, with some of the largest river basins in the world also in contention, but we\u2019re just really proud to even be in the mix and to be recognised as a true flagship restoration programme internationally."

The programme continues to grow and we aim to deliver even more great projects in the future. We are also always keen to share our lessons learnt, in a bid to enthuse others to replicate our successful model in other UK and European catchments and river basins. We\u2019re already doing this by visiting the Vjosa river in Albania in September, as well as hosting various workshops and events over the next year."
