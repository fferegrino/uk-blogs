Some of these include \u2018blue carbon\u2019 habitats which can help to tackle climate change by capturing and storing carbon."

            "text": "Coverage was also seen nationally on BBC Online highlighting the reasons for designating the three sites being for ecological importance of nature recovery, as well as their social and economic impacts. The piece touched on the Scottish government\u2019s recent decision to scrap plans to create HPMAs in 10% of their seas, after criticism following concerns from the fishing industry and island communities."
