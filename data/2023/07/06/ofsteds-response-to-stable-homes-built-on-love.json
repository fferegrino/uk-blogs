With additional resources and a sharp focus on existing and emerging best practice, I am sure we can all achieve our ambitions for children and families. But there are also areas that could be strengthened. Some of the proposals will develop as the Department for Education (DfE) continues to work closely with the sector and care experienced children and adults. And of course, change in the child protection and care system needs to be well resourced, managed with great care and built on what works."

In the highest performing local authorities, practice already mirrors the reforms. We see sensitive and skilled social work practice with families set alongside a passionate, child-centred approach that can also act with authority and decisiveness when the family is not the right place. Even in local authorities that are performing less well, there are social workers who use their skills and expertise every day to make good decisions for children."

The distinction between families who need help and those in which there is significant risk to children is not easily drawn. Families\u2019 needs and risks to children are dynamic and can change very quickly. Where parents have a wide range of complex needs, or where parents are struggling to recognise and meet their children\u2019s needs, professionals can get drawn in to complex family dynamics."

The difference between family support and child protection is often about the degree of risk, not the nature of the support or approach required. Child protection and family support both need to be supportive as well as authoritative."

Some local authorities manage this well. But some poorly performing local authorities do not have enough social work oversight and do not emphasise support. This can lead to a more adult-focused approach that misses the needs of and risks to the child."

These checks and balances are most important when partnership working is not strong and local authority performance is poor. As the DfE gets ready to test the reforms, it will need to take account of how weaker authorities make improvements. Fortunately, the successful journeys many local authorities have been on are powerful case studies about the ingredients for great practice to thrive."

Sufficiency issues are a daily source of concern in local authorities around the country and here in Ofsted. Despite the ever-growing numbers of children\u2019s homes, we still do not have the right homes offering the right care for children. It is not just about available places - it is about the right homes in the right place that are properly regulated. Ofsted lacks the regulatory powers to tackle the saturation of homes that exists in some places."

They then remain in inappropriate placements (including unregistered children\u2019s homes) and are often deprived of their liberty. The government promised us additional powers to tackle unregistered children\u2019s homes, but these are yet to materialise. Solutions for these children will require a cross-government response. For example, the rising numbers of children with high level mental health needs mean that health, social care and justice placements need to be planned jointly and to better meet children\u2019s needs close to home."
