With a background in computer science, I started out writing code for submarines, while working with the UK Hydrographic Office on one of their charting systems, and I quickly found a love of all things data."

Some of my favourite projects included developing the first 3D-enabled national spatial data model for the Kingdom of Bahrain with the Survey and Land Registration Bureau (SLRB) mapping authority. This involved creating an intelligent 2D and 3D data model to aid decision-making across government, business and public services."

My role was to develop the technology and processes to ensure that data could be used by decision makers. This role really taught me the value of access to data for all, and how technology can support that to happen."

This was the organisation's first data specific role, and as Chief Data Architect, I was tasked with building the data capability of the organisation, developing the data strategy, recruiting an experienced team and building the underpinning technology to support all our work."

From a data architecture perspective, this provided a wealth of data sources, we focused on data and analysis of this data. Having worked with the organisation to set the data strategy, the team were kept busy delivering an in-depth data literacy programme, developing cutting edge data science, and building a data democracy to ensure colleagues could access data at the right time, when they needed it."
