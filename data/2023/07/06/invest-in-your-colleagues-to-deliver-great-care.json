Throughout my time at Vida, I\u2019ve worked to transform the HR department to support the development of every individual. This is particularly important when working somewhere with a hugely diverse workforce. Every person is different, so we aim to work flexibly, to make sure we\u2019re taking the right route for each person."

An essential part of the job is encouraging colleagues to not go through the motions of the job description, but make sure they really do understand and align with the values we\u2019re trying to promote."

At a time when the social care sector is experiencing ongoing recruitment crises, this has never been more important."
