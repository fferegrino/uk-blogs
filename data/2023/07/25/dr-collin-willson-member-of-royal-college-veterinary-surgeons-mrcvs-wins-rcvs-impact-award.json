The challenge has been that this work protecting public health, animal health & welfare and underpinning international trade often goes unnoticed by the public and frequently by the wider veterinary profession. Our colleagues in the clinical veterinary world hold the public imagination much more and yet, without undermining clinical practice, the profession also offers many other interesting opportunities and career paths."

Collin has a lifetime of achievements which deserve nominations in their own right but the \u2018catapult\u2019 for this particular award is his vital work on welfare at slaughter, especially his work with the Halal meat industry. The ongoing impact of his work will positively affect millions of animals and knowing Collin, he will just shrug and continue making a difference in his own humble way."
