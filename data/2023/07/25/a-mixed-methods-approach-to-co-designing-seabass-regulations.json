Policy Lab partnered with them in the lead up to a formal consultation process to facilitate a nationwide co-design process to develop ideas for the new regulation. All four of our reports are included here (p163 onwards)."

We had feedback that our approach inspired trust, dialogue and consensus across fragmented stakeholder landscapes - something critical to maintaining sustainable management of natural resources, such as our seas.\u00a0"

In Policy Lab, we often do this through ethnography. Put simply, an ethnographic approach is about spending time with people to understand their lived experiences, in our case with fishing for Seabass.\u00a0"

Joining a fishing trip with recreational fishers, spending a day in a commercial port, attending an angling competition and visiting fish markets helped us gain rich perspectives on the importance of Seabass fishing for people who build their lives or livelihoods around it."

Regardless of the length and nature of our engagement, the effect was equally powerful - we started to unpick some of the common, as well as more specific, issues, barriers and opportunities experienced by different individuals and interest groups. You can see our lived experience report here (p. 260)\u00a0 and watch our summary film below."

In order to do that, we launched a week-long online \u2018collective intelligence\u2019 debate using Pol.is -\u00a0 a tool which Policy Lab has been experimenting with since 2021."

Across the debate week over 270 participants from a wide variety of stakeholder types, gear types and regions of England and Wales cast almost 140,000 votes and contributed over 670 statements.

Rich discussions from workshops, married with a high volume of responses via the survey, gave us a great sense of what solutions would work (or not work) in practice. To make sure that we got it right, we further tested our findings in an expert workshop as well as a wider co-refine survey.\u00a0 You can see the full co-design report here (p. 397)."
