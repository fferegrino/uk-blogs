I\u2019m really pleased to share that some key services have reached \u2018great\u2019 already, like HMRC\u2019s pay your self assessment tax bill, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\u2019 register to vote and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency\u2019s (DVSA) record MOT test results."

Cyber experts have created a Secure by Design framework to help departments create services that keep citizen and government data safe. We\u2019ve also helped departments measure the risk and effort of running outdated legacy technology, and to accelerate their path to using cloud services. And we\u2019re responding to one of the biggest emerging technology opportunities and challenges in the world today by publishing guidance on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and creating a team to help civil servants use this technology responsibly, confidently and effectively."

The vital work of these professionals is being supported by further adoption of the Pay Framework, now across 32 organisations, helping to reduce reliance on contractors and save taxpayer money. Meanwhile, more than 600 senior civil servants have been upskilled in digital and data essentials, helping build a cadre of leaders with cutting edge skills to get the most out of digital in every department."

We have published a new version of the digital functional standard to guide senior leaders on how to manage digital, data and technology in government. We\u2019ve also developed a framework for good product-centric ways of working, helping teams work together to deliver the high quality digital products and services that citizens need. And we continue to offer guidance, support and assurance to help teams maximise productivity and maintain high standards of delivery."
