We\u2019ll be relentless in protecting every community because we know that it\u2019s often the most vulnerable people who have the worse health outcomes. These health inequalities are unfair for those directly impacted but also come at a great cost to wider society, so our plan talks about the action we will take with our partners to achieve more equitable outcomes for all."
