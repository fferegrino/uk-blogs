Around 1.8 million people in the UK are using telecare devices."

Is there a telecare system already in place and is it compatible with a smoke alarm system? Does the change in circumstances mean there is a need to also make use of specialist devices, such as those to prevent falls or other smart home technologies?"

Technology which supports a person's care should be referenced in any relevant care planning documentation, or digital social care record. This not only makes sure it is embedded into an overall approach to care, it also means its use is reviewed and updated as any preferences or needs change."

We offer a unique perspective, one that holds technology to account to the standards, ethics and practices we ourselves adhere to. Reviewing care plans allows us to consider its use as part of an individual\u2019s holistic care package, working with other local authority and care colleagues to provide high quality care."

The risks of seeing it through a siloed lens, disconnected from a person\u2019s experience of care, comes with great risk, yet social workers can bring a positive, person-centred perspective to how it is used by people drawing on care and support."
