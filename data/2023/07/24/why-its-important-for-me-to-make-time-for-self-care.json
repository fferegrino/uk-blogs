This means making time to prep for the day ahead to make sure I eat healthy and balanced meals. Those who I work closely with will already know that I really enjoy my food, and it\u2019s important to me to keep fuelled up so I maintain my energy and concentration levels."

Having people that I can be open and honest with about challenges, fears or concerns helps by not only from hearing other people\u2019s perspectives, but also takes the burden away from having something bottled-up which in itself can provide a sense of relief."

It isn\u2019t always a work-related conversation, and offers an opportunity to connect us, build networks, and get to know each other better across our widely dispersed teams in DDTS."
