In between dropping our ice-creams on our feet and taking a large bite of sandy sandwich, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that we\u2019ll take some time to appreciate the landscapes around us: warm sand spilling between our toes, the magic seaweed gardens of a sheltered rockpool, an oystercatcher letting out a shrill hu-eep as it skims over the mudflats.\u00a0"

They also underpin the healthy functioning of ecosystems at a much broader scale, among other things by providing food, refuge, and nesting habitat for wading birds and seabirds.\u00a0"

Surveyors went out on foot on the sediments near the shore, while areas further out were surveyed by hovercraft. "

For example, once we\u2019ve predicted the quantity of shellfish required to maintain bird populations, we\u2019ll have a better sense of how much humans can harvest before the birds (and also local residents and visiting tourists) start to suffer from the competition."
