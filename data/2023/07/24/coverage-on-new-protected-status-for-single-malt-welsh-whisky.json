The scheme provides a guarantee to consumers that the product they are buying is the authentic local Single Malt and protects Single Malt Welsh Whisky producers from imitation products."

            "text": "Dating back to 1887, Single Malt Welsh Whisky is made using malted barley and water of 100% Welsh origin, with each step of the production process taking place in Wales, from brewing to bottling. The moderate and damp Welsh climate allows for an even rate of maturation, producing a smooth and refreshing flavour."
