The results can be found on our Swimfo website, enabling you to make an informed choice about where to take a dip."

For information about storm overflow spills, you can visit water company websites directly."

This is a significant improvement; using past data we estimate that, if current standards had been in place in the 1990s, over half of bathing waters would have failed. This is as a result of \u00a32.5 billion investment driven by the Environment Agency, increased monitoring and partnership projects to improve water quality."

The Bathing Water regulations allow us to disregard up to 15% of samples over 4 years, but we exclude very few samples - last year, for example, we excluded less than 1% of samples. This included four samples which were taken during pollution incidents or extreme rainfall and 58 samples taken when bathers were proactively warned of weather conditions likely to lead to a drop in quality."

By disregarding these abnormal samples, the overall classification assessment will be a more reflective picture of the range of quality usually found at this bathing water."

Rivers don\u2019t have the benefit of the natural disinfection that occurs in salty coastal waters, and bathers are more likely to come into contact with the bugs that can make humans ill because they won\u2019t have had the time or distance needed to dilute, which they have by the time they reach \u00a0the sea."

The agriculture sector, water companies and local communities are working with us to find solutions and drive the improvements that we all want to see."
