It linked well with Key Stage 4 too, where we teach about \u201cincome and expenditure, credit and debt, insurance, savings, pensions and how public money is raised and spent\u201d. The session also supported the wider money skills lessons we teach in PSHE, form time activities, and maths content we deliver during Moneywise week."

This will continue valuable learning that will help prepare our students to not only navigate the current economic climate, but also to prepare them for their lives as independent, responsible and active citizens."
