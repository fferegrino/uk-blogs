Helen Whately, Minister for Social Care, has written to care colleagues and local authorities, reinforcing the critical \u201csteps needed so that adult social care systems are resilient and able to provide people and their carers with the support they need this winter.\u201d"

For social care nurses in particular, it will be useful to understand how NHS organisations will work with care providers to deliver the healthiest outcomes. It\u2019s also gratifying to see the emphasis on a holistic approach, which I and others in the sector have long espoused. As the Minister point out in her letter:"
