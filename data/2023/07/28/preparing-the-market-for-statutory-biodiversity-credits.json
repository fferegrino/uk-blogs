It is a last resort alternative to on-site and off-site habitat. This means that a developer must first look to deliver the mandatory biodiversity net gain of ten per cent either on-site or off-site. If this is not possible \u2013 and the developer can provide evidence to the Local Planning Authority that they have been unable to achieve BNG through on-site and off-site options \u2013 then they may buy a statutory biodiversity credit."
