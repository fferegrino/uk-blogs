But it was my relocation to the UK in 2006 which was a massive culture change for me. I continued my studies in 2012 and completed my Master\u2019s degree in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0"

I always wanted to work for a government organisation, so when I saw a job advert for HMRC, I knew it was the perfect opportunity for me. I was excited to join an organisation that is committed to public service and provides a rewarding career, and I was impressed by the diversity of the workforce and the opportunities for career development.\u00a0"
