            "text": "The move to enshrine these new powers in law was covered by Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme, The Times, The Independent, Press Association, The Daily Express, Evening Standard, Daily Star, CityAM, Bloomberg and Reuters, amongst others. The Environment Secretary was also interviewed on Farming Today on the issue while attending the Great Yorkshire Show. There was further coverage in regional and financial trade titles, such as the Northern Echo and Insurance Journal."

            "text": "The current limit of \u00a3250,000 on variable monetary penalties that the Environment Agency and Natural England can impose directly on operators will be lifted, following a government consultation which received widespread public support. This will offer regulators a quicker method of enforcement than lengthy and costly criminal prosecutions \u2013 although the most serious cases will continue to be taken through criminal proceedings."

            "text": "New powers will also enable these higher penalties to be levied as a civil sanction for offences under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016, the regime under which the majority of Environment Agency investigations take place. This\u00a0will ensure regulators have the right tools to drive compliance across a range of sectors, strengthening enforcement and holding all who hold environmental permits \u2013 from energy and water companies to waste operators and incinerators \u2013 to greater account."

The Environmental Performance Assessment report shows some modest improvements to water company star ratings in 2022, compared to 2021. The findings were covered by The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The i and Utility Week, amongst others."

The ratings take into account performance on environmental commitments such as pollution incidents and treatment work compliance. Although there have been some improvements, all water companies need to go further and faster in improving their environmental performance."
