Faced with a changing climate, these ecosystems can all be part of necessary adaptation responses, and even part of mitigation action.\u00a0 So new opportunities may arise to invest further in them.\u00a0 But to do this wisely, we must ensure there is a joined-up plan around coastal restoration which takes into account efforts in the catchment inland and the interactions of ecosystems along the coast and out to sea."

So is the economy of the coast, with new industries replacing old, and people are relocating along the coast, using it in different ways. All of this creates opportunities for when change can happen, and we need to be ready for that, and make sure nature is part of the decisions about how we use land around our coasts so it is fit for the 21st Century."

This will give us the opportunity not only to work more smartly, with greater understanding at our fingertips, but also to think about more projects that join up along catchments or along coastlines, which in turn can meet wider objectives in areas such as regeneration, coastal protection or even tourism."

We can also demonstrate the vision of the Dasgupta Review too, striking a new balance which incorporates nature into our economic activities, and gets us on a more sustainable footing that grows our natural capital alongside other forms of capital that we develop."
