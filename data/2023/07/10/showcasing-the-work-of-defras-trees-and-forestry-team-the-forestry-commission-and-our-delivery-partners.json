It was humbling to learn about the experiences of these pioneering women of two World Wars, who faced immense hardship and discrimination as they contributed to the war effort, taking traditionally male roles across the Forestry industry. It doubles as a celebration of women in forestry, past and present, and Naomi was privileged to join an incredible line-up of inspiring women who spoke at the launch event. A thriving, skilled forestry workforce must be inclusive and open to all. We hope the exhibition has inspired the next generation of women in forestry to expand, protect and improve our forests, woods and trees."
