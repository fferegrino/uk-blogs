            "text": "Over the next two decades, the NDA\u2019s mission will expand to include the decommissioning of the 7 AGR power stations that are currently operated by EDF Energy.\u00a0 Before this can happen, NDA, EDF Energy, Sellafield Ltd and Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) need to collaborate on a programme of work which will see electricity generation at the Power Stations end where we will transition into the \u201cdefuelling\u201d phase.\u00a0 This phase is expected to last for between 3 and 5 years and it is where all of the used nuclear fuel is safely and securely removed from reactors and then transported to Sellafield for long term safe and secure storage.\u00a0 Once all of the spent nuclear fuel has been removed, each of the AGR power stations will transfer one by one into NDA ownership and, via Magnox Ltd, the necessary decommissioning activities will continue."

In the spirit of our mission advancing further, we\u2019re recognising a significant milestone being achieved in recent weeks."

            "text": "Over a sustained four-week period, an average of 9 spent fuel flasks per week have been received at Sellafield from EDF Energy\u2019s AGR Power Stations, the first time this has been achieved in over 25 years. This has been a longstanding target and is something that we now need to sustain for several years to come.\u00a0 This success is the culmination of years of preparation and planning between the NDA, Sellafield, Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) and EDF Energy."

        {
            "text": "NTS is responsible for collecting the fuel and transporting it via the UK rail network to Sellafield, where it is then received at the Fuel Handling Plant (FHP). The fuel is dismantled at Sellafield to free-up empty skips that can then be returned to the power stations to enable a continuous stream of spent fuel to be transported to Sellafield for long term safe and secure storage."
        },
        {
            "text": "What makes this achievement particularly special is that despite fewer flasks than usual being available over recent months, teams at Sellafield within FHP have managed to support the increasing demands of EDF Energy\u2019s defueling and electricity-generating power stations at pace, meaning that the flasks received from the AGRs have had to be processed for return much quicker than usual."

            "text": "We\u2019re currently on track to complete defueling at Hunterston and Hinkley Point B in 2025 and soon after the ownership of the AGR power stations will transfer to Magnox Ltd, continuing the safe and secure decommissioning that we\u2019re tasked in achieving. Whilst we\u2019ve made a fantastic start to defueling, there is still more work to be done.\u00a0 The NDA group is working at pace to maintain this level of performance for a number of years. By investing today in the challenges left over from the UK\u2019s proud nuclear history, we can remove the burden for future generations and continue to deliver social and environmental benefits through our jobs, knowledge, skills, technology, and social investment."
