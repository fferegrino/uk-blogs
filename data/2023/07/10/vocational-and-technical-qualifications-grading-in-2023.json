For other assessments awarding organisations set grade boundaries after students have taken the assessment.\u00a0\u00a0 As normal, senior examiners review student work and look at data on student performance. They balance this information to set grade boundaries. Awarding organisations will expect broadly the same quality of work at each grade as they did before the pandemic. However, where possible, senior examiners will monitor for any evidence of disruption and consider it when setting grade boundaries.\u00a0 Awarding organisations have been taking this approach since assessments restarted after the pandemic. This means that students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged if they took assessments early in their course, or at the end.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0"

            "text": "The range of qualifications available to students has changed since before the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic itself means that students may be making different decisions about the qualifications they take. \u00a0 Reformed Level 3 qualifications (such as BTEC Nationals or L3 Cambridge Technicals) were introduced shortly before the pandemic. \u00a0The reformed qualifications introduced external assessment, often in the form of traditional written exams, though a large percentage of assessment remains as coursework. \u00a0Schools and colleges have been moving across to the reformed qualifications over time, and funding for the old qualifications was removed for students starting qualifications from August 2020, so entry numbers have increased over time. For some schools and colleges, due to the use of teacher assessed grades in the pandemic, this will be the first year that students have taken external assessments for the reformed qualifications. \u00a0These changes mean that even though the approach to grading in 2023 may be similar to 2019, the pattern of grades achieved may look different from 2019. \u00a0As for all qualifications, the return to formal assessments means that outcomes are expected to be lower than outcomes in 2022. \u00a0Universities and employers are aware of this and have taken this into consideration when making offers to students. Awarding organisations are monitoring for evidence of disruption, as set out elsewhere in this blog, so that students are not advantaged or disadvantaged whatever qualification they are taking. \u00a0"
