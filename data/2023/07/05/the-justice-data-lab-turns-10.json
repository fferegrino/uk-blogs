            "text": "For organisations working to reduce reoffending, being able to evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions is paramount. This requires access to relevant data, and the expertise and time to undertake appropriate analysis. Third sector organisations cannot access central reoffending data, because it is extremely sensitive information about individuals. This, combined with the need for specialist analysis, means that for many organisations working with people across their journeys through the criminal justice system, there would be no way to evaluate their work if the Justice Data Lab did not exist."

This provides third sector organisations with a vital source of impartial and rigorous evidence that can be used to improve their work and secure essential funding."

Within that time, we have produced 179 reports and have worked with over 50 organisations across the third sector, who provide all types of interventions from education, to accommodation, to justice system reform. Previously we have worked with The Clink, a vocational training programme which gives people in prison skills, qualifications, and routes to employment in catering and restaurant work; the Greater Manchester Intensive Community Order programme, which works with young male offenders who have received community orders in place of short custodial sentences; and the CHANGES programme at Nottingham Women\u2019s Centre, which provides individualised support to women across 9 resettlement pathways in order to prevent reoffending."

As experts in the use of PSM for evaluation, we also receive requests from other teams in the Ministry of Justice to advise them on the use of this technique. Previously we have run an initiative we call JDL School, where we walk other teams through our methodology to share our expertise and up-skill others in propensity score matching. Now, in our 10th year, we\u2019re very pleased to announce the relaunch of our JDL School programme.\u00a0"
