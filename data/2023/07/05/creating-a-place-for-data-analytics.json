You can do some great things with Excel, but I could see the potential for teams if they had easy access to data science tooling on MODNET, MOD\u2019s internal network. This would help them to exploit the right data at the right time."

My team and I have been involved throughout the development of the platform to build out use cases to test functionality and feed back to the engineering team on improvements and new features. The best thing about this service is that it\u2019s available across MOD, so anyone can request the creation of a tenant (a secure area within the platform for you or your team to work) to start using the tools available on your own data."

This is where there isn\u2019t a massive development project pre-planned over several years with a team of data scientists, engineers and developers, but someone with an interest and the motivation to see what they can do with their data. Nobody knows their data or their problems better than the people working on it day to day, so providing them with easy access to the right tools is fantastic."
