And when landmark anniversaries come round, it\u2019s an opportunity to reflect, not just on their continued purpose, but on the many ways they have transformed our lives for the better."

Their anniversaries also celebrate the beginnings of longstanding relationships with some equally important partners. The seventy-fifth anniversary of the NHS on 5 July is a case in point. At the moment of its foundation in 1948, the social care sector, as a collaboration of care providers, services and professionals, also came into being."

According to the Royal College of Nursing, in 1948, \u201cthere were 54,000 nursing vacancies in the NHS and many of those arriving from the Caribbean helped to fill those places. The following year, the Ministry of Health began working with the Colonial Office, as well as the RCN and General Nursing Council, to actively recruit nurses from the Caribbean.\u201d"

While more progress is needed, thanks to our collective efforts to boost representation, not least through the Florence Nightingale Foundation\u2019s work with global majority nurses, we can truly say the Windrush generation have helped inspire nurses from all backgrounds to pursue careers in care and health."

We are that essential bridge between hospital and community, providing the continuance of care and support, with a person-centred holistic focus. So, it\u2019s no accident we choose to refer to this broad and complex network of professions, services and resources as the health and care system \u2013 the two sectors are co-dependent and, in many areas, the overlap is increasing, especially in the case of social care nursing. This is a good thing."

These clinical actions, including insulin supervision, wound dressing and mental health support, allow us to provide consistent, continuous, person-centred care. It\u2019s what residents and their families want: familiar faces they can trust to deliver safe, high quality care, with the needs and wishes of the recipient at the heart of the process."

The social care sector will remain a constant and essential partner in its continued existence and I applaud every care and NHS colleague for their continued dedication to this triumph of modern civilisation. The challenges it faces have never been greater, but our belief in the greater good will see the health and care system prevail for generations to come."
