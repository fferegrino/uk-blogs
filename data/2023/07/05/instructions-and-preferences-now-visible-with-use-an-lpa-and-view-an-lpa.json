Previously, you couldn\u2019t see the detail of any instructions and preferences so if an LPA had them attorneys would often have to supply the original LPA if details needed to be verified. This was time consuming and often hard to manage so we hope these changes make sharing details of an LPA easier for donors, attorneys and organisations.\u00a0"
