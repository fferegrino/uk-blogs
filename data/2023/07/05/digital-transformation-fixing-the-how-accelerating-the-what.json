This event brought together public sector colleagues from across the Federal and State levels to get the latest updates, share best practice and network. I delivered the International Keynote address and then joined in a number of panel and roundtable discussions, which were fun and thought provoking. PSN also arranged for me to meet with Federal and State digital colleagues throughout the week - more of that in a later blog\u2026"

Furthermore, as digital is intrinsic to organisational constructs and service delivery, any transformational endeavours must have a strong digital element to them. Beware though, any transformation needs to be led by the business not the digital function; as the saying goes the digital tail should not wag the business dog!"

This is understandable and natural, as very often we need results and we need them yesterday. However I have always felt this is the wrong end of the telescope, starting with the What and not the How and my counsel as a digital leader has always been more focused on the latter than the former. I even found a Gartner slide to support this premise, apparently 15x impact delivered through focusing on the How - thanks Gartner!\u00a0"

Across the organisational Pillars (silos!) we had smatterings of product, delivery and service; operating in isolation and attempting to deal with organisational constraints team by team - we were delivering despite the system not being enabled by it!"

This vision encapsulated our renewed purpose and mission - enabling through the provision of exemplary digital, data and technology products and services. Transforming through providing digital leadership to the organisation acting as a digital partner that advised and assured and a digital delivery partner doing both of those things along with addressing the problem space of the organisation through a laser focus on users and product.\u00a0"

He introduced me to the late Paul Shetler\u2019s work \u201cSquare of Despair\u201d which must be a good model, as it rhymes\u2026!
