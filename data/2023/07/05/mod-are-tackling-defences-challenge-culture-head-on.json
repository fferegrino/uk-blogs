One of the best ways of doing this is to rely on the help of MOD personnel, along with civilians and contractors who work on MOD sites, to challenging suspicious behaviours when they see them.\u00a0"

            "text": "This is why the \u2018Challenge Me\u2019 initiative was established in 2022. During the month of March trained teams are sent to various MOD establishments across the UK, and sometimes overseas to display low-level suspicious or risky behaviours in the hope that personnel will spot and confidently challenge the team to ensure the sites\u2019 safety.\u00a0"

            "text": "Using mobile phones in prohibited areas and tailgating through security entrances are just two examples of behaviours that should be challenged. No matter how harmless they may seem, these may be the types of behaviours exhibited by someone who isn\u2019t authorised to be there, thus posing a high security risk. That is why this initiative is so important.\u00a0"

            "text": "Through exercises such as this, the MOD hope to develop and encourage a positive, constructive challenge culture across Defence. It is key to the safety of Defence that all personnel feel comfortable in challenging and being challenged in a polite, safe, and assertive manner, regardless of seniority or rank.\u00a0"

            "text": "The main thing to keep in mind when challenging suspicious behaviours across MOD establishments, is that the positive outcome of challenging a genuine threat will always outweigh the cost of politely challenging a simple mistake or misunderstanding. Keeping Defence safe by constructively challenging is something that must happen throughout the entire year, not just when initiatives like this are running.\u00a0"
