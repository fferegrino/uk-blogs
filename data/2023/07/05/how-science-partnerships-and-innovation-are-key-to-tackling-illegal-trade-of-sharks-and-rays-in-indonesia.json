The strong collaboration between Cefas, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF), Republic of Indonesia, Rekam Nusantara Foundation, and the University of Salford, UK was key to the success of this project which completed in March 2023. A few months on from completion, we look back at some of the successes of our partnership to tackle illegal trade of sharks and rays in Indonesia.\u00a0"

In an effort to control trade, over 150 species of sharks and rays are currently listed within the appendices of the\u202fConvention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),\u202fan international agreement which aims to regulate international trade in wildlife for its protection. But because products from sharks and rays are diverse and processed in many different ways (e.g. fins can be fresh, frozen, dried, bleached), being able to tell what species of shark a product comes from is a huge challenge for staff at fishing ports, trade hubs and international borders.\u00a0"

In collaboration with MMAFs training centre, we developed an intensive five-day \u2018train the trainer\u2019 programme made up of eight modules with both taught and practical elements. Module topics include shark and ray conservation legislation, biology and ecology of sharks and rays, sampling statistics and reporting, visual identification of CITES listed sharks and rays, and DNA sampling techniques.\u00a0\u00a0"

This workshop marked the first step for standardised training for MMAF\u2019s shark and ray training agenda and has been adopted by the MMAF Training Centre as part of the annual standardised training for new employees (including government staff from regional trade offices and quarantine, as well as participants from universities and the private sector). Since the 20 expert trainers were trained in January 2020, they have gone on to deliver the standardised programme to over 200 of their colleagues across the regional offices. The training was reinforced through post-training testing across the eight modules, with high test scores across the board evidencing the success of this approach."

Andhika and his family moved to Manchester in the UK in January 2019 to undertake his PhD at the University of Salford with molecular ecologist Dr Allan McDevitt and Professor Stefano Mariani. Whether it is a frozen fillet, a dried and processed fin or liver oil, some shark products simply cannot be visually identified.\u00a0\u00a0"

Over 579 tissue samples were collected from shark export hubs, processing plants, collectors, inspectors\u2019 offices, and landing sites across Java Island, Indonesia. Field based DNA sampling techniques are urgently needed to improve our understanding of trade. We tested a recently developed method (known as FastFish-ID) and found the method worked for 25 out of 28 species, 20 of which were CITES- listed. However, the illicit trade may be hidden from inspection, and that is a challenge for testing individual tissue samples. The \u2018shark-dust\u2019 approach developed by Andhika and team, tests dust or processing residues which revealed 27 more taxa than individual tissue-based techniques and found that over 80% belonged to CITES-listed species.\u00a0\u00a0"

Eleven representatives from MMAF, regional trade offices and Rekam Nusantara Foundation attended with the aim of sharing knowledge with UK scientists and policy makers on how to best use scientific evidence when making national policies on the management of shark and ray fisheries and trade. Workshop attendees met at the Cefas Lowestoft laboratory where they shared scientific presentations and discussed how to implement evidence-based management of fisheries and trade. During their trip, they also visited Heathrow\u2019s Animal Reception Centre to share experiences on inspection processes for animal transportation and shark products, before meeting with Defra policy teams in London to discuss how the IWTCF is supporting the implementation of CITES shark listings in Indonesia."

To increase international uptake and use of the trunk guide, we joined a global collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other partner and funding organizations (including the CITES Secretariat, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the European Union, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and Shark Conservation Fund) to include the guide in a three-volume series that covers whole animals, shark trunks and dried products such as shark fins and devil ray gill plates. The guides were officially launched in March 2022 and presented at a joint UK/Indonesia hosted side event at CITES 19th Conference of the Parties.\u00a0"

Considering the increasing trend to list sharks and rays in CITES Appendix II, continued improvement and application of technologies is needed.
