Britons endured rationing (which continued after the war was over), evacuation, destruction or damage to millions of homes and workplaces, air raids as well as the mass pivoting of the nation\u2019s people and resources to meet the vast war effort. The period between the First and Second World Wars had also left its mark. The interwar years were a time of economic depression and social deprivation, there had been no great development of state provision. Attlee and his Cabinet had lived through (and in many cases fought in) both wars and recognised the need for reconstruction and expansion \u2013 a comprehensive welfare system was at the heart of this."

            "text": "During the Second World War, the coalition government led by Conservative Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Leader of the Labour Party Clement Attlee (Deputy Prime Minister from 1942) seized on the need for post war reconstruction. Despite the preoccupation with fighting a world war, the government prioritised planning for this. In June 1941, Labour minister Arthur Greenwood announced to the House of Commons that a new committee had been formed to survey existing social security provision and allied services under the chairmanship of Sir William Beveridge.[2] This became the totemic 1942 Beveridge Report, which identified \u2018Five Giants\u2019 that needed to be tackled in order for Britain to succeed economically and socially. The five giants were Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Influential economist and civil servant John Maynard Keynes was also consulted by Beveridge during the making of the report. At his suggestion Beveridge modified some recommendations, thus Keynes believed the plan to be broadly affordable.[3]"

The recommendations of the Beveridge Report widened the scope set by Lloyd George\u2019s National Insurance Act (1911). Beveridge offered a blueprint for a comprehensive welfare state. In the years after publication, the coalition government worked on plans for turning the recommendations into reality, including producing a White Paper. Full implementation was however not guaranteed. In March 1943, Churchill warned against imposing significant new expenditures without knowing the full post war economic picture; yet he also advocated a \u2018national compulsory insurance for all classes for all purposes from the cradle to the grave.\u2019[6]"

Indeed Labour had entered the election offering \u2018the full Beveridge\u2019.[8] Attlee\u2019s \u2018executive efficiency\u2019 would be integral to introducing and implementing such a huge programme.[9] Though Britain and its allies had emerged victorious, the strain of total war had left the country in a desperate state.

Attlee wrote, \u2018I have witnessed now the acceptance by all leading politicians in this country and all the economists of any account of the conception of the utilisation of abundance.\u2019[11] In 1918 as a soldier in the First World War Attlee expounded his sense of purpose, \u2018We live in a state of society where the vast majority live stunted lives \u2013 we endeavour to give them a freer life.\u2019[12]"

Subsequently the US made a further loan agreement with Britain however Hugh Dalton, Attlee\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer (1945-47) noted that the situation remained \u2018desperately difficult\u2019.[13] US Marshall Aid from 1948 until 1951 would also provide critical support for the British economy. Attlee, in assembling his Cabinet, appointed the political firebrand, South Wales miner and trade unionist Aneurin Bevan as Minister of Health. The King\u2019s Speech on 15th August 1945 outlined an ambitious legislative programme including nationalisation of the fuel and power industries, civil aviation, Bank of England as well as establishing a National Health Service.[14] Chancellor Hugh Dalton worked closely with Bevan to establish the financial foundation for the introduction of the NHS. Dalton found Bevan\u2019s vitality and drive impressive, and Bevan\u2019s biographer credits Dalton as \u2018after Bevan \u2026 the chief architect\u2019 of the NHS.[15]"

Minster of Health, Bevan set about building on the Beveridge Report and the coalition government\u2019s White Paper. In October 1945, Bevan outlined his vision for a National Health Service. In December, he explained to Cabinet that this was \u2018an opportunity, which may not recur for years, for a thorough overhaul and reconstruction of the country\u2019s health position.\u2019[17] Prime Minister Attlee drew on a cricket metaphor to express his approval, Bevan had done well \u201con a pretty sticky wicket\u201d.[18] Provisions would include hospital care, ambulance services, GP services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as optical care and dentistry.[19]"

It was an arduous process to say the least. What\u2019s more, the NHS was one of a series of reforms which formed the welfare state. How the state would pay for these reforms was a huge matter for the government of the day. Keynes had told the War Cabinet in May 1945 that Britain faced a \u2018financial Dunkirk\u2019.[20] The 1946 National Insurance Act[21] extended the contributions of working age people (except married women) in order to contribute to funding the provisions of the welfare state."
