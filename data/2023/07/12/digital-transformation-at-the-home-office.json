These systems have transformed border crossings by significantly reducing wait times, enhancing security through biometric authentication and providing a self-service experience that improves traveller convenience, while allowing Border Control Officers to focus on analysing risks. This progress with e-gates has been down to the hard work of everyone in our Digital Services at the Border Programme, which has digitised regular migration and provided a single view of people crossing the border using the Person Centric Data Platform.\u00a0"

Atlas automates large parts of the immigration casework process and will ultimately eradicate the use of paper. Information from historic case files have also been migrated onto the new platform so case workers can easily access all the data they need to. Our colleagues can now spend more time identifying potential security risks, ensuring the safety of the public. Meanwhile applications of those who are migrating to the UK are dealt with far more swifty, thereby improving the user experience.\u202f\u00a0"
