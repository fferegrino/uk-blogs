CQC\u2019s report Promoting sexual safety through empowerment (2020) examined sexual incidents within social care across all groups of people who access it. CQC found that sex remains a \u2018taboo\u2019 subject, with a resistance to discuss and raise concerns, leaving people vulnerable to abuse."

No \u2018off the shelf\u2019 training pack existed and most staff were not receiving training despite a clear need."
