This criminal operation was a deliberate and premeditated act to circumvent our permitting system, to avoid paying necessary landfill taxes to HMRC and to undercut legitimate operators."

A 360-excavator machine was also on site, used dig out an area we found to be heavily filled in with contaminated shredded mixed waste. A crescent shaped mound had been constructed of mixed trommel fines to create a bunding area of contaminated infill, where water had begun to pond; this was contaminated with run-off from the waste, known to be leachate which is a by-product from the waste.\u00a0 The odour was very offensive and made officers feel physically sick."

The passenger ran off leaving the driver, who following checks was arrested for driving offences and fraud. The police officer contacted our enforcement officers who attended the scene and observed approximately eight large vehicle loads had been deposited of very smelly shredded mixed waste. Following his experience of joint working with our enforcement team, the police officer was quick to recognise potential waste crime, meaning this tipping was stopped before it became an even worse problem."
