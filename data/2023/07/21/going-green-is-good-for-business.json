Recycling is also important within a business environment and making it convenient and as easy to do as possible helps to improve your business' recycling efforts. Placing paper recycling bins near desks and printers, putting plastic recycling bins in canteens or lunch areas, and introducing used battery collection stations in high-traffic areas can help."
