As the wide array of problems brought to ACE to help solve has shown, making better use of data can benefit everyone from bed planners and radiologists at NHS hospitals to frontline officers and counterterrorism police. Better crime prevention, faster solving of crimes and more efficient and faster diagnoses are just some of the benefits from commissions we have worked on. Data itself, meanwhile, is firmly at the heart of leaps forward in artificial intelligence and machine learning."

        {
            "text": "But alongside the undoubted power and potential that data offers comes a corresponding responsibility; the need to be confident that every use is ethical. In our role as data stewards, this means, for each and every piece of work, taking time to understand the level of authority in place around using certain data, how we can ensure that the intended use, including any analytics, is transparent and trustworthy, and that it isn\u2019t used in unintended ways."

        {
            "text": "Even as we work to harness all the benefits that better and more intelligent use of data can bring, we devote considerable time to considering appropriate use, evaluating and managing any risks as they arise. Artifacts such as data processing agreements and data protection impact assessments help to bring rigour to the sharing and use of data. But these are used at the start of the journey and as we progress through technical development, considering and exploring potential bias in outputs and models is continuously undertaken to ensure it is ethically appropriate."

            "text": "We are proud that we have been thoughtful from the outset, always questioning whether proposed data uses are pushing the boundaries of innovation, or threatening to push in a direction that could be potentially problematic as we consider all implications of all the work we are being asked to do."

            "text": "Sometimes that has led to tricky conversations \u2013 a recruiting service wanted to explore whether they could use AI to help sift through initial applications, for example. Technologically, this was certainly something we had the industrial and technical talent to scope and build \u2013 but an initial piece of research, undertaken at our suggestion, made it clear beyond doubt that a truly fair system was simply not possible, due to the likelihood of inherent bias in any data training sets used. The customer agreed, and the work did not go ahead in that form."

This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re complacent \u2013 we'll continue questioning ourselves and others, rigorously and constantly. But it was reassuring to be on the same page."

We don\u2019t just see data and associated innovation as a limitless asset to be tapped, but as a valuable resource that should only be used where it can have a positive impact and be part of creating a better world \u2013 for all of us."
