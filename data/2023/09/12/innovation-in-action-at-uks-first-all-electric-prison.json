The build is also being delivered in partnership with local stakeholders and communities, with over 40% of construction orders coming from within 50 miles of the site. This is a prime example of how the TIP theme of place-based regeneration is present throughout varying aspects of the programme."

This speaks to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of decent work and economic growth that promotes full and productive employment for all. SDGs are global agreements made at the UN level to improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth, while tackling climate change. Aligning the UN\u2019s SDGs with the built environment is a central part of continuing to implement TIP.\u00a0"

The build will use solar panels, heat pump technology and more efficient lighting systems to run the prison, meaning that it will use approximately a quarter of the energy used to heat traditional Victorian prisons. Aside from the positive environmental impacts, the improved energy efficiency of the project will bring down taxpayer energy costs by over \u00a31m per year.\u00a0"

New digital twin technology has been used that has the potential to increase the accuracy of tracking and interacting with building components, while only costing one third of the traditional alternative. The use of a digital twin to aid in the construction of the prison, modernises and accelerates infrastructure performance - a key part of realising the ambition of TIP."

This can be seen throughout the new prison estate, and continues with HMP Millsike. The blueprint of the project is based on the designs for HMP Five Wells, a project successfully delivered in 2022, and also brings in parts of a houseblock design used in another improvement project across prisons in the UK. The perimeter fence around the prison has similarly seen an innovative construction method applied to it, carried over from HMP Fosse Way."
