            "text": "This was the first tender I had managed for the trust, and I felt a little overwhelmed. Buying isn\u2019t my area of expertise and unfortunately there was no-one in my team that I could ask. I did some initial research to try and teach myself how to run a tender but there was lots of information out there and it all left me feeling very confused. It was difficult to know exactly where to start and I did not feel confident that I would be doing everything I needed to make sure it was compliant. Also, because it was my first tender, I wanted to make sure I had the right support and guidance to do a good job."

            "text": "I am a member of the National Network of Special Schools (NNOSS) so I reached out to my network colleagues to get advice direct from our sector. Colleagues recommended the Get help buying for schools service, which I had previously heard mentioned at a couple of conferences, in workshops and by guest speakers. It wasn\u2019t really my area of work until this first tender so I hadn\u2019t really paid too much attention, but it was somewhere in the back of my mind."

            "text": "I contacted the service through GOV.UK and received a response within a couple of days. There are helpful self-service tools on GOV.UK such as Create a specification and Find a Framework but because I wasn\u2019t confident enough to use those on my own, I requested the full level of support. This meant that I was allocated a procurement expert to support me through the entire process."
        },
        {
            "text": "I think it\u2019s fantastic that this full service is provided. Using a combination of the initial research I\u2019d done, the templates I\u2019d put together and the support from a procurement expert, I was able to put together a compliant tender."

            "text": "The support I received was excellent. I am not anticipating huge savings but that wasn\u2019t a priority. I know I have saved so much time and it has certainly put my concerns around compliancy to rest. The professional development I've gained is a fantastic added benefit of the service. Working through the process with a procurement expert has been a real learning curve and has certainly helped me to upskill."

            "text": "I would absolutely use Get help buying for schools again but next time I would feel confident to lead my own tender, using the Get help buying for schools service to check in if I needed to rather than relying on them to support me through the entire process."
