As a Digital Infrastructure and Security Operations team, we manage networking, voice, video, hosting, and day-to-day security for all parts of our organisation. Over the last year, we have been realising our Digital Strategy to support users better, exploit data, and be more flexible in our approach. Balancing these needs has been challenging and, in many use cases, there has always been a requirement to operate in a more private space."

Typically, private cloud runs on your own hardware and infrastructure as opposed to employing a third-party provider based around a transaction model. Everything sits on the provider's services, like Azure or AWS, and is accessed via a web browser or other interface."

So, while we forge ahead with our 'Cloud First' strategy, we acknowledge the value of our private cloud and on-premises 'DeLorean' vehicle, helping us navigate the present while we shape the future."

Embracing the ethos of a user-led organisation, our aim is to ensure that every interaction our users have with our Data Centres is seamless and satisfactory. In the last 9 months, we have made significant steps towards this goal. For example, we transitioned to portal services. Like the leap from a skateboard to a hoverboard, we have moved away from spreadsheets, a decision that has amplified the visibility of our operations team and enhanced transparency of activities within our premises. Now, everyone involved can have a more precise overview of the operations - a significant step towards improving efficiency."
