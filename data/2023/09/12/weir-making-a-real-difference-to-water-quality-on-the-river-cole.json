I provide specialist technical support, help to secure funding and bring people together into strong partnerships. The EA often provides funding for projects, matching contributions from partners, and in that case I\u2019ll sit on the steering board to ensure it\u2019s being delivered in line with our targets."

            "text": "One of our recent successes is removing Ackers Weir, a 2.6 metre high concrete barrier on the River Cole. The original weir was constructed in 1852 by Webster and Horsfall, a local metal works. The weir provided a water supply that was used to form and cool the metal. The whole time the weir has existed it has significantly disrupted all natural river processes, with sediments trapped upstream and no opportunity for the natural migration of fish and other aquatic organisms.\u00a0 It\u2019s fair to say that back in 1852 there just wasn\u2019t the understanding we have now of how environmentally damaging these structures could be! In total, there was 500m3 of contaminated sediments trapped behind the weir, containing a wide range of pollutants including heavy metals and hydrocarbons. It was a very depleted stretch of river."

The project was so successful that it was shortlisted for the Dam Removal Europe Award, a prestigious international award."

            "text": "Removing the weir and associated bed regrading means fish can now migrate for the first time in 170 years. It has restored natural processes and we have recorded significant water quality improvements. People are saying \u2018we can now hear the river\u2019 which, due to the impoundment, had previously been silent.\u00a0 Removing this weir is just the beginning of a long-term aspiration to enhance this degraded area of East Birmingham."

            "text": "This project came with a wide range of challenges and constraints including very restricted access, lack of funding, contaminated silts, asbestos, invasive species and lack of community engagement. It required a huge collaborative effort to make it happen. The removal of the weir as a stand-alone project didn\u2019t stack up financially, so we worked with partners to develop a wider project called the River Cole Community Commons Project. This included restoring and rehabilitating 55 acres of neglected land adjacent to the weir. This enabled us to access match funding through European Regional Development Funds to create a project that not only enhanced wildlife but also engaged local communities. It was\u00a0 really challenging to get the community to believe the project was worth it, as the area has been known for years as the \u2018lost world\u2019 with poor access, litter, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour. This project was as much about inspiring people to get involved and see it as their space too."

            "text": "The original plan for this project was to take the weir out and deliver a 900m river restoration project further downstream. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have sufficient funding to achieve this, so we are working hard with the University of Birmingham to secure additional funding to deliver this next year. The renaturalisation will create meanders, re-profile banks and in-channel features which will improve the habitat and access for people to enjoy again. This is just the beginning of work in this area, and we are already looking at other restoration opportunities along the River Cole and wider catchment."
