As a High Voltage technician, I learnt a whole new skill set and eventually moved into my first managerial role. I have had many engineering management roles and have managed a wide variety of teams."

I have always been fascinated by how the body works, the amazing things that people do and the amount that is still unknown. I had really inspirational science teachers in secondary school and was keen to continue studying it at university despite the career advice I got from teachers in School. I am the person that doesn\u2019t like being told \u201cyou can\u2019t do \u2026\u201d or \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to \u2026\u201d, so was even more determined to excel when my Head of Sixth Form said: \u201cScience wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d (Paraphrased.) He also said this to a few of my friends, so we created a study group to share learning. My family were so supportive in motivating me and sharing tips."

I literally googled \u2018child health jobs London\u2019 and found an amazing job. I worked there for a few years on mental health, disability and patient safety projects and child health research. I also got the opportunity to dabble in things I never considered before, such as marketing, social media and patient engagement. It opened my eyes to the importance of effectively communicating policy and research in a range of formats to ensure that the message is understood and acted upon."
