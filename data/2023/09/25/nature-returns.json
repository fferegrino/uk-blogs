            "text": "Nature Returns is about collaboration across government and the private sector to explore head-on some of the biggest challenges we face: how can we best use land across England to address climate change whilst producing food and promoting thriving nature? And, how can we work with companies and financial institutions to mobilise the billions in private investment that Government estimates we need to meet our national net zero commitments?"

            "text": "I\u2019ll admit they are significant challenges! In response to these challenges, Natural England has been leading a partnership with the Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, RBG Kew at Wakehurst and local partners. Our work is co-sponsored by Defra and DESNZ, which is helping to ensure that emerging results can be integrated into developing policy. All of this has been funded directly by HM Treasury Shared Outcomes Fund."

            "text": "We are working with our local partners across England to sample habitats at different stages of development. At Wakehurst, Kew's 'living laboratory' in Sussex, Kew scientists are collecting data above and below ground across a broad range of habitats in their wild botanic garden, from woodland to grassland and wetland."

            "text": "This partnership approach is allowing us to gather the evidence to fill gaps in our understanding of what really happens below the soil when new habitats are developed, what variation there is in different landscapes across England, and how carbon and greenhouse gas capture changes over time."

            "text": "We\u2019ve also been working closely with the Environment Agency whose Future Funding team has been exploring what approaches to blending public and private finance have proven successful, and how new approaches can help get the right investment in place to deliver for Nature and people. As part of this, they have been talking with major investors to understand what is standing in the way of unlocking the really significant private investment in nature that is needed."

            "text": "The Forestry Commission has been investigating the UK Voluntary Carbon Market, getting behind the surface to understand how the UK carbon credit schemes are working and helping to make better financial data available for those looking to be involved. This builds on the Forestry Commission\u2019s experience of running the Woodland Carbon Code for more than a decade."

Together, we are building a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities in recovering Nature and delivering sustainable solutions to our climate and biodiversity challenges."

This is good news for biodiversity and flood prevention. However, work to restore nature has been made more challenging as our weather becomes more unpredictable due to the impacts of climate change."

But to reap the returns, we need to invest in the research. Through Nature Returns, we are backing the science that asks what\u2019s really happening inside grasslands, floodplains and even orchards. Then we are connecting scientists, stakeholders and green investors to share what works, what doesn\u2019t, and why."
