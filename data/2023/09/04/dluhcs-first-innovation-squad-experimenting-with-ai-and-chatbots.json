A squad is a flat structure with no hierarchy and therefore having support in place helps the team focus on problem solving as opposed to operations. In our first pilot squad, we let the team self-manage but advised them to use scrum-style ceremonies. Next time, we\u2019ll schedule ceremonies for the squad by default. \n"
