In New Zealand they were able to eliminate all but the most technical of requisitions, moving to instantaneous processing of 87% of previously manual cases. There are obviously differences in property law between here and there, but not that make a material difference to the opportunity to improve the process."

There is a lot of effort in getting to that confident clarity that all can go ahead."

We are already seeing a huge reduction in some errors through our Digital Registration Service on the HM Land Registry portal.

It is not a change in the roles of the conveyancer and HM Land Registry. They tell us what happened and HM Land Registry decides how to register the transaction. It is just the most effective way of putting HM Land Registry in the position to make a secure decision, without an unnecessary to-and-fro."

So we have been working in a pilot with a few high-volume firms: Enact, Eversheds Sutherland, Optima and O\u2019Neill Patient. Thanks to them we have learned a lot about what would work and what might not work, and we\u2019ve taken all their feedback on board as we continue to design the process whilst working with the grain of conveyancing practice. We\u2019ll bring you more on that in another blog post soon, including on how lawyers and PropTech (property technology) businesses can get involved in its development as we continue and expand our tests."
