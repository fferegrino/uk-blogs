            "text": "We have brought the references to schools having a safeguarding \u2018culture\u2019 into a single clear definition. It explains how we will evaluate this during an inspection. The definition makes clear that we expect all schools to have an open and positive culture around safeguarding that puts pupils\u2019 interests first and protects them from serious harm."

        },
        {
            "text": "We have also added more clarity on what we mean when we say that schools need to make minor safeguarding improvements. Minor improvements are only things that do not have an immediate impact on the safety of pupils. This could include administrative errors in paperwork or out-of-date policies."
        },
        {
            "text": "Schools may be able to make minor safeguarding improvements before the end of their inspection. If they cannot, provided they have taken steps to resolve the issue, safeguarding can still be judged effective. If minor safeguarding improvements are identified, this will not stop a school being judged good or outstanding."

            "text": "For the small number of schools judged inadequate due to ineffective safeguarding alone, we will return for a monitoring inspection within 3 months. The process will broadly follow other monitoring inspections but will focus on whether safeguarding is now effective. If the school has resolved the safeguarding concerns, its overall grade is likely to improve."

        {
            "text": "Throughout the handbook, we have clarified what we mean when we refer to leaders in maintained schools and academies. For the purpose of inspection, leaders are those responsible for making decisions about how the school operates, including decisions relating to behaviour and the curriculum.\u00a0This always includes the headteacher and other senior staff. For an academy, it includes leaders at a trust level as well."
        },
        {
            "text": "Where a school is part of a trust, the board of trustees is legally responsible for governance. Inspectors must, in most cases, speak to the chair and other trustees as well as trust employees. This can be done face-to-face or on a video call. Who else inspectors meet with will depend on the trust the academy is part of and will be decided following a discussion with leaders."

            "text": "We have clarified who may participate in inspection activities, such as deep dives. For subject discussions, lesson visits and work scrutiny, middle leaders may be accompanied by a colleague, as long as this does not prevent them from participating fully in the discussion. Inspectors will also typically meet groups of pupils without school staff present, so that pupils can speak freely. There will also be the opportunity for staff to speak freely to inspectors without senior colleagues being in the room."

            "text": "As the school year starts, attendance is particularly important so that all pupils benefit from the education and experiences that school provides. We have included new sections setting out how inspectors will evaluate attendance and behaviour, while recognising that the context in which schools operate has changed since the pandemic. We understand that schools cannot be everything to everyone, but we expect schools to do all they reasonably can to improve attendance and behaviour. We will look at a school\u2019s capacity to improve and have defined what we mean by this."
