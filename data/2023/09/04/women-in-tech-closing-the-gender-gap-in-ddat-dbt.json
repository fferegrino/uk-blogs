The Digital, Data and Technology directorate (DDaT) in the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) aims to help close the gender gap by attracting and supporting women in the tech sector to develop their careers in DBT. With a majority female leadership team, DDaT is paving the way to diversifying the tech industry and closing the pay gap by supporting and developing women at all stages of their career in the industry."

I remember instantly feeling proud to be part of a department that showcases women in senior roles. Working in the tech profession has been a complete career change for me. Although I did not have previous tech experience, I have never felt disadvantaged. I feel well supported by my team and I am amazed at the wide range of learning and development opportunities offered within DDaT. Recently, I have been fortunate enough to deliver some great product adoption campaigns promoting the use of tech products created by DDaT. I am thankful to work in a department that prioritises self-development alongside career progression.\u2019"

To do this, DDaT focuses on leading by example by making our recruitment process and development offer inclusive to all. There is a misconception across the board that to join the digital, data and tech profession you already need to be a DDaT career professional. This often puts off diverse candidates. In DDaT DBT we make it clear to prospective colleagues that we welcome new joiners from all careers, walks of life and stages of their career. From those on apprenticeships and the Civil Service Fast Stream to those making a career change \u2013 we offer support and development opportunities to make DDaT a welcoming place to build and develop a career in tech."

We also ensure our roles are reaching a diverse audience, posting relevant vacancies to the Technojobs Women in Tech jobs board.

Whether formerly teachers, biochemists or librarians they\u2019ve made a choice for a different type of work and flourished here.
