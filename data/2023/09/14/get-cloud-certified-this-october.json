This is the most exciting month for those in the UK Public Sector to learn and achieve a Cloud certification as CDDO has secured free or discounted training, support classes and exam vouchers. If you\u2019ve already achieved a Cloud certification, why not aim for the next level of certification, or learn about services from a different Cloud provider?"
