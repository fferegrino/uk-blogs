            "text": "England\u2019s species are amazing. They can charm, intrigue, amaze, inspire and frighten us. They spark our interest and concern. They are also critical components and indicators of, healthy, thriving and resilient ecosystems on land, freshwater and at sea."

        {
            "text": "However, many of England\u2019s native species are threatened and in serious decline and need our help. Once common species have all but disappeared from England, for example the Duke of Burgundy butterfly has declined by some 50% over the last 20 years, limited now to isolated scattered colonies."

            "text": "In April 2023, we launched a new Species Recovery Programme Capital Grant Scheme. The scheme offers grants of up to half a million pounds to projects across England aiming to halt and reverse declines in populations of our most threatened species. Over 100 applications were received for projects targeting more than 200 species."

            "text": "Projects range in size from those covering several counties to bolster water vole populations across river catchments in East Anglia and the Midlands, to securing the future of species found on just one or two sites like the scarce Tufted-sedge in Hertfordshire."

        {
            "text": "The Species Recovery Programme Grant targets action to benefit species which often have very specialist life cycle requirements. For instance, the Pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly requires violets growing in short sparse vegetation for its caterpillars to feed on, funding through the grant scheme will ensure that the right habitat management is in place so that the violets remain and butterflies can thrive. \u00a0While some of our rarest plant species such as the Lady\u2019s Slipper orchid require specialist laboratory propagation to increase numbers and bolster the species population."

            "text": "The Species Recovery Grant scheme will fund all of the key elements that are needed to help restore populations of our rarest species.\u00a0The funding will help also create and restore the habitats across England that are essential for our native species, including lowland heathland, wetlands, streams, upland habitats, woodlands, scrubby flower rich and insect rich grasslands, wildlife ponds and linear habitats such as hedgerows."

            "text": "All of these projects will contribute to the government\u2019s goals of reducing the risk of species extinction by 2042 and increasing species abundance by 2030 and help put in place a Nature Recovery Network across England where wildlife can recover, move freely and thrive."
