In this blog, I want to update you on some of the work we\u2019ve been doing to support this focus, including:"

A high-quality early education is particularly beneficial for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and for children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)."

            "text": "Similarly, gaps in a child\u2019s early years education can have long-term consequences. Some children are more likely to have gaps than others. Overall, children from disadvantaged backgrounds lag behind other children by the end of the EYFS. Boys are furthest behind in their communication and language and this gender gap is widest for the most disadvantaged children."

It\u2019s difficult to recruit and retain staff. Fewer young people are enrolling on apprenticeships. Many children need a great deal of help to catch up after the pandemic."

We want to share this with the whole sector, supported by key messages from our research. This is why giving children \u2018the best start in life\u2019 is one of our strategic priorities and at the very heart of our work in the early years."

They are Mireille MacRaild HMI and Julian Grenier HMI. Both are highly experienced practitioners in early education with many years of leadership expertise. They have a wealth of first-hand experience of working with babies, toddlers and young children in the EYFS, and of leading professional development for practitioners. Both colleagues have already made a substantial contribution to our early years work. We look forward to using their expertise even further in 2023/24."
