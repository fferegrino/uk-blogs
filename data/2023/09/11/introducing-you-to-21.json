The Research and Insight Network Group started just over a year ago and it\u2019s a very busy environment to work in.\u00a0 No two days are the same \u2013 I can be having an in-depth telephone conversation, testing a survey before release, analysing results, facilitating one-to-one interviews, or running focus groups."

            "text": "I like to think that my interaction with customers is seen as positive. If I\u2019m speaking with an arable farmer, I would readily admit I know very little about arable farming, although I do know a lot more about cattle and sheep!"

            "text": "We\u2019re first generation livestock farmers. We started farming in 1985 and using a very small inheritance, bought an old tractor with a loader and a tup, and began our lives as UK tenant farmers. Over time we grew from having just one in-calf heifer, and two pet ewes, to milking one of the largest flocks of sheep in the country."

            "text": "Robin and I know first-hand the enormous struggle of trying to get onto that first rung of the farming ladder and stay there!\u00a0 It is a massive undertaking, not just financially, but physically and emotionally too. We\u2019ve had our share of heartbreaks, from having to sell up our first venture, to losing our first animal to Bovine Tuberculosis in 2008.\u00a0 But despite it all, we\u2019re still standing, still in business, and for that we\u2019re proud and thankful."

I helped set up the call centre, fronting initial calls from farmers, working closely with vets, and supporting the animal movement licencing department."

Also, realising and genuinely knowing the challenges that our customers are facing. When you receive comments such as \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to talk to someone who knows about farming \u2013 it made our conversation a lot easier and quicker,\u201d makes for happy feelings!"

What\u2019s so amazing about our workshops and telephone interviews, is that they allow farmers to come to us and discuss matters with us openly and honestly, and on neutral ground; something I have always believed is absolutely vital."

            "text": "My proudest moments in RPA have always been whenever I\u2019m able to help make things better for a fellow farmer. It\u2019s the most important part of my job - and whether I\u2019m working on a customer survey, advising Defra\u2019s Companion Animal Welfare Policy team, or providing feedback to the Livestock Information Service, I never lose of sight of this."

            "text": "Native species are a passion for myself and my husband, and in 2016 we started to show our (now award-winning) Welsh Blacks; a steep learning curve but a very enjoyable one. Our Suffolk x Lleyn lambs also do well in carcase competitions, and this means the world to us because if native livestock disappear, they will never return."

            "text": "We have two daughters, who \u2013 although they both grew up on the farm \u2013 show zero interest in following our in our farming footsteps (traitors!) but at least the grandchildren love riding on the quad and \u201cdriving\u201d the mini-digger! I still ride my own horse regularly, but no longer compete."

            "text": "I truly believe that together we can make a difference.\u00a0 Certainly, the way forward for agriculture brings its own challenges and opportunities, but if RPA can work together with the UK rural industry to make things better, I will retire a very happy lady - albeit not for the foreseeable future!"
