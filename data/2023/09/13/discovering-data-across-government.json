It will provide a front door to discover, access and share government data in a legal, ethical and trusted way, also offering supporting guidance and tools to help data sharing across government."

Our user research has uncovered it can be difficult to find out what data is held by other parts of government and it is unclear whether, and how, this can be accessed easily and in a legally compliant way.\u00a0"

We must ensure we strike the right balance between requiring data to drive and improve services for citizens, while also using this data responsibly. Procedures exist to do this at a departmental level, however if we offer this current good practice as a single, consistent approach, we drive efficiency, transparency and set expectations of requirements.\u00a0\u00a0"
