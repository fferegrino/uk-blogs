Vital for biodiversity and nature recovery, they also provide valuable ecosystem services such as delivering sustainable wood products, capturing carbon, helping to regulate the flow of water through our landscapes, and creating the perfect place for recreation and access to nature. However, for England\u2019s woodlands to flourish, it\u2019s up to us to ensure they are nurtured and in good condition. In this blog I\u2019ll be exploring the different threats facing our woodlands, and how woodland management can help ensure good future health and resilience."

            "text": "Over past decades we have seen a decline in the condition of our woodlands and an associated decline in woodland biodiversity. Our woodlands can lack a diversity of structure, often not providing the vital deadwood and open spaces woodland wildlife depends upon. Dark, closed canopy woodlands can suppress the woodland understory and ground flora which prevents natural regeneration \u2013 integral to ensuring the next generation of hardy and resilient trees. Deer and other mammals can have a severe negative impact on ground flora found throughout our woodlands, and in many cases, browsing mammal damage is the biggest challenge to ensuring healthy, regenerating and biodiverse woodlands."

            "text": "The presence of pests and invasive species such as grey squirrels and rhododendron can have a negative impact on the condition of our woodlands. Grey squirrels strip the bark on broadleaved trees, severely damaging them so they are more susceptible to disease, and they can make trees grown for timber useless. Rhododendron suppresses native plants and can host diseases such as Phytophthora ramorum, which can infect and kill trees. With international trade and changing climate conditions, it is likely that we will see an increase in threats from pests, diseases and invasive species in the future."

        {
            "text": "The environment in which our woodlands and trees grow is changing rapidly. Climate change is happening at such a rate that it is difficult for trees to adapt to changing climatic conditions in rainfall and temperature. This may result in unsuitable growing conditions for some species on certain soil types, and specific climate conditions found across different parts of the country. Climate change also increases the chance of severe weather events such as storms, droughts and wildfire, which can put extra pressure on our woodlands."

            "text": "The good news is that there is plenty we can do to make our woodlands more resilient to these threats. A well informed and planned approach to managing your woodland allows you to identify the main threats while considering what objectives you would like to prioritise \u2013 such as timber production, supporting biodiversity or recreation. From this, you can develop a course of action which best supports your woodland objectives in the face of the threats posed, and ensures your woodland continues to deliver those all-important ecosystem services."

            "text": "The best way to get your thoughts together, and to develop the most appropriate plan for your woodland, is by creating a woodland management plan. The Forestry Commission has a template you can follow, which ensures your woodland management activity meets the UK Forestry Standard \u2013 enabling you to apply for future felling licences and financial support. If you have any questions about how to start the process, speak to your local Forestry Commission Woodland Officer who will be only too happy to help."
