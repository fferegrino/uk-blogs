They're vital because they allow us designers, as well as key stakeholders (for example, user researchers, product managers and developers) to evaluate the proposed designs of our services and decide if they're fit for purpose."

            "text": "We know we\u2019re extremely unlikely to get the designs right first time. We\u2019ll fail and fail often. But by working with fellow designers, stakeholders, and users, we can identify potential problems, gather crucial feedback, and make iterative design improvements long before the \u2018final\u2019, real service is built."

And we will fail all the way. This is a key principle of prototyping though - fail early and fail often! For example, users might not understand something because we\u2019ve not made our designs intuitive enough, or we may have designed something that's not technically achievable in a limited timeframe."

Let\u2019s say for example, we put a critical page of the journey in completely the wrong section, meaning a significant number of users could not complete a filing. We\u2019d have to spend more money and time fixing the issue, possibly having to take the service offline. There\u2019d be reputational impact, and an increase in customer contact \u2013 all things we want to avoid of course."
