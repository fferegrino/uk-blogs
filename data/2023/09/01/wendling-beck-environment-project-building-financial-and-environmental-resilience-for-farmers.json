Wendling Beck is a partnership project between landowners, local authorities, environmental charities and Anglian Water."

The project expects to see total revenues between \u00a360 - \u00a390 Million over a minimum of 30 years and will create 1000 acres of species-rich grassland, 200 acres of lowland heath, 135 acres of floodplain restoration, 240 acres of woodland, 50km of new hedgerows and 5km of river restoration."

            "text": "To access payments for these new ecosystems the project has extensively measured the baseline condition of natural capital to be able to quantitively demonstrate the improvements being made. The ability to predict and subsequently verify these improvements enables the project to access new ecosystem service markets related to biodiversity net gain (BNG), and carbon credits."

        {
            "text": "We worked with Wendling Beck to help develop the legal, governance and financial structures through designing an operating company that enabled the landowners to work together to facilitate ecosystem service transactions and distribution of the revenue generated. This revenue, alongside payments from the new Environmental Land Management (ELMs) scheme and more traditional farm income has made improving the natural environment a viable approach."

            "text": "The project demonstrates a step-change in how nature-friendly, low-carbon agricultural practices can enhance revenue for existing farm businesses over the next 30 years. The finance model accounts for revenue from ecosystem services but also the regenerative production of blackcurrants, a new livestock enterprise and farm shop, demonstrating that nature-positive practices need not sacrifice food production."

The project will help species that have declined and disappeared over time recover, restore habitats to support native species such as turtle dove and help reverse biodiversity loss."

From 2020 to 2022, nitrogen and chemical inputs were halved and synthetic phosphate application has stopped. Importantly, this is an exemplar project, and will demonstrate how other landowners can take similar nature-positive, net-zero measures whilst diversifying income streams by leveraging private finance."

A new cycle path allows all ability access, whilst a planned learning centre and environmental hub will support young people to learn about nature. The project will also help build resilience to local flooding."

It demonstrates how nature-positive farm subsidies (ELMs), compliance markets such as BNG and carbon credits, and voluntary markets such as carbon, can be used by landowners to benefit nature and continue to be financially viable."
