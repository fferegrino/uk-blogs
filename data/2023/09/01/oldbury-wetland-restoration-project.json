However, silt from the river could accumulate in front of the cooling water inlets, risking blocking them. To ensure the unimpeded flow of cooling water into the site this silt was periodically dredged and deposited on land into three lagoons."

High-tide roosts are important for the conservation of water birds, providing areas for \u2018loafing\u2019 and energy conservation at periods of high tide. \u00a0A good high-tide roost should be close to the estuary, safe from predation and be large enough for communal flocking."

To re-create the high-tide roost, areas of standing water or wet silt would need to be created, and on-going management of the site would be required. If we do not regenerate the Lagoon three wetland habitat, it will naturally deteriorate into scrubland/woodland and will cease to be the valuable wetland habitat that it once was."

However, the UK has lost 75% of its wetlands since the industrial revolution. The Government\u2019s 25-year environment plan includes restoring 500,00 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat outside the protected site network focussing on priority habitat. The west of England aims to create 5,108 hectares of wildlife rich habitat outside of the existing protected sites."
