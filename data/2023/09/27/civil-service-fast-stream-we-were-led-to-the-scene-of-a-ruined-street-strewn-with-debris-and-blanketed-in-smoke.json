Each of these variants have different specifications depending on the defence requirement. Prime Contractor, General Dynamics will be delivering 589 vehicles to the British Army. The vehicles have a lifespan of at least 35 years, meaning they have the best-in-class protection and survivability, reliability and mobility, and all-weather intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and recognition (ISTAR). They can operate in combined-arms and multi-national situations, across a wide-range of future operating environments.\u00a0"

This has allowed similar variants to be built more efficiently. We saw the schedules for each vehicle on site and learnt about the wide range of requirements that each design had to meet. We finished our day with a visit to the vehicle test track, where the AJAX vehicles are tried and tested before being released to the British Army.\u00a0"

The projects discussed included the Naval Support Integrated Global Network, which is responsible for the re-provision of services contracted through the Future Maritime Support Programme. We also met the programme director for the Maritime Electronic Warfare Programme, who explained that the programme will deliver anti-ship missile capabilities and the necessary protection, through automated coordination of response to missile attacks. This was followed by an insight into Type 31 from its programme manager. This is a general purpose frigate programme that will be at the heart of the Royal Navy\u2019s surface fleet, deterring aggression and maintaining the UK security and interests."

They highlighted the British decision to send 14 Challengers, which then prompted other allies to provide their tanks in support of Ukraine. We then entered a marquee, and were given a demonstration of a simulated precision strike - showing Britain leading the way in modern warfare."

We have been privileged to learn about, first-hand, the unique circumstances and key challenges of major project delivery across the Royal Navy and British Army, and learnt from senior leaders and IPA advisors about the key skills - at an individual, team and project or programme level - for project delivery success. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience so early on in our careers, and we look forward to taking these learnings forward into other major projects and programmes across government.\u00a0"
