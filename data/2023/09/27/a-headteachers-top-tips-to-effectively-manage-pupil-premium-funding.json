            "text": "Maximising school budgets and making sure we get the most possible from our Pupil Premium funding can be a daunting task. The Pupil Premium Grant (PPG) states the funding should be spent for the benefit of the pupils and must\u00a0be spent on activities that support the quality of teaching, provide targeted academic support, and tackle non-academic barriers to success. However, with the numbers of pupils in my school entitled to PPG and those with SEND far higher than the national average, how do we prioritise the funding?"

            "text": "As a reminder, many use the term \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 to talk about those who have faced inequity and as a result, experienced unequal opportunity. It\u2019s important to remain mindful \u00a0when using labels, particularly with children, and work hard to accurately identify and address individual needs rather than making assumptions."

            "text": "Sometimes it\u2019s easy to focus on the challenges for the school rather than those faced individually by the pupils. Take reading for example. Often the challenge stated is that parents/ carers do not read regularly with their children. \u00a0If outcomes for reading at the end of KS2 demonstrate that pupils are not adequately prepared for their next stage in education, it\u2019s important that leaders think carefully at what more the school can do for their pupils and what is in their control. The challenge or problem must be explored in detail, this is where the EEF\u2019s Putting Evidence to Work \u2013 a School\u2019s Guide to Implementation guidance report provides helpful guidance about ensuring approaches \u00a0chosen in your school meet the actual problem not the perceived one."

For my junior school, this meant knowing that a higher-than-average number of children are likely to have experienced 4 or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and had many of the vulnerabilities listed in Keeping Children Safe in Education 2022. Elements of the EEF\u2019s Improving Social and Emotional Learning in Primary Schools guidance report could be used to help provide protective factors for children with vulnerabilities but also support children who have not experienced them."

            "text": "The EEF Teaching and Learning Toolkit states that a social and emotional learning (SEL) approach to a whole school emotional regulation framework could be implemented at \u00a0a low cost and could yield 4 months\u2019 progress. Funding at our school or schools? was then used for universal programmes on \u00a0developing, resilience, empathy, communication, and teamwork amongst other things."
