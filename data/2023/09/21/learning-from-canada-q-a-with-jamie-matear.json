            "text": "My title is Director of Siting Coordination. It's a multiple pronged role that has touch points with engaging community leaders, working with the communities on funding programs, sponsorships and donations, annual engagement and reporting. We have a requirement to manage stakeholder engagement records, and ultimately will be having to provide that to the regulator to show that we've engaged with our communities. \u00a0I'm also responsible for preparing what's called our final decision document, which is summarising everything that we've done up to making the decision which is expected in 2024."

He's a proponent of what nuclear brings to society as a safe and non-carbon generating energy source. I recognised this project would be a great opportunity and project to be involved with, and to do something responsible with Canada\u2019s used nuclear fuel."

We had 22 communities express an interest in potentially hosting a GDF and we've narrowed down through technical and social research, \u00a0to the final two siting areas. We expect to be making a decision on which of the two sites would continue by the end of 2024."

Federal legislation that said the nuclear industry had to establish an organisation to create a plan to manage Canada's used nuclear fuel."

            "text": "In the early days there was a study period. And through the study period, we asked Canadians what's important, and they told us. Safety first and foremost, and that our generation should deal with the issue. We created a plan which recommended a GDF and took that to the federal government. In 2007, they said they liked our plan and we implemented it.\u00a0 We developed something called the \u2018site selection process\u2019, which is a volunteer process by which Canadian municipalities and Indigenous communities could come forward and express an interest in learning about the process to potentially be a repository host."

            "text": "This process started in 2010, and between 2010 and 2012, not knowing how many communities were going to put up their hands, we had 23 communities express initial interest. From this group, 22 of the communities advanced into preliminary site investigations."

These included looking at the community\u2019s current and long-term vision and their potential willingness and how neighbouring communities viewed the project. We also reviewed a lot of technical information including geology, the safety case and the ability to build a facility on site. We've now narrowed down to the two final areas."

For example, a community referendum or vote. A lot of effort is required to develop and communicate this process within our remaining communities."

For context, we only drilled two in the south because of the homogeneity of the sedimentary rock there. We were able to use results from other boreholes that had been drilled throughout the area to help with the evaluation at the site."

We're currently doing environmental baseline studies."

This includes the used fuel container \u201ca UFC\u201d , a steel and copper container for used fuel placed within a bentonite clay box emplaced in the host rock - that's our multi barrier system. It was quite a milestone for us."

This is when we take our project to the impact assessment Agency of Canada, where they'll do an environmental impact assessment. We then go to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission who will provide us with the approval for our licenses to prepare the site and then a license to construct a site. The initial impact assessment process should take five years or so years to complete with licensing to follow."

        {
            "text": "With our permissions we hope to begin construction in the early 2030s. It will take about ten years to construct the facility to such a point where we could actually start to bring in the used fuel from where it's currently located. It then takes about 40 years after that to fill the repository. After the facility is filled, we will move to long-term monitoring and eventually decommission the site. In total, the conception of the project is approximately 170 years in length."
