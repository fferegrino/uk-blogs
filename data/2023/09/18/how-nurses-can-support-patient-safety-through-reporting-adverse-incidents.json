            "text": "On World Patient Safety Day, Holly Coole, registered mental health nurse and senior manager for digital mental health at the MHRA, discusses how the safety of medical products is monitored and how all nurses can help ensure potential issues are picked up fast through the UK\u2019s Yellow Card scheme."

            "text": "As a nurse, I always endeavoured to keep myself informed about the medicines and devices I used with patients but understood very little about the process that put them in front of me or monitored their safety once they were on the market.\u00a0 I trusted they were safe and effective but never thought about how this was ensured or how I could help."
        },

            "text": "I\u2019ve spent the last few years working as a benefit risk assessor at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the body that regulates medicines, medical devices and healthcare products in the UK, initially reviewing the post-market surveillance for medical devices and more recently leading a project on digital mental health regulation.\u00a0 This turn in my career has allowed me to learn exactly how patient safety is supported in the UK."
        },
        {
            "text": "All medicines and medical devices have to go through a robust safety assessment before they are approved for use in the UK, with manufacturers having to provide not just clinical trial and safety studies to support their claims for safety and efficacy but also open for inspections of their manufacturing facilities and distribution networks, to ensure that every single step of the supply chain is protected for patients."
        },
        {
            "text": "Once products are on the market, though, this work doesn\u2019t stop as ongoing monitoring is crucial in ensuring they remain safe.\u00a0 There are many factors that can impact this. Manufacturing processes can change, long-term effects on both patient health and product resilience can become evident, and effects on under-represented demographic populations in safety studies can be seen once the product reaches a wider population, amongst others."
        },
        {
            "text": "At the MHRA, we conduct extensive post-market surveillance which brings information in from a wide range of sources so that we can identify potential safety signals with medicines and devices, evaluate the benefit risk impact and then develop risk minimisation measures, preferably in collaboration with manufacturers and market authorisation holders, to maintain the safe use of healthcare products."
        },
        {
            "text": "Manufacturers are required to maintain a continuous feedback loop on safety and efficacy evidence once their product is licensed in the UK, and they have to report this data to the MHRA if safety concerns become evident.\u00a0 We can also use information from other sources such as new post-market safety studies, other regulatory bodies, anonymised data from electronic healthcare records, whistle-blowers and, most importantly, reports from our Yellow Card scheme."

            "text": "The Yellow Card scheme is the MHRA\u2019s flagship system for collecting information on safety concerns, including suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving medicines, vaccines and medical devices.\u00a0 Set up in 1964, it forms a critical part of the well-established systems and procedures in place for vigilance in the UK."
        },
        {
            "text": "The scheme relies on voluntary reporting from patients and healthcare professionals like you, receiving and processing almost 100k reports relating to medicines and devices a year.\u00a0 This is crucial in helping to provide an early warning that the safety of a healthcare product may require further investigation.\u00a0 In turn, this helps us to identify potential signals that were previously unknown before being reported."
        },
        {
            "text": "Every single Yellow Card report submitted to us is analysed by experts, including doctors, pharmacists, scientists, medical device specialists and nurses, like myself.\u00a0 When we combine them with all the other sources of data, like those above, it helps us to determine what events may be a potential signal and what may have occurred anyway, in the absence of the medical intervention."
        },
        {
            "text": "This is significant because to report a Yellow Card, you only need to suspect a potential link between the product and the event, but sometimes further investigation shows that the issue being reported is not due to the medicine or medical device in question."
        },
        {
            "text": "This is why it is so important to report.\u00a0 I know from experience that nurses are in a fantastic position to advocate for the safety and efficacy of medicines and medical devices as you are most likely to be administering medications, using medical devices and monitoring for side effects."
        },
        {
            "text": "While I know that nursing comes with a heavy load of mandatory reports, should an adverse event or reaction occur, it\u2019s really important that the information is shared with us, so we can build a picture of emerging trends that can then be pro-actively managed. \u00a0\u00a0By doing so, you are directly helping to keep your patients safe."

        {
            "text": "To make things smoother, you could add the Yellow Card app or website into your incident reporting tools on the wards, so it becomes part of the process you use each time."
