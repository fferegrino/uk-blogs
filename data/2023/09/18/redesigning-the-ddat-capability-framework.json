In parallel, the team worked on a prototype built from the GOV.UK Prototype Kit and GOV.UK Design System components with accessibility requirements at heart. We tested it with digital, data & technology professionals, which is our main user group, but also with people designing capability interventions for digital, data & technology professionals. Six rounds of research enabled us to thoroughly understand our users, their journeys and the tasks they were trying to achieve with the framework while designing a Minimal Viable Product that would work on both laptops and mobile devices. We know from our user research that almost a quarter of our users access the framework while using a mobile device.\u00a0"

It's also why we believe a robust cross-government consultation process is essential to source the latest roles and skills evolutions in the civil service. We enabled this by creating the Capability Framework Design Council and adopting clear governance principles for managing changes."

We now follow a quarterly cadence to publish changes, all of them are tracked in the update section of our product."

This is something we are still working on but it helps us to better understand how skills can be shared between roles. We are undertaking a major rewrite to harmonise skills descriptions where we can while removing inconsistencies. This is really exciting as it opens up career pathways in a much clearer way!"
