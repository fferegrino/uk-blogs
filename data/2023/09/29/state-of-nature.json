            "text": "Yesterday saw the publication of the fourth State of Nature (SON) Report, the product of a collaboration of environmental NGOs, academic institutions and government agencies, including Natural England. The report provides the most comprehensive overview ever of species trends across the UK, including specific assessments for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and for the UK\u2019s Overseas Territories. Its conclusions are based on millions of records collected by thousands of volunteer \u2018citizen scientists\u2019 spanning terrestrial, freshwater and marine species."

        {
            "text": "The report makes compelling reading. It lays bare the stark fact that nature is still seriously declining across the UK, a country that is already one of the most nature-depleted in the world. The data show that since 1970 UK species have declined by about 19% on average, and nearly 1 in 6 species (16.1%) are now threatened with extinction. This is a timely reminder, if we needed it, that the nature crisis isn\u2019t restricted to far-off places like the Amazon or Great Barrier Reef. It is right here, on our doorstep. We are losing familiar wildlife that we cherish including the hazel dormouse and skylark."

        {
            "text": "Beyond the troubling headlines of nature loss provided by the report, the evidence in the report also provides glimmers of hope. Although many species are in decline, there is also a significant number that are increasing. For example, while our pollinating insects are declining overall, some groups of freshwater insects such as dragonflies are faring better. Similarly, although most mammals are declining, many bat species are on the increase."

To quote the report, \u201cWe have never had a better understanding of the State of Nature and what is needed to fix it.\u201d"

People must also have the chance to be part of these changes, and more people deserve to experience the joy of connecting with abundant nature \u2013 or indeed any nature."

We are also considering further places suitable to become sites of scientific interest, and we will establish another 25 National Nature Reserves by 2027."

This will comprise a network of wildlife rich places that also provides nature\u2019s critical benefits to people, stretching across England from our cities to countryside, mountain to sea. Scale matters, and landscape-scale Nature Recovery Projects (NRPs) will make a major contribution to the NRN. In July 2023 an area bigger than Hertfordshire was dedicated to fast tracking nature recovery as six new NRPs were launched by Natural England and the government, working with partners to deliver. The projects, will help to manage flooding and wildfire risks, improve carbon stores and build diverse habitats for wildlife."

In September, 63 projects were awarded grants totalling \u00a314.5m. With these grants, 74 different organisations will be working to help restore populations of rare species including the critically endangered European eel, Greater Mouse-eared bat, Sand lizard, Atlantic salmon, Eurasian curlew, Pasqueflower, Grizzled skipper and Northern lapwing."

So we owe it to nature, and ourselves, to make sure that it is the last State of Nature report to chart continuing decline. I very much hope that everyone can take something from this report that will enable them to do their bit for nature recovery, and ensure that the next report can document the start of nature bouncing back."
