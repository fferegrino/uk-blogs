It is important to note that to date only a small number of cases have been identified across the world, and we will need more data to draw any conclusions about the effect of these mutations on transmissibility and severity of the variant. In this blog post we\u2019ll outline what we know so far and what action we are taking."

As more data becomes available on this variant, we\u2019ll have a better understanding of how it interacts with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection and as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible."

That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking over-65s, anyone in a clinical risk group, and anyone living in a household with someone who is in a clinical risk group, to come forward for their vaccination. Their protection since their last vaccination will have waned and they remain at increased risk from a respiratory infection this winter. It\u2019s also important to note that COVID-19 isn\u2019t a special case; respiratory infections can be unpredictable, and we\u2019re asking similar groups to get vaccinated against flu."

It can take a few weeks for protection to build after a vaccine, so getting vaccinated ahead of the winter season, when respiratory viruses tend to peak, is important."

If you\u2019re eligible for the jabs, please don\u2019t hesitate, book your vaccine and get winter strong."
