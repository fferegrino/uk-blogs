The Prevent duty requires specified authorities to help prevent the risk of people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. As the threat of radicalisation evolves, we have updated our training for frontline professionals to help equip them with the skills and knowledge to spot the signs of radicalisation and make a referral where appropriate. Prevent duty guidance was published in September 2023 and more information is available on the factsheet."
