            "text": "Salmon are a keystone species and an iconic indicator of a healthy, clean environment and highly valued by the general public and by those who fish for them. Every year, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales report on the state of our salmon stock levels, to help determine any actions that need to be taken to protect this species. The latest Salmon Stock Assessment for 2022 shows that Wild Atlantic salmon stocks remain a cause for concern in England, with results showing a marginal improvement from last year."

            "text": "There are many factors impacting salmon both within freshwater and the marine environment. Our changing climate is resulting in significant changes in the marine environment as well as driving warmer winter river temperatures. Other pressures come from marine and coastal fisheries exploitation, barriers to the free movement of salmon through our river systems and the habitat and water quality and flow in our rivers and estuaries which are all vital to salmon throughout their lifecycle."

            "text": "The Environment Agency remains committed to improving the future outcomes for our salmon, actively working to update and develop a new salmon implementation plan for England. We are engaging with NGOs, angling organisations and other key stakeholders and interested parties to develop this, taking into account all of the pressures facing salmon. Work is also taking place to improve water quality and reduce the exploitation of salmon by both net and rod fisheries. What is clear is that the EA cannot achieve all of the required actions in isolation and collaborative working is at the heart of efforts to improve conditions in both freshwater and the marine environment for the benefit of saving salmon for future generations."

In 2019 we implemented the closure of salmon net fisheries in England until at least 2029, and the anglers we work alongside have delivered an overall catch and release rate in rod fisheries of 95% through both voluntary and mandatory controls. The current stock assessments suggest that many rivers in England should have minimal exploitation of salmon and the EA is actively considering options to maximise future adult salmon spawning success.

In the last year, the EA has improved numerous fish passes at weirs or barriers across English rivers giving salmon better access to spawning grounds. A new 200m fish pass at Colwick on the River Trent is also due to be completed later this year, which will become the country\u2019s largest fish pass restoring miles of river and aiding migration. "

In 2022, we completed 137 schemes that will bring benefits to salmon. 73 of these were on our Principal Salmon Rivers and 64 on recovering salmon rivers. The schemes were predominantly to investigate the impact of water quality, flow and physical modification pressures. In 2023, there are 21 investigation and improvement schemes scheduled on both Principal Salmon Rivers and recovering salmon rivers.\u00a0\u00a0"
