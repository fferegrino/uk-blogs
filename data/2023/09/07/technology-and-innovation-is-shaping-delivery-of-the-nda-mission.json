She studied chemistry to PhD level in the UK and Germany and some of her other achievements include being a visiting professor at University of Leeds, international advisor to IRID (International Institute for Decommissioning in Japan), and a non-executive director on the Board for Nuclear Waste Services. Melanie is also a Member of the UKAEA Programme Advisory Committee and the UK Fusion Technical Advisory Group. In 2020, she was named by Women in Nuclear as \u2018Champion of the Year\u2019."
