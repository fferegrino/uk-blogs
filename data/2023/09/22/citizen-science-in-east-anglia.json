My title and main role is Citizen Science Monitoring Coordinator in East Anglia, which involves helping citizen scientists collect good quality accessible data and exploring how the Environment Agency can then use this data. Citizen Science is scientific monitoring and research conducted by members of the public - at the Environment Agency we\u2019re part of many initiatives that support this type of science."

I work with volunteers on these schemes, who tend to be members of the public with\u00a0 an interest in the health of the river as well as Rivers Trust or other charity employees. The best way to get involved is generally through your local catchment partnership, a local rivers charity or the local part of a bigger charity such as a local Rivers Trust, Rivercare or a Wildlife Trust."

Volunteers collect a sample in the river and then analyse it on the riverbank looking for mayfly, stonefly, caddisfly, freshwater shrimp and more, before releasing their catch. The number of species we find is a helpful indicator on the health of the river and following further investigation enables us to detect pollution or drought impacts."

Riverfly samples have helped identify droughts and the effects of drought and help to warn us about possible pollution incidents. Citizen scientists monitoring water quality have also found signs of pollution, which we have investigated and verified and are working collaboratively to resolve."
