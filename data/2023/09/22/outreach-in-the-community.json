Each member is helping to generate more science-related communications material for use on social media and at science and careers events at schools, colleges and universities and other community events. We are also planning to expand our STEM Ambassadors to include technology, engineering and maths through the SCAH programme, which is a 10-15 year major infrastructure construction programme."

It was not easy, but with a little help from their parents and APHA staff they all had a go and guessed most of them correctly. The fluffy pig bugs and sweet prizes were a good incentive!"

STEM ambassadors from the Tuberculosis (TB) and Virology team talked about their scientific work and encouraged students to consider apprenticeships as an alternative to pursuing degree courses. The fair featured a strong representation from universities and some other local employers."

There will be a two-hour programme of science displays and tours, for a group of up to 40 sixth form college or technical college students, with an interest in learning more about working on animal health research and diagnosis or in supporting roles, such as scientific project management. There will also be chance to speak to our scientists about their career pathway and our HR team about job and further study/training opportunities, including apprenticeships."
