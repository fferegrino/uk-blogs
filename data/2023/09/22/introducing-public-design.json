There\u2019s a serious issue that belies this tongue-in-cheek slice of life: we lack a well-understood proposition for design."

            "text": "This is our fault \u2013 the fault of designers \u2013 there are so many explanations for design from each branch of the design family that it acts to confuse people. Our different explanations of design make sense to designers. But to others, this crazy paving approach to our value proposition looks \u2013 well, just crazy. The absence of a common proposition divides rather than unites the design family, and it is the number one barrier to bootstrapping design in governments. We need a universal definition and proposition for design in the language of governments and ministries of finance."

This is often based on what we make and where we work in the policy-to-delivery pipeline (like transactional services, or strategic policy, or communication). While there are differences in how we work, what we have in common is far more powerful: the practice of design fundamentals about how to make things that deliver public value."

The UK\u2019s Public Value Framework, Scotland\u2019s National Performance Framework, Wales\u2019 Future Generations Act, the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals: all seek to expand the definition of public value."

This can be truly transformational for public policies and services. But from the perspective of senior public leaders and ministries of finance it\u2019s simply not enough. They are making trade-offs between:"

            "text": "Civil services everywhere tend to be: brilliant at understanding intent (there is substantial bureaucratic machinery surrounding ministers to enact their ambitions); middling at understanding systems (systems are usually organised, especially social ones, so officials can get to grips with them and often do); and poor at understanding people (because they are unorganised, so very difficult for officials to engage with)."

            "text": "Designers have been incredibly successful at plugging that gap with user-centred design. But if we are going to renew our contract with governments, we need to ensure our definition of design reflects the world as governments see it. That means designers continuing to be brilliant at user-centred design, but it also requires a deliberate focus on crystallising and responding to intent, and being systems thinkers to respond to complex environments."

This is an incredibly important job in the increasingly complex and turbulent world that we live in. A smaller, but no less important, part of the work is making and re-making public policies and services \u2013 and this is where design experts can help."

You would expect everyone in your team to have basic research skills \u2013 to be able to go onto the internet to find information and make sense of it. But when the research task is too big or difficult to undertake alone, you bring in an expert researcher. Design should be no different. It is a technical practice and a core function of public institutions. It should have the same status as research."

            "text": "The question of where and how a design function is embedded in governments is a question for another day.

            "text": "Design is about making things better, but it also serves a mechanism for governments to systematically reduce uncertainty about whether their investments will have the expected effect and deliver public value. A world with less design creates long-term design debt and at worst puts lives at risk."

On the public value side we have HM Treasury\u2019s public spending experts, with government\u2019s independent National Audit Office acting as a critical friend. Experts in public design and value from civil society (Nesta, Royal Society of Arts, Joseph Rowntree Foundation) and universities (Central Saint Martins, UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University of Manchester) have also joined the team. All supported by co-parent professions: Policy Profession, Operational Delivery Profession, and Digital, Data and Technology Profession."

We will be reaching out to all public designers in the UK whether you work in central or local government, or other public organisations. We\u2019ll do this during the Autumn through professional communities and networks, and the Design Council, to understand how public design drives public value and your experience of doing this work. I hope to you can play your part in this extraordinary alliance."
