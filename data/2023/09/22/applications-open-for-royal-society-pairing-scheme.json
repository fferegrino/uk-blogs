Each year 30 research scientists and engineers are paired with UK parliamentarians and civil servants for one week. The scheme aims to upskill policy makers on how best to work with scientists outside of government, and how to engage with academia more broadly. Next year, the scheme will be taking place between 18 and 21 March 2024.\u00a0"
