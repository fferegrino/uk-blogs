            "text": "However, behind the scenes, GOV.UK is made up of many applications that work together to produce the public-facing website. Between these applications and the computer hardware that runs them, there is system software that acts as a go-between. We sometimes call this system software the \"platform\" on which GOV.UK runs."

This blog post describes how we decided what to do, how we did it and ultimately how we made GOV.UK more secure, cheaper to run and easier to scale. By doing this, we directly contributed to GDS\u2019s mission \u201cto make digital government simpler, clearer and faster for everyone\u201d."

From 2014 to 2023, our OS was Ubuntu, and we managed our configuration with Puppet."

        {
            "text": "By 2021, this infrastructure software was approaching the end of its supportable lifespan. Though we still have commercial support in place, running an old operating system meant we were spending ever more engineering effort working around compatibility issues whenever we needed to update other software that GOV.UK depends on, such as Ruby-on-Rails."

            "text": "We considered whether to upgrade to recent versions of Ubuntu and Puppet (running on virtual machines), or to take the opportunity to modernise by running GOV.UK in containers."
        },
        {
            "text": "For GOV.UK, the main advantages of containers are scalability and lower maintenance. We were using complex automation to deploy many different applications onto the same set of virtual machines, which made it difficult to add more machines (\"scaling up\") in response to increased website traffic. We were also spending a lot of engineering time updating the software on these virtual machines."

            "text": "Moving to containers means that when we need to respond to surges of traffic, we can add capacity easily. During our work on COVID-19, we saw how important it was to be able to withstand these traffic spikes."

            "text": "One of our engineers suggested a bold idea which would prove a catalyst for the project's success: what if we were to perform a trial-run on the real, live website? At first this sounds like an unnecessary risk: why not wait until the whole system is fully working in a test environment?"

            "text": "During our trial runs, we solved problems as a team by mobbing on them. Mob programming as a team further helped build trust and confidence for individuals. By working through minor issues together as a team in a safe environment, it increased people\u2019s ability to experiment with different solutions to solve problems."

We reviewed our run book and roll back plans to ensure they were accurate and up to date. We made a list of useful contacts such as technical support and escalation contacts. We informed publishers and other stakeholders, allowing them time to ask questions."
