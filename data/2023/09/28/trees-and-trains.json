            "text": "You may not always associate Network Rail with trees. However, we own and manage six million on our property. In addition, over the last three years we have also funded the planting of around 250,000 trees with The Tree Council . With our money they have been able to work with over 150 communities to plant tree and hedgerow habitats that will benefit those communities."

            "text": "Earlier this year, the government legislated a statutory tree and woodland target to increase tree canopy and woodland cover of England to 16.5% by 2050. My knowledge of forestry and the interactions we have with our seven million neighbours brought it home that when these trees were planted, we needed to make sure once they have matured they didn't pose a risk to the railway."

            "text": "Conversations with the Forestry Commission showed that we could make use of data we had available to identify habitats next to the railway. This data could be overlaid with several factors that could be reasons why, or why not, to plant trees in a certain location. These could include peat soils or high-quality agricultural land as places not to plant or conversely closeness to local communities and ancient woodland as reasons to plant."

            "text": "The data covers over three million hectares of land and we have been able to identify 600,000 hectares in England alone where there could be an opportunity to grow trees. The data we have suggests that the land within one kilometre of the railway has actually quite low woodland cover... in the region of 10%."

            "text": "The conference will look at the feasibility work we did with the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. This looked at how best to incentivise landowners and plan for appropriate planting and included the development of a digital woodland suitability mapping tool. The tool draws on layers of geographic information to identify influencers for woodland planting. This removed all land with obvious constraints (priority habitats, Grade 1 and 2 farmland, peaty soils, developed land etc) and then applied positive attractors for woodland ."

With ministerial support and senior leaders from across forestry and railway in attendance, we have the opportunity to take some great strides."

            "text": "The data we have not only informs where we could grow trees but could also be used to establish other habitat types. We can look to see how planting further afield, for example in river catchment areas, could help to protect the railway from extreme weather events. We can build on relationships with our landowning neighbours to support them in opportunities for different methods of using their land in a time of challenging funding changes."

            "text": "We will share at the conference the work we have done to take our ideas from paper, to feasibility studies and onto trials. For the trials we identified a number of partners to form a consortium to get trees in the ground. Colleagues at Atkins introduced us to people working within the River Evenlode catchment which meant we could start to explore trial options - planting trees in a manner eligible for England Woodland Creation Offer funding to benefit the landowner, with the railway getting the benefit through, for example, reduced flooding."

            "text": "Aecom, with whom we are working, have also been able to show the farmer involved in the trial project that there are a couple of corners to the fields that, with a slight tweak to management, could benefit from increased biodiversity payments. The shelter belt examples also help to show prospective landowners that hedges, wood pasture and other agroforestry techniques are also eligible."

The National Nature Network is an opportunity to increase tree cover across the UK while maintaining a safe space for train travel, improving connectivity not only for our customers, but for the communities, both wildlife and human, who live alongside our estate."

The data we have will also mean that we can consider other habitat types as well. With the Forestry Commission, we have struck upon an opportunity to plant more trees, helping to tackle climate change, and benefiting nature and our railways."

We also know where we can put these hedges to create major potential for improving yield and animal welfare\u2026 and in fact major potential for improving yield and animal welfare."

            "text": "Over the next 10 years we don\u2019t need to chase numbers, trees, units or otherwise. We need good management plans delivered to the correct specification. That can then deliver safe operations, biodiversity improvements, carbon sequestration, health and well-being and a revitalisation of some land management industries. ."
