We found that the responding councils generally equip their staff with the digital and technical skills they need to meet their responsibilities. The majority of councils (61 out of 71) declared that they equipped their staff with the required skills to some extent, however only one council stated that it provided such training in full."

Some technologies, such as those that can be considered \u2018legacy\u2019, are less secure than modern varieties, and can also cause service delivery to be less efficient than it could be."

            "text": "Budget pressures can mean that councils face difficulties in upgrading, but servicing legacy technology is also very costly. On average, 15% of councils\u2019 digital budgets are spent maintaining legacy technology. While this is low, given the expense and potential vulnerabilities of these systems, we aim to see this figure reduced to zero as some councils reportedly have done already."
