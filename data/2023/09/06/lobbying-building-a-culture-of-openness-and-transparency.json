Whether proposing solutions, raising concerns or providing additional evidence, input from a wide range of participants makes for better laws and regulation.\u00a0"

The government accepted this recommendation in principle saying that\u00a0 \u201cthe scope of departments\u2019 transparency returns should be mirrored\u201d by the lobbying register, but would not commit to making the necessary change in legislation, saying that it would assess the impact of new transparency returns on departments before doing so.\u00a0"
