            "text": "Recent findings have included primary and secondary nests in Folkestone, Plymouth, and Maidstone. Normally, nests found low are primary nests, and nests found higher in trees are secondary nests. A queen starts a primary nest, but if the nest outgrows its position, or is disturbed, they may also build a higher, safer, warmer secondary nest. After the NBU locates a nest, we destroy it and then monitor for Asian hornets until no hornets are seen for five consecutive days. If Asian hornets continue to be caught, we continue our monitoring to check if another nest is present."

Many reports turn out to be similar looking insects to the Asian hornet such as the native European hornet. Credible reports without enough evidence are either asked for more detail, or forwarded to British Beekeepers Association Asian Hornet Teams, who help monitor for Asian hornets in the suspect area. You can find your local Asian Hornet Team Coordinator on the BBKA\u2019s website."
