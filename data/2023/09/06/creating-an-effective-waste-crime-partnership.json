Only in the last four years of that career did engagement with external stakeholders become essential to me, as a Counter Terrorism Security Adviser. With responsibility for five police force areas, part of my job was guiding a wide variety of stakeholders to implement measures to reduce their vulnerabilities and mitigate threats of attack."

A lot has been achieved across the country through partnerships since 2019, but there is still much to do. Filling in engagement gaps is one of them, as is improving what has already been created."

            "text": "Separate partnerships and groups that did exist in areas usually had fly-tipping as an additional agenda item, did not link up and sometimes were not aware of each others' existence. These included Rural Crime Groups, County Waste Partnerships focused on collection and disposal policies, and police-led partnerships with fly-tipping as a low priority. Groups were addressing fly-tipping and other waste crime as a side issue and, worse still, independently of each other. We know this is still the case in some parts of the country, but we are working on improving that."

We set about deciding what we wanted a partnership to achieve, then identifying the right people and post holders from potential partner agencies.
