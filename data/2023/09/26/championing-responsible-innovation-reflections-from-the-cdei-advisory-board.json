New machine learning technologies are bringing societal change at a scale and speed for which there is no prior precedent. The problem is made more complex because of its fundamentally socio-technical nature. This means that diverse expertise from academia, industry, government and third sector needs to be convened to ensure that the challenges are understood from all perspectives. Policy makers are then faced with the difficult challenge of operationalising this spectrum of advice by integrating it with pragmatism and nuanced understanding of the wider political and economic landscape. It has been an immense privilege to work so closely with the CDEI as they perform this difficult translation. I have been constantly impressed with their synthesis of these ideas into pragmatic policy interventions that have placed the UK at the forefront of the international regulatory landscape.\u201d"

As you will have heard before, the rate of technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, to the point where it is becoming unpredictable. Developments in previously disjointed fields, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing, genetics and biotechnology, are all building on and amplifying one another. With one innovation snowballing into another in this way, the last two years of work with the CDEI have been an evolving and exciting opportunity. I have particularly enjoyed the work I have supported on the Research Cloud options and the PETs Prize Challenge."

This is an area where there is a genuine opportunity for the UK to lead internationally, and the CDEI will be at the centre of this going forward. I look forward to seeing the CDEI\u2019s ongoing impact within the UK and internationally.\u201d"

            "text": "Professor Marion Oswald, MBE - CDEI Advisory Board member, 2021-23\n\u201cNow more than ever, governments, policymakers and industry need expert, constructive, critical friends to guide the technical and governance aspects of data-driven technology and AI. This is because the public expect responsible use of data, and scandals around data losses or reputationally damaging analytics mean that trust cannot be taken for granted."

It has provided operationally and context-focused initiatives to tackle challenging issues \u2013 I would highlight in particular the innovative Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard - which deserves to be more widely known and adopted throughout the public sector \u2013 the report on accessing demographic data for bias detection, the ongoing Assurance work and the upcoming Fairness Challenge. It has not been afraid to get into the \u2018nitty-gritty\u2019. Despite the disbanding of the Advisory Board, I look forward to the CDEI retaining its distinct identity and continuing its expert role to provide constructive and informed input, thus underpinning key aspects of the National AI Strategy.\u201d"

CDEI has played a pivotal role in promoting responsible innovation across both the public and private sectors since its establishment in 2018. During my time on the Advisory Board, CDEI has initiated world-leading, cutting-edge projects including AI Assurance, UK-US PETs prize challenges, Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard, the Fairness Innovation Challenge, among many others. Moving forward, I have no doubt that CDEI will continue to be a leading actor in delivering the UK's strategic priorities in the trustworthy use of data and AI and responsible innovation. I look forward to supporting this important mission for many years to come.\""
