I experienced social care before, during and after the Children Act 1989 came into play, so I had the absolute belief this was the path I wanted to be on."

I went on to become a peer educator and link counsellor at school and college. Now, years later, I have completed my Social Work Apprenticeship Degree and am ready and waiting to register as a qualified social worker. Let us just pause there to consider the reality and emotions of achieving a lifelong dream\u2026"

If this is how we work with people, we need to start applying this approach with ourselves first."
