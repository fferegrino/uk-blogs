Being a huge Eurovision fan, I can\u2019t wait for Thursday\u2019s talk on the making of Eurovision 2023\u00a0 as I\u2019m hoping we will get a real insight behind the scenes so I can bring out some fun facts when watching next year\u2019s! I am also intrigued to hear more about King Charles\u2019 visit to the Berlin embassy - I know Tom has hinted at some fun stories to come\u2026"

We also have a time difference with one speaker dialling in from Australia which required a little more thinking through!
