Sewers constructed from the late 1900s onwards are largely separate systems, carrying wastewater and surface water in different pipes. However, we still have thousands of miles of combined sewers in our towns and cities - enough to stretch two and half times around the world."

            "text": "The combined sewer system is designed so that at times of heavy rain or snow which exceeds (or overwhelms) sewer capacity, sewage diluted with water overflows into rivers and seas. That is what a storm overflow is. It is designed to prevent sewage backing up into properties and stops mains pipes bursting. There are strict permit conditions for when and how they should be used to protect our environment."

Thanks to increased monitoring we have been able to undertake the largest criminal investigation in the sector\u2019s history into the potential misuse of storm overflows."

However, there are exceptions which must also be considered, such as in very large catchments with long drain down times. The Environment Agency carries out a detailed modelling process, looking at local rainfall gauges and drainage times \u2013 as well as Met Office data \u2013 to establish if dry spills have happened. When data indicates that dry spills may have occurred, this is followed by an investigation on a site-by-site basis."

Where the data indicates a dry spill may have occurred, this is followed by an investigation on a site-by-site basis to determine, for example, that data from rainfall monitors and drain down times are correct, as well as other factors. The data must be rigorous enough to stand up in court if the Environment Agency chooses to prosecute in the future."

Since the major improvements seen in the 1990s when the water industry was privatised and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive came into effect, the rate of improvement has slowed due to an increasing population, ageing infrastructure, increased pollution risks and the pressure on our system from climate change."

Past classification methods were also not as precise as those we have now. Comparing the latest results with those from 2009, which indicates 25% of rivers were in good ecological condition, is not possible. That is because significant changes have been made to the classification methods and monitoring networks over this period \u2013 reflecting increased transparency through improving scientific knowledge and monitoring programmes."

Levels of ammonia have reduced to just 15% of their levels in 1990 and phosphorus discharges from wastewater treatment works have reduced 80% since 1990."
