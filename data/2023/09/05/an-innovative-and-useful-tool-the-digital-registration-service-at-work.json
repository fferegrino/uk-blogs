From my perspective, the firm has been trialling new approaches in its use of HM Land Registry\u2019s Digital Registration Service (DRS). Demonstrating how some customers are thinking outside the box, Victoria Humphries, a Commercial Real Estate Associate based in the firm\u2019s Cardiff office, explains how DRS is helping her and her Real Estate colleagues."

The DRS rollout has provided a new way to lodge and monitor applications, with the added advantage of being able to prepare applications and check the details, ahead of completion. It is great that the system picks up potential inconsistencies. It is user friendly and an unexpected but effective safeguard against minor errors."

            "text": "It also saves time. We can be confident that there are no \u2018human errors\u2019 when we lodge the application, because we have already run it through DRS. For example, it confirms that there are no irregularities with the names or the property description against the information held at HM Land Registry. When used in this way, it improves efficiency."

            "text": "If we encounter additional issues within our application preparation, we will be more likely to assess these costs accurately so that when it comes to billing, it is useful for both us and our client to have a clear picture of the global cost, on completion."

            "text": "When we are drafting the transaction documents, it is reassuring that we can use DRS to flag any inconsistencies before we complete the transaction, rather than when we lodge the application. For example, once a team member has completed a TR1 any errors spotted by HM Land Registry during the registration process will take considerably more time to put right, so by running it through DRS first we ensure that there are no avoidable delays."

Implementing DRS with our approach avoids simple errors. The service lends itself well to ironing out requisitions and we anticipate over the months ahead we will see requisition rates going down."

In this respect, working with Harrison Clark Rickerbys has been a real partnership and a pleasure. HCR\u2019s innovative use of our new tools has helped broaden HM Land Registry\u2019s understanding of how our customers can and do think outside of the box, not only maximising our service offer, but also adding value."
