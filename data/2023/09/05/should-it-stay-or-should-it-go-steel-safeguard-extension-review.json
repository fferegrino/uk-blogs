            "text": "Safeguard measures are emergency actions responding to increased imports of particular products, which cause serious injury to the importing country\u2019s domestic industry. They apply to all imports (with some exceptions), rather than being focused on imports from particular countries. They impose duties when imports exceed a level reflecting traditional trading patterns. The use of safeguard measures, the rules for which are set by the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, is rare."

It applies to nineteen categories of steel product, including hot and cold rolled flat steel, rods, wires, tubes and pipes."
