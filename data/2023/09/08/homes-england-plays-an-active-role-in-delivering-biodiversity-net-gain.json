Our Strategic Plan has a strong focus on ensuring the environmental impact of the new homes we support is minimised and their contribution to the natural environment is maximised. We\u2019re achieving this by planning and delivering biodiversity net gain (BNG). BNG is an approach that leaves more nature after development than before and where possible, on the same site."

By factoring BNG into scheme design as early as possible (before site acquisition), we can protect and enhance biodiversity while still delivering new homes."
