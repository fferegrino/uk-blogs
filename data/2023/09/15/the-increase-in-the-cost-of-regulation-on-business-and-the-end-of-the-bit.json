As a result, at the start of each parliament, the Government sets a target for the total regulatory burden on business of new regulation over the life of that parliament and the RPC confirms the Government\u2019s estimates of regulatory costs, so that progress against the BIT can be reported each year[1]."

            "text": "However, as we have previously commented, the BIT has not reduced regulatory costs in recent years (in fact they have increased substantially) and the Government has failed to meet the targets it has set itself. During the 2017-2019 parliament, the Government aimed to reduce regulatory costs by \u00a39bn, in fact, those costs rose\u00a0by \u00a37.8bn; while in the current (2019-2024) parliament, the Government set a holding target of no increase in regulatory costs, however costs have increased by \u00a314.3bn in the first 3 years. At the same time, important policy areas (that have had significant regulatory costs attached) have been exempt and not included in the BIT figures. Perhaps most significantly, having a target (and missing it) appears to have had little consequence for decisions about regulation by ministers."

Adding this to the total from the January 2023 BIT report gives an estimated increase in the regulatory burden on business for this parliament (up to the removal of the BIT) of around \u00a317.2 billion, against the Government\u2019s target of no increase in the BIT.
