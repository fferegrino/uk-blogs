With just a small investment from Policy Profession we have uncovered an iceberg of interest in policy design, we have rapidly grown to hundreds of members in 75 public sector organisations and developed a university-based network with hundreds of members from academia, public practice and private practice."

Examples include the use of multidisciplinary teams and \u2018red teams\u2019 to stress test proposals, and using deliberative methods to involve the public in policy design and decision making... These methods are sometimes used in government already\u2026 for example, Policy Lab [founder member of the policy design community]. Concrete plans are required for how these methods will be mainstreamed into regular departmental practices, and robustly upheld as indispensable elements of policy work. So to continue to improve the quality of its policy advice to ministers, the civil service should focus in 2023 on building on good practice highlighted by the likes of Policy Lab and the policy profession \u2026High-level political and official advocacy will be essential if positive examples are to be built upon.\u201d"
