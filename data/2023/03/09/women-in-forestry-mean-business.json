            "text": "When I joined the Institute of Chartered Foresters in 2019 I had very little idea what forestry was. I knew being out in nature felt good, but I didn\u2019t give any thought to the thousands of wood products that surround us in the houses we live in, that keep us warm, that make up our clothing and even toothpaste \u2013 let alone where it all came from and the huge range of thriving businesses that support its production."

            "text": "Now it is well recognised that trees are vital assets in the fight against climate change and our route to sustainable businesses and communities. Nowhere else is this as clear as in farming, where land managers are realising the opportunities of integrating trees on farms for their businesses, as well as for the environment (as we\u2019ll explore in April at our conference Connecting Trees, Farmers and Foresters)."

There is no one better to shape this conversation than these women leaders-in-the-making on this programme who work tirelessly to plan, grow, plant, establish, manage, harvest, process and research the timber society needs. They also showcase the diverse range of fantastic careers that working with trees and woodlands can offer."

Planting high quality seedlings well-adapted to their environment is vital to generate thriving woodlands, that benefit both nature and the production of sustainable timber."

            "text": "Miriam Jones-Walters MICFor, Natural Resources Wales\nMy job is to create new woodlands, so timber and other wood products are a long way off. However, it\u2019s no less important to think about how new woodlands will contribute to wood culture than it is for mature woodlands. I feel incredibly lucky to be doing this job now, and I hope that future generations are able to realise the thriving wood culture we can picture as we plant tiny saplings today."

            "text": "Shona Smyth MICFor, Institute of Chartered Foresters\nHow we manage our woodlands and forests going forward will be key to shaping the rural economy and our relationship with farming and the wider environment. It\u2019s the wider thinking and understanding of the rural economy that will drive the industry forward.\u00a0Working in the forestry sector is always a school day. Everyone brings their own perspective and ideas and this has never been more vital than now, with a skills crisis and the climate emergency."

Our forests are a mix of conifer plantations and amenity broadleaved woodlands, so we manage for timber production as well as recreation and biodiversity."

            "text": "Ros Wardman MICFor, Scottish Forestry\nThere is a catch all line in my job description that states \u2018supporting any activity linked to trees, timber and the woodland setting\u2019 which highlights how flexible a woodland can be at producing numerous revenue streams. Through my role I support and promote the Scottish hardwood sector which is a valuable commodity within the timber industry with locally grown and milled wood becoming beautiful furniture, a sustainable construction material or an energy source for example."

            "text": "Dr Eleanor Tew MICFor, Forestry England\nI love working with forests because they have huge potential to provide benefits for both society and nature. From timber production and carbon sequestration to recreation and heritage value, healthy forests underpin a healthy society. And when managed well, they\u2019re also crucial habitats for biodiversity. In my role, I work at the interface between science and practice, leading on embedding concepts around natural capital and forest resilience into practical delivery. It can be challenging but always rewarding, and a privilege to be able to influence how we manage our amazing forests."

But with so many reasons to diversify, working together with people like this we can meet the needs of businesses, the rural economy, the environment and society."
