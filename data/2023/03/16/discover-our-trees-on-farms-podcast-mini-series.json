I also make sure our woodlands are fit for the future, looking at things like pests and diseases, climate change, drought and advise people on how to make their woodlands more resilient and better able to cope with these threats.\u00a0"

We wanted to highlight how farmers can make the most of the opportunities that are available and show the benefits that trees can provide in productive systems. Over three episodes on the Meet the Farmers podcast, Ben and I met foresters and farmers to explore those opportunities, and ask what more can be done to help farmers make the most from the trees on their land.\u00a0\u00a0"
