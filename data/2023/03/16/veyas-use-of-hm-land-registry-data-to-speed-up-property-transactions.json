Veya provides an instant and comprehensive analysis of HM Land Registry title deeds \u2013 giving anyone access to a layperson understanding of property titles (the evidence of a person\u2019s right to property). Through our system you gain insight into risks, opportunities or issues that may be present within any land/property title in England and Wales, so you can make the right decisions with confidence and clarity."

By reading the title deeds from the outset, I could address issues early on to ensure a smoother and quicker sale. However, the legal jargon in the deeds often made it difficult to understand, and solutions or recommendations are not provided. I had to do a lot of additional research to understand the potential impact of certain title issues, and what to do next to resolve them."
