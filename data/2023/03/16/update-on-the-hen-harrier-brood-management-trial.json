            "text": "Natural England is involved in several initiatives under the Hen Harrier Action Plan, one of which is the brood management trial. Brood management involves taking the eggs or chicks of some Hen Harriers nesting on grouse moors into captivity, rearing them to fledging age, and releasing them back into the wild in the uplands of northern England. This reduces the density of active Hen Harrier nests on grouse moors and is thought to reduce predation pressure on red grouse during the breeding season. In theory, this should lead to changes in some of the negative perceptions and behaviours within moorland communities and reduce illegal persecution of Hen Harriers. Illegal persecution is the main threat to the recovery of this iconic and at-risk species in England, and Natural England is committed to working with partners to tackle this \u2013 see previous blogs for further details."

        {
            "text": "The brood management trial was designed to test the theoretical assumptions behind the technique. The availability of brood management should change attitudes of grouse moor managers by reducing the perceived threat of nesting hen harriers to grouse shooting interests. This should result in lower levels of persecution, leading to increasing survival rates of hen harriers (measured by satellite tracking) and finally to increasing numbers of hen harrier nests. The trial aimed to measure changes in all of these things, compared to before the introduction of brood management. The trial was also intended to practically test the methods, and impact on the birds, of taking, captive-rearing and releasing hen harrier chicks, as this had not been done before in the UK."

            "text": "The trial is a partnership project, with activities led on the ground by the Moorland Association working with its members, and the International Centre for Birds of Prey leading the avicultural aspects. Natural England leads the monitoring and evaluation activities, and chairs the project board. The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Hawk and Owl Trust also sit on the group. All wild birds, their nests and eggs are protected by law. As such, a licence from Natural England is required in order for the trial to operate lawfully. As Natural England is involved in delivering the trial, a strict separation of roles within the organisation is maintained at all times between staff involved in the trial and staff involved in the licence application assessment process."

            "text": "The trial was initially envisaged as running for 5\u201310 years, and the first licence for brood management was issued in 2018. However, in that year there were no nests eligible for brood management, and no activity took place. By the end of 2022, while only four years of brood management activity had been carried out (in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022), the trial had reached the end of the initial five-year period, and the results to date were therefore reviewed by the NE Science Advisory Committee to inform a decision on the future role of brood management. The headlines from this review are given below:"

This appears to have worked well, with the 35 captive-reared chicks surviving well to point of release (97%), showing good survival rates to one year and beyond (see graph below), and with five individuals going on to successfully breed and raise their own chicks in the wild."

(Note that this figure excludes the 2022 birds, since they are currently less than a year old). This survival rate is higher than for wild birds satellite tagged over the same time period (24% survival to one year old)."

An interim social science study, led by NE, has provided some evidence of positive engagement with the trial and some positive signs of attitude change among participants. However, it has not been possible, to date, to test attitudes in the wider community beyond those participating in the trial."

This result was not predicted by the original theoretical framework, which stated that survival rates of all hen harriers should improve if brood management worked as expected. Details regarding the individual fates of all hen harriers tagged by Natural England, in the wild and under the brood management trial, can be viewed on this page."

            "text": "Numbers of nesting hen harriers in England have increased considerably since the start of the brood management trial, from only 12 nesting attempts in 2018, up to 49 in 2022 (see graphs below). Numbers of nesting attempts in land managed for forestry, and moorland not managed for grouse shooting, have remained roughly steady in that time, at around ten attempts per year, and the increases have mainly been seen in land managed wholly or partly for grouse shooting. While an increasing number of hen harrier nests have been recorded on estates intensively managed for driven grouse shooting, it is noted that land recorded as \u2018grouse moor\u2019 also includes less intensively managed areas, and that the effects of the availability of brood management on attitudes may be affected by the management regime in place at the site and whether driven grouse shooting is a primary objective."

However, it is not yet possible to conclude how the availability of brood management may have influenced the observed increase, or to establish the effect of this availability on members of the wider grouse moor management community not directly associated with the trial."
