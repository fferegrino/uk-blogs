It\u2019s a vacuum cleaner attachment that uses suction power to stick the vacuum to the wall. This helps conscientious trades people and keen but clean DIY enthusiasts catch any debris created by drilling a hole, while still having two hands free to focus on the drilling itself. Alan was hoping to secure a \u00a340k investment from the Dragons, in return for a 10% stake in his business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

It can\u2019t be an obvious change to something that already exists. In the Den, Alan gave a demonstration of products from competitors that work in a similar way to the Xtra Hand, which made me wonder if this could have been the issue he faced when applying for a patent.\u00a0"
