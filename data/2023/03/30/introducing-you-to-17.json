            "text": "There\u2019s no typical day as we tend to do a bit of everything which adds to the variety. One day I could be processing the field visit findings and the next I could be doing verification or amendments. I love the variety of my work, and some of what we do is like a big puzzle that needs working out. We also have a good team of processors in Carlisle who work well together."

            "text": "The greatest impact my work has on the customer is helping them manage their environment correctly and helping them understand they will benefit financially if they keep all the information they give us as accurate as possible. Customers who get found satisfactory get the reassurance that they\u2019re completing their information correctly. At the end of the day both we and the customer have the same end goal of ensuring all claims are correct and they get paid correctly."

Before that I worked in a department store primarily selling furniture, and then briefly as a data input clerk at Cumbria County Council."

We live just north of the border in Scotland, a few miles north of Lockerbie in Dumfries and Galloway.\u00a0 We spend a lot of time between our respective families in Carlisle and Lockerbie which certainly keeps us busy. I also like travelling about and visiting places, going to sporting events and concerts."

            "text": "Those that work with me know, that aside from my wife and son, my main passion is Carlisle United. I go to all the home games, and I did go to most of the away games, but since having Spencer I calmed this down to spend time with him. Outside work I\u2019m also a Scottish Council member for Muscular Dystrophy UK. My involvement for the past 13 years comes from having one of the conditions that comes under this umbrella. I\u2019ve won awards for campaigning and volunteering for the charity in the past - it\u2019s a very worthwhile charity to fundraise for - which culminated in being invited to a Queen\u2019s Garden party at Buckingham palace a few years ago."
