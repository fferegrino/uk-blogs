I was however, pleased to watch such IP-rich conversations, which I\u2019ll break down for any budding business owners looking to protect their assets."

These included a patch that absorbs moisture from under the arms, nipple covers and a hair removal device. Theresa was after \u00a3150,000 for a 30% investment and immediately took a grilling from the Dragons over Dandi\u2019s turnover. The heat was turned up and Theresa sweated over the company\u2019s net loss but managed to explain the reasons behind her large spend. Since the absorbent patch is a very technical product, Theresa wisely thought it best to apply for patent protection which covers the key ways in which it works.\u00a0"

It also costs money, so you need to make sure that the potential benefit of a patent will outweigh the time, effort and money it takes to get and maintain one. We strongly advise you to seek legal advice before applying.\u00a0"

They asked for \u00a360,000 for 8% of their business and reeled off some impressive accolades the product has received so far. The couple disclosed that they have an international patent pending and have already heard from the US Patent and Trademark Office that their application is likely to be accepted. When questioned about the \u201cinternational patent\u201d, they revealed that they are selling in 37 countries worldwide. \u00a0"

            "text": "It\u2019s brilliant that they\u2019ve already thought about overseas protection because IP rights are territorial. They only give protection in the countries where they are granted or registered. This means that if you only have UK protection, others may be allowed to use your IP abroad without infringing your rights. So, if you are thinking about trading overseas then you should always consider registering your IP rights there."
