We enable policy teams to keep up to date with a rapidly evolving technology landscape and respond to potential risks and opportunities. Our data and expert insight support government departments to make better strategic decisions on science and technology."

            "text": "Each assessment involves a range of academic, industry, and government experts from the UK and beyond. We combine their insight with our own analysis of international research and investment activity. Each RTA is thoroughly reviewed by these experts and undergoes analytical quality assurance before they are shared."

            "text": "RTAs\u00a0have different uses depending on the topic. They can help us understand the likely potential of a technology and how close to being ready it is (for example, 4D Printing). Or they can summarise the latest developments in a technology already known to be important (such as Artificial Intelligence). The topics we choose for an RTA are based on our horizon scanning and the interests of other departments. We deliberately cover a wide range of technologies at different readiness levels. Our topic selection does not represent a policy view of priorities."
