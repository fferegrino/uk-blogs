In October she blogged on some of the visits she had made to start the work she is doing with us.\u00a0 Since then she\u2019s spoken to a variety of individuals and organisations, with still more on her list to come."

These sessions are taking place in libraries all over the country from Ipswich to Leeds, focusing on one of the 7 strategic outcomes in Ambition, plus sessions on libraries governance and \u2018blue sky thinking\u2019."
