My tutors and staff on placement encourage this during placement , as it helps you to think about the wider context when working with families. You are able to analyse how policy, and legislation affects families and how as social workers we can support those who are vulnerable. I have found myself enjoying applying research and academia to practice and taking a theoretical, critically analytical approach has genuinely made me a better social worker."

It has never been more important to think about how people are affected by class, race and gender difference and to work to support them through our practice. One key point of learning for me was around intersectionality. I have used this learning to support those who are more vulnerable to discrimination due to unique characteristics."
