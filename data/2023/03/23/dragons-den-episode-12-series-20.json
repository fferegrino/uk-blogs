Caroline\u2019s product had a USP in that the product addresses the root cause of many skin and hair problems, a hormonal imbalance, from within the body."

            "text": "Deborah Meaden felt uneasy about how the product might stand out in a crowded market and declared that she was out. Whilst this could have knocked Caroline\u2019s confidence, things got considerably better as all the other Dragons decided to make an offer, albeit for more equity than Caroline had initially offered."

            "text": "After some deliberation, Caroline asked Peter Jones and Steven Bartlett if they would be willing to join forces as she saw the potential in Peter\u2019s ability to open doors, coupled with Steven\u2019s online marketing prowess. They were both happy to enter into such an arrangement, and Caroline\u2019s growing confidence meant she was able to knock down the equity being offered, with a guarantee that the Dragons would see a return from their investment within 18 months."

            "text": "The interest in Caroline\u2019s business and products will no doubt have been helped by the fact that she already holds a granted patent for her plant-based skin remedy. From the point of view of an investor, there can be quite a difference between an inventor having applied for a patent (and therefore having a \u201cpatent pending\u201d) and having a granted patent. The latter having been examined by a patent examiner, who will have searched for similar inventions and is satisfied that what\u2019s in the patent is novel and inventive. A granted patent puts the inventor in a strong position, as there is certainty around what their patent covers, and therefore what a competitor is allowed to do."

After the Dragons drilled down into the business, it became apparent that what the chocolatiers were looking for investment in, was actually an extension of an already successful business which involved Steve\u2019s brother. As Peter Jones put it, \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019ve come in and pitched an idea for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but you\u2019ve left Charlie at home\u201d."

            "text": "Whilst Steve and Hamza did mention that they would own any intellectual property that came out of the side business, this was not enough to convince four of the Dragons that this was a business they could invest in. Things got sweeter for the pair, however, when Sara Davies said that she was keen to add a chocolate business to her portfolio. Despite the issues that had been discussed, Sara offered all of the money for a 30% share of the business. Although Steve and Hamza briefly considered negotiating to a lower equity level, they decided to go with what was on offer."

Lisa was looking for \u00a330k in return for 10% of her business but the Dragons felt that the product may be too niche and declined to invest after Lisa failed to get to grips with her figures."

After four of the Dragons dropped out, it was left to Peter Jones to come through with an unexpected offer after he had been impressed with the duo\u2019s initial figures. Ben and Phil had offered 5% for a \u00a3200k investment, and for such an investment Peter wanted a third of the business \u2013 which proved to be a gap that the two parties were unable to bridge."
