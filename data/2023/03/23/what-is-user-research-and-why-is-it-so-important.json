In preparation for my role, I read all I could about user research. However, it took a while to get to grips with all the jargon and to fully understand exactly what user research was and why it was so important."

Carried out through Microsoft Teams, these meetings typically run between 60-90 minutes and include conversations in a 1:1 setting. During this time you may be asked about your interactions with our existing services, and what you might expect from future services. We may also ask you to test partial or full prototype/trial services, guidance pages, or other content."

Before the session begins, our user researcher will confirm with you whether you agree to be recorded. We also occasionally have a separate team member observing sessions or helping us to take notes \u2013 if you are uncomfortable with this however, just let us know when booking a session."
