            "text": "Recommendation 1: Government departments should set out time-bound delivery plans for publishing their outstanding, and upcoming, post-implementation review reports of environmental laws, prioritising those laws for which there is currently no published report. These plans and their prioritisation should reflect the need for post-implementation review to inform decisions about specific laws arising in connection with, for example, the REUL, Energy, and Levelling-up and Regeneration Bills."

            "text": "Recommendation 2: Government should ensure that, before it proposes to keep, amend, repeal or replace an environmental law it, Parliament, the public and others, have recourse to an up-to-date post-implementation review report (or similar evaluation of the law\u2019s implementation where post-implementation review is not a legal requirement). This means a review should be completed and a report published in good time ahead of decisions being taken in relation to that law. Any discrepancy between the findings of the report and the proposed decision should be explained."

            "text": "Recommendation 3: All government departments should ensure wherever relevant that post-implementation reviews are undertaken taking appropriate account of implications for environmental protection and improvement, including by considering relevant environmental policies, targets and legislation."

            "text": "The RPC has also been critical of the Government\u2019s performance on PIRs more generally. Our blog post Is regulation working as intended? \u00a0in September 2021 commented that, in the previous two years, less than 40% of PIRs had been completed on time \u2013 and since then the situation has not improved. We commented on how important PIRs are to improving regulation. They assess whether legislation is having the intended effect and whether the actual impacts are similar to those expected when the policy was put in place. They ensure consideration of whether changes to regulation are required."

        {
            "text": "We support the OEP\u2019s work looking at how well departments have been doing on PIRs. Their conclusions \u2013 challenging not only Defra, but also other departments who legislate on the environment (notably the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the Department for Levelling UP, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) and the Department for Transport (DfT)) \u2013 reinforce our own concerns about the Government\u2019s lack of commitment to evaluating legislation once it is in place."

We hope that all departments will similarly address the backlog of both environmental and other PIRs, and we look forward to scrutinising those PIRs as they are produced."

            "text": "One of the five new regulatory principles that the Government has committed itself to in the Benefits of Brexit document is: \u201cRecognising what works. We will thoroughly analyse our interventions based on the outcomes they produce in the real world and where regulation does not achieve its objectives or does so at unacceptable cost, we will ensure it is revised or removed.\u201d"
        },
        {
            "text": "In order to deliver on that commitment departments need to carry out PIRs when they are required. They also need to act on their findings by revising or removing regulations as appropriate. It is therefore vital that the reformed Better Regulation Framework has stronger measures in place to ensure that PIRs are undertaken and that they are acted on."
