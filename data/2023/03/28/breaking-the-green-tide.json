            "text": "Coastal areas of the Channel Manche region (between England and France) have an excess level of nutrients (such as nitrogen) from river run-off and urban discharges, which causes excessive growth of green algal mats. Seaweeds will begin to build up over time on mudflats forming dense mats containing many layers of individual algae (Figure 1). Decaying algal mats are unpleasant to look at, and cause reductions in biodiversity and prey density for wading birds and wildfowl. The gases produced during seaweed decomposition can also be toxic to animals and humans if present in high quantities."
