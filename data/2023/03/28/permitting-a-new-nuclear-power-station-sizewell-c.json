I have worked for the Environment Agency since it was created in 1996 (and the National Rivers Authority - its predecessor - since 1990). In all those years this is, by far, the most challenging, exciting, interesting, and rewarding job that I\u2019ve held."

The\u00a0 recent\u00a0British Energy Security Strategy\u00a0sets out how the UK is going to deliver a pipeline of new nuclear projects to contribute to this ambition. The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy granted development consent to the Sizewell C project in July 2022."

We started our pre-permit application discussions with NNB Generation Company (Sizewell C) Limited around a decade ago, which is hard to believe now. Our focus has always been to obtain the best outcome for the environment, which is tough to do in such a sensitive environment. Habitats and ecology must be protected, that is our starting point, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the operation of this power station will do so."

We wanted to be confident in our assessments and so demanded the best information available to help us reach our decisions. We broke through those barriers, and by doing so we have arrived at decisions, which are both thorough and robust."

Early engagement is really important to us, as is keeping everyone informed, and being open and transparent about what we are doing. Last summer, during our consultation, we met with local people in village halls and answered questions about our work. One of the most popular questions we were asked about was how confident we were that the sensitive ecology and habitats would be protected. Fortunately, we had completed a massive piece of work to assess the project against the Habitats Regulations and our conclusion had been reviewed, and agreed to, by Natural England \u2013 so providing positive answers was much easier."
