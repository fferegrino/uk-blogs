The changes have largely focussed on further improving your experiences as users of the calculation tool and its accompanying guidance."

The biodiversity metric is already being used in a wide variety of ways, particularly by organisations who have decided to implement BNG ahead of it becoming a mandatory requirement. This engagement has been hugely valuable for Natural England and Defra to build confidence that we have an approach to measuring biodiversity gains that is both practical and scientifically robust.\nOne unexpected benefit that has emerged is that stakeholders feel the metric could have wider application beyond the implementation of BNG. This is particularly encouraging and we\u2019d welcome engagement with anyone who thinks they could use this to pursue their organisation\u2019s nature positive\u2019 ambitions."
