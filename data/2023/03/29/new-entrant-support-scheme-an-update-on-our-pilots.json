Some are young adults and always knew that farming is their future, so everything so far has been completely focussed on that goal. Others have already had a career elsewhere and so bring very high levels of knowledge about finance, marketing, the third sector and business. This is leading to innovative thinking and a lot of sharing and collaboration.\""

Although stretched for time by the programme overlapping into the growing season and other work or family commitments, the vast majority participants have remain very engaged with the programme and have found the blended and varied approaches to learning and grounding in business development valuable.\""
