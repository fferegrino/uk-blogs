The vibe after this prayer is amazing because the whole community is sat in the mosque whilst various acts of worship are occurring such as religious advice from the\u00a0imam\u00a0(Islamic equivalent of a priest) and individual recitation of the Quran may also be taking place."

The mosque provides fresh dates and water for all in this blessed month. The evening meal with which we break our fast is called\u00a0\u201cFutoor\u201d. After establishing the Maghrib prayer with congregation at the mosque, I\u2019ll rush home and instantly be hit by the lovely smell of food that my wife has cooked for our family."

The 5 daily prayers are obligatory throughout the year but in the month of Ramadhan we are lucky to be blessed with another prayer after Esha which is called\u00a0\u201cTaraweeh\u201d. In this prayer, 1 chapter of the Holy Quran is recited each night and, in this way, the entire Quran is completed over 30 days. The Taraweeh prayer usually lasts up to 1 hour (mostly standing), so it\u2019s crucial to get your stretches in beforehand!"

It is a day of exchanging gifts with family and friends and reminiscing over the countless blessings we were blessed with during the month of Ramadhan. This is an amazing time to catch up and reconnect with family members who we have not seen for a while."

            "text": "To summarise, the month of Ramadhan is a month to become closer to Allah. It is a month to recite the Holy Quran (as we believe it is Allah\u2019s words). It is a month of charity and self-reflection. The amount of charity given in this month is unbelievable as we hope to make a difference around the world. Fasting allows us to empathise with those around the world who are struggling with starvation and the main goal is to try and gain piety."
