But the commitment to ensuring fair treatment and reward for all isn\u2019t just mine; it\u2019s a key theme within our EDI strategy and a shared goal to deliver effective change for everyone at Companies House. As we look to celebrate this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, it feels like a good time to reflect on one area we\u2019re continuing to work on - our gender pay gap.\u00a0"

In April 2017, gender pay gap reporting regulations were introduced. These require all employers of 250 or more employees to publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap each year. The idea behind the reporting was to narrow and eventually eliminate pay differences between men and women.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Although 4 of our 7 most senior employees are women, including our chief executive and myself as director of finance and commercial, we have a significant number of women employed in the band B (administrative officer) grade, which results in a higher proportion of female employees in our lower and lower middle quartiles. In the upper middle quartile, we have a 50/50 split of men and women, and in the upper quartile the breakdown is 40.4% female and 59.6% male.\u00a0"

The potential loss of government-paid benefits following promotion also came through. \u00a0"

I\u2019m proud to be a visible role model for other women, and that includes sharing my own career journey to help dispel negative perceptions. I worked part-time when my children were young but successfully progressed from a senior executive officer to a grade 6, and only went full-time when I took on my executive board role. \u00a0"
