I then ensured the final draft of the blog was ready to post along with a LinkedIn caption.\u00a0"

This is something I have been working on, alongside our Digital Manager Paul Mayes, since October 2022, as part of the IPA internal communications campaign. The podcast aims to create a more joined up and collaborative IPA by offering colleagues the opportunity to talk about their career journey and personal experiences. In turn we gain a better understanding of the individual behind the role/screen, following a period where we were all working from home and had limited opportunities to connect. In turn, this filters down into delivering a better service for our stakeholders, because of higher quality information sharing and cross-team working. "

So, before heading home, I created a draft post ready to share the following day. We have some amazing projects nominated this year including: The Maritime Multi-Link Programme (Royal Navy), Sustainable Farming Incentive (Defra) and Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (DCMS)."
