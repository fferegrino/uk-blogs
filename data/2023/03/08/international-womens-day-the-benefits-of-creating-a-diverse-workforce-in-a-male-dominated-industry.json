The redevelopment of the UK\u2019s primary capability for animal health science is critical in maintaining UK trade, providing emergency response to disease outbreaks and safeguarding animal health. The need for which has been brought into even sharper focus with the recent COVID-19 pandemic and current avian influenza outbreak in the UK and beyond."

To truly foster belonging and inclusion we need to go further than giving equal opportunities \u2013 we need to take equitable action. So, what is the difference between equality and equity and why is this distinction so important?"
