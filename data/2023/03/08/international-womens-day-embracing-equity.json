I had married someone in the RAF and I was leaving my home in the North East of England and was moving 600-miles south without my family and friends support network being on the doorstep. I was now living in Service Families Accommodation, mixing with Service families, and someone mentioned that there was a work opportunity within the Civil Service at RAF Daws Hill, High Wycombe as a Contracts Officer."

            "text": "That was really a transforming moment for me. I was off work for six-months, but the support I received from my team and the Civil Service was amazing. I had a HR Case Worker assigned to me, Ann Pemberton, who explained everything that I needed to do and generally just looked after me from a pastoral perspective.\u00a0 As I couldn\u2019t drive, team members took me to and from work so I could keep in touch. I\u2019d never worked anywhere that had looked after me like that before. Getting through that period of my life and regaining my health helped me to build resilience and from then on, I had a passion to make sure people around me were supported and looked after in their place of work."

I also mentor ex-offenders, helping them adjust to moving back into society, helping with CVs, interviews etc. It\u2019s very rewarding and I learn a lot about how people manage and deal with change.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a chance for me to share what I have learned and to give something back; I see this as part of my role in the workplace \u2013 to be of service to others. I\u2019ve also learned that supporting individuals and empowering people is crucial for creating dynamic and healthy workplaces for all of us. As women, I believe, we have a vital role to play in this."

Notably, I was the first, and only woman to date, to run the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre and the MOD\u2019s Medal Office where I led a team of fantastically dedicated individuals who dealt with the deaths, from incident to burial, including repatriations of serving Armed Forces personnel, many of whom had died during the Afghanistan campaign. Within that role I also saw the very end of the role out of the late Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Medal, two new WWII medals (Bomber Command Clasp & Arctic Star) instituted culminating in a presentation by Prime Minister David Cameron to some of the remaining Veterans at 10 Downing Street."

We saw families juggling work with home schooling and caring responsibilities and there was an authenticity to how people were showing up for work, that we didn\u2019t see before. People were seeing you for who you were rather than a version of yourself, and I truly believe that we must ensure that this continues.\u00a0 The more we invested in our people during that time elicited dedication and loyalty within the team and the organisation.\u00a0 In my experience, I saw new friendships forged, a greater empathy emerged and a sense of humour reigned."

It\u2019s allowed us to be more empathetic with our leadership. The more comfortable we are in the workplace to be ourselves, the better it will be for all of us and that\u2019s what this year\u2019s theme for IWD is all about \u2013 building equity and accepting people for who they are."
