Our gender champion, Esther Wallington, passionately supports the vision for women progressing into senior roles at HMRC and we see regular support from Angela MacDonald, who acts as champion and advocate for menopause support. It makes a big difference seeing our senior leaders being courageous, visible, and open about some of the barriers women face and how as an organisation we continue to tackle those barriers.\u00a0"

There are multiple opportunities to network across this organisation and you can find or be an inspiration to other women regardless of age, grade, and backgrounds. HMRC really is a great place to work, and for me that is mostly down to the people, opportunities and support that is on offer.\u00a0"
