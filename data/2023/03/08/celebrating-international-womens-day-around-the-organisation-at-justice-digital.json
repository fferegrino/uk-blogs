I decided not to go to university in and instead learned everything I could in my role to have the skills to eventually leave. I joined the Civil Service as the Office Manager for the Sheffield Studio back in February 2020 and have not looked back! I am so proud to call myself a woman in tech here at Justice Digital!"

I had a brilliant female mentor and coach who created a plan of learning activities to cover the different skills I would need to learn as an Interaction Designer. My dream career has now become a reality!"
