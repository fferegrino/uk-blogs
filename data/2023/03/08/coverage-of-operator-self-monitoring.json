            "text": "Operator Self-Monitoring was introduced in 2009 alongside guidance on Environment Agency inspections. The use of\u00a0operator\u00a0self-monitoring\u00a0brings water and sewerage companies in line with other industries which have been\u00a0monitored\u00a0in this way for many years e.g. waste and chemical sectors. Under the polluter pays principle, they should also be the ones paying for it."

            "text": "In 2019 the EA increased, not decreased, its regulatory scrutiny of sewage treatment works to include auditing, data analysis and other interventions as well as inspections. This removed the outdated inspection guidance and replaced it with action to use a wider range of regulatory tools. This increases the level of scrutiny, rather than reduces it."
