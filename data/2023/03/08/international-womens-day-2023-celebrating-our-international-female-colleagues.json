Their collaborative project aimed to increase the capacity of trade regulators to detect illegally traded species of sharks and rays, in part through visual identification training of shark products (e.g. fins). Monika took part in a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d workshop in Jakarta in January 2020 where she studied eight new modules on shark trade monitoring, and received visual ID training from world expert, Dr Rima Jabado."

            "text": "\u201cWorking as an Indonesian government inspector to verify trade in shark products is challenging because sharks and rays can look so alike. As well as full-body fish, we encounter many derivative products, like fins, oil, skin, and meat from a variety of species. High-accuracy identification can be obtained using DNA but due to the high-cost and high-large-frequency of trade in many provinces in Indonesia, visual identification is still the best method to monitor trade. However, visual identification is often based on personal judgments from practical experience. In 2020, Cefas through the\u00a0Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund project assisted the Indonesian Government to equip inspectors with shark and ray product identification training and the development of training modules. Through this training, I learnt the science behind the identification process - how to observe, collect, and analyse the key distinguishing features of the species in the form of derivative products. First and foremost, we have to understand external morphology and the terminology for the full body, so that whenever we encounter unfamiliar characteristics in the products, we can use references that have been available to figure out from what species the product is made. The sustainability of shark and ray species depends on accurate identification as it is this data that will provide the basis for determining shark and ray management policies to realise sustainable use.\u201d"

The aquaculture sector plays a major role in Nigeria\u2019s economy which provides support to many people directly and indirectly, encompasses trading, processing, and farming. There are a number of challenges that threaten the sustainability of the aquaculture sector. A major issue that has hampered the development of the sector in Nigeria is the lack of information about the prevention, treatment, and control of fish infections which is further complicated by the lack of a diagnostic lab for fish diseases. During the course of my training, I carried out a gap analysis of the situation of Antimicrobial Use (AMU) and AMR in aquaculture in my home country. Several gaps were identified, and a work plan was developed based on the analysis. Through this training, it has helped to strengthen my capacity on Quality Management Systems, quality of AMR diagnostics, data interpretation and advanced methods in surveillance of AMU and\u00a0 AMR. I was also allowed to explore my AMR curiosity with guidance enabling me to contribute in my own way to the scientific body of knowledge. As a female in science, it feels awesome presenting some of my research in conferences, workshops, etc."

Since then, I have focused on the issues of climate change, the effect of climate change on aquatic animals and food security. Recently I have completed a training program arranged by Cefas at their laboratory in Weymouth, UK. This training provided me with practical knowledge on the treatment of tissue samples, histopathology and in-situ hybridization for disease detection in aquatic animals.\u00a0 It was a great opportunity for me as a novice researcher to meet many female scientists and researchers at Cefas. Currently, I'm working to improve the BAU laboratory facilities with the assistance of my fellow co-workers, as our lab infrastructure is not that advanced and I am also encouraging female students to pursue research careers. Indeed, Bangladesh offers a wide range of opportunities for scientific and fieldwork employment. Yet, due to several societal constraints and environmental issues, it can be rather challenging for women to operate at the fieldwork level. Despite that fact, there are more and more motivated female students. We are now working with a fresh sense of optimism to support female students and incorporate them in aquaculture research for the overall advancement of our nation.\u201d"

She became acting Head of the School and then Deputy Director of the Institute of Applied Sciences in 2020. She has been a part of the CME programme from the start, where she helped Cefas to identify and support two young, amazing Pacific students to complete their Masters on seagrass mapping, and modelling.\u00a0 She was also a key contributor to the Climate Change report card in the Pacific (funded by UK CME programme), leading on the chapter that reported on Effects of Climate Change on Seagrasses and Seagrass Habitats Relevant to the Pacific Islands.
