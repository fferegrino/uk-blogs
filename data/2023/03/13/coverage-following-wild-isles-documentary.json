The programme features a number of Natural England\u2019s reserves, including Shapwick Heath on the Somerset Levels.

            "text": "Nature has been in long-term decline and we have laid foundations to turn this around: In 2021, the government passed the Environment Act which sets legally-binding targets to improve the environment and created a legally binding target for species abundance for 2030. The Act also supported the creation of a Nature Recovery Network, a legal duty for new developments to deliver a Biodiversity Net Gain and created Local Nature Recovery Strategies which will increase investment for nature. We also recognise that farming and the environment must go hand-in-hand, which is why we have designed a new system to reward farmers for their stewardship of our countryside and nature-friendly farming."

            "text": "We are building on these achievements with our new Environmental Improvement Plan published earlier this year, which includes creating and restoring at least 500,000 hectares of new wildlife habitats; transforming the management of 70% of our countryside by incentivising farmers to adopt nature-friendly practices; a new multi-million pound Species Survival Fund targeted at protecting our rarest species; and introducing the first set of Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs)."

This will not come at the expense of the UK\u2019s already high standards - we can keep protections in place and make reforms tailored to our needs."
