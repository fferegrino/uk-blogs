I get to know the residents and support their day-to-day needs, which they\u2019re very grateful for and that makes my day. At the end of each day, I\u2019m very satisfied I\u2019ve been able to help them."

English isn\u2019t my first language and it had been more than 20 years since I was in education, so I doubted whether I could go back to university. I wondered if I still had the knowledge and the capacity to cope with the schedule, especially as I was combining it with my job and family life."

I\u2019m nearly qualified now and just waiting to sit my functional skills exams. It\u2019s been exciting and challenging but I\u2019m enjoying it. At the start it was a struggle, because of the doubts I had in myself, but it\u2019s gone very well and been an exciting journey."

My first was in a surgical ward, which was totally different to what I\u2019m used to, because the patients\u2019 needs and our interactions with them are much shorter. Most of them were in for a day and then they\u2019d go home. It\u2019s not like Royal Star & Garter, where you get to know residents over months and years."

I also experienced new ways of working and learned a lot about myself as I moved through my placements. I now realise I\u2019m able to push myself to do things I didn\u2019t think I could before. I\u2019ve conquered my fears and it\u2019s boosted my confidence."

But whatever I do going forward, whether it\u2019s as a NA or registered nurse, I hope it will be with Royal Star & Garter."
