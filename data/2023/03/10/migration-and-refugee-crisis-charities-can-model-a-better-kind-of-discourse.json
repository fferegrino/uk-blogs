            "text": "So long as I am Chair of the Charity Commission, I will stand up for the right of charities to lawfully campaign and indeed I have made a point of stressing this fact since taking on the role nearly a year ago. And I am still doing it now, even while some critics seek to question charities\u2019 campaigning role in the refugee crisis."

            "text": "And so, as a new debate rages about how best to tackle the worldwide migrant crisis, and charities enter that fray, this will only intensify as we approach a general election. \u00a0Charity leaders must remember their responsibilities and avoid inflammatory rhetoric that may undermine public trust in the sector."

            "text": "Charities have an opportunity here \u2013 and I would say a responsibility \u2013 to model a better kind of public discourse. It is on us as a sector to work to reduce the heated frenzy of aggressive debates on public policy. Just as it is on decision-makers to do the same."

As I have said before, Joe Biden led his presidency with the words: \u201cHear one another. See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war\u2026 we have to be different than this.\u201d"
