            "text": "Since 2016, our full inspections have shown that STCs do not provide the quality of care that we expect for children. In some cases, children were at risk of harm. This is simply not good enough for some of the most vulnerable children in our society."

Introducing assurance inspections to STCs, as we have already done in secure children\u2019s homes, is the right thing to do and will give us a better line of sight to children\u2019s day-to-day lives."
