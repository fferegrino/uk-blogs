Most household rubbish gets collected by our local councils as part of their kerbside waste collection services; but what about when you have other \u2013 bigger items to dispose of that can\u2019t be put in your bin?"

These people have no conscience. Their principal aim is to make money, avoiding the environmental regulations put in place to protect our communities, homes, and the greenspaces we and future generations depend on for a healthy, happy life."

Waste criminals know this and utilise social media and online sales platforms to advertise their bogus waste collection services. It\u2019s seemingly so easy. Say for example, you have an old fridge freezer that needs taking away, but it doesn\u2019t fit in your car, so finding a waste collection service online appears to be the perfect solution. It could be fine, but just to be sure it\u2019s not going to end up dumped in a field, playpark, or country lane, there are three simple checks you should make:"

It\u2019s also waste collection mobile apps that act as a platform to connect people who have rubbish to dispose of, with a waste collector. Often those running the waste collection mobile apps make no checks on the waste collection services they advertise and won\u2019t know if your waste has been taken to a legal waste site, despite claiming otherwise."

            "text": "Waste criminals can start small on their own with just a van, but they can quickly grow their business resulting in thousands of tonnes of waste being collected and illegally dumped, causing damage to neighbouring communities and our environment. At the worst end, criminal gangs infiltrate the legitimate waste industry, adding waste crime to their list of other offences, including, drug dealing, firearms, fraud, modern day slavery, and human trafficking."
