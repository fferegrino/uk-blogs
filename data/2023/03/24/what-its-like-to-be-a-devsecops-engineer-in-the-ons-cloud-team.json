My specific focus at the moment is very much around the IDS (Integrated Data Service) platform, its security and automation. I expected to be working on cloud infrastructure, but the pace of delivery and sheer amount of work produced is a lot greater than I expected."

This is important to me, as I do not work from the same office as any of my colleagues in CATD."

ONS is a very big place with complex workstreams all over the place, it will take a long time to gain a deeper contextual understanding of where and how things fit together. Special mention goes to working on GCP when my past experience is all Azure based, though fortunately for me, lots of concepts are similar."

There is also senior leadership presence in these which gives me confidence that information is flowing smoothly in and out of the team. Wider organisational communication is also good, I receive various updates through email and Teams calls, as well as information on the intranet."
