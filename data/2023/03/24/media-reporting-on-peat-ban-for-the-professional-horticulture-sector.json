In 2011 we agreed to a voluntary phase out of the sale of peat and peat-containing products by 2020, and repeatedly stated that we would legislate if this was not successful. While progress was made, the industry transition has been too slow. Therefore, in August 2022, we announced a ban\u00a0on the sale of\u00a0peat\u00a0and peat-containing products in the retail\u00a0horticultural sector by 2024."

There are already many peat alternatives on the market including bark, coir, bracken which have been well adopted in the amateur sector. Defra has jointly funded research with the industry on peat replacements in professional horticulture, the results of which are promising. Indeed sectors such as strawberries and other soft fruit growers have already transitioned away from peat-based growing media."

This week we set out further details to the professional horticultural sector and our expectations for a phased reduction in the use of peat with a date of 2026 - allowing for\u00a0certain technical exemptions \u2013 with a complete ban from 2030."
