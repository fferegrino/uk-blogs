In my Step Up programme cohort there were people from all different fields, with so many different skills, so we learnt a lot from each other too. These skills were all transferable and applicable to social work too."

I found my second placement quite tough at some points but thankfully I had a great team manager who helped me through the tougher times and I felt like I could lean on them for support when I needed it.\u00a0 As a student you may not always feel confident to speak up but it\u2019s so important to make sure you do. You will constantly be advocating for your young people and families so make sure you also do for yourself!"
