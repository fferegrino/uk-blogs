            "text": "I started working for the ONS in January, but my first experience in the Civil Service was when I began working at the Cabinet Office in 2020. Before that, I spent 25 years in the private sector, with the last 13 years running my own company. Our focus was on big data installations, particularly in data warehousing for West End theatres. My own expertise comes from database administration rather than data science or analysis, so I\u2019m definitely more hands-on from the school of data management and design."

            "text": "Like many others, unfortunately, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on my business, as our clients were unable to operate. I had already established connections with the Government Digital Service (GDS) while discussing Application Programming Interface (API) Standards. So I was aware of its plans to expand and create the Data Standards Authority (DSA) and I joined the team to support the initiative."
        },
        {
            "text": "Over time, the DSA\u2019s responsibilities evolved into part of the Data Strategy and Standards Directorate within the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO). This led to the creation of an official data architecture team, which I ran."
        },
        {
            "text": "Since GDS and the ONS established the DSA together, I\u2019d always worked closely with the ONS. I was involved in various projects, such as the Reference Data Management Framework and the design authority for the Integrated Data Service (IDS). When I saw the vacancy at the ONS, I couldn't resist the opportunity to apply my knowledge and experience to a larger scale."

        {
            "text": "There are already many great things happening at the ONS, but not everyone is aware of it. We have ambitious plans for data integration and linkage that no other government team can match. That\u2019s down to the sheer size of the ONS and the volume of data we deal with."
        },
        {
            "text": "I also want to partner with CDDO to put their data policies into practice, at scale. We want to push forward data standards, develop the metadata model, and contribute to the data marketplace. The ONS is where we can turn theory into reality and show people what this will look like and what benefits they\u2019ll drive."

            "text": "I want to add value by helping to ensure the team is plugged into the cross-government communities around data. We will lead by example, share knowledge, and look for ways to join up and promote all the innovative and exciting stuff happening in other data rich departments."
