            "text": "Nutrient pollution is an urgent problem for freshwater habitats and estuaries which provide a vital home to many species including wetland birds, fish, and insects. Increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can disrupt natural processes and harm wildlife. We know that nature is fundamental to human health and prosperity, so impacts are felt by all of us in society."

            "text": "The government has already taken significant action to tackle this problem. However, in some catchments, pollutant levels in recent years have reached critical levels that require additional intervention to ensure that Local Planning Authorities can have confidence in permitting new housing. 74 Local Planning Authorities have been advised that future development may need to be nutrient neutral. We recognise the challenges this creates for developers in additional costs and delays on development and Natural England is very focussed on working with the sector to find solutions."

Government set us a unique challenge to establish a working scheme within eight months from scratch. I\u2019d like to sincerely thank the amazing Natural England team leading this work as well as the long list of partners and stakeholders who have supported us and enabled us to rapidly to set up a scheme that we can all have confidence in. Defra and DLUHC are investing up to \u00a330 million to fast track the delivery of nutrient mitigation in affected areas through, for example, creating new wetlands to 'soak up\u2019 or mitigate the impacts of unavoidable nutrient pollution."

These upgrades will reduce the pollution burden from housing in sensitive areas and reduce the amount of mitigation required by developers."

The outcome of these studies will inform the pipeline of sites that Natural England will invest in to generate the next nutrient credit rounds."

Natural England recognise this and have developed a strategy where temporary mitigation solutions are utilised to bridge the gap between when a wetland is commissioned and when it becomes functional, therefore allowing planning permissions to be granted sooner."

The new Nutrient Mitigation Scheme is a great example of how we can both deliver nature recovery and support sustainable development. With its launch in the Tees, we are at the start of a period of collaboration with partners and customers where we innovate in order to achieve nature recovery and sustainable development.\nDelivering nutrient neutrality can only be an interim solution. Government has taken significant action to tackle pollution at source and restore our protected sites and is committed to going further to meet environmental targets. Government is also providing greater funding, certainty and support to enable developers to meet mitigation requirements in the short term. Natural England will continue to work in partnership with government, farmers, land managers, Local Authorities and business to restore our rivers so that they can play their full part in nature recovery and our own health and prosperity."
