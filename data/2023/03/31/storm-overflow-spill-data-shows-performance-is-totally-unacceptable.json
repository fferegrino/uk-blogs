Despite claims by water companies and Water UK, the body that represents their interests, there is no evidence to show it is because of water company action. In fact, last year water companies only made improvements to 65 storm overflows \u2013 less than 0.5% of the overall total of overflows in the entire system \u2013 so we are very confident that water company action has not significantly contributed to the reduction in flows overall. For them to claim otherwise is wilfully misleading."

The number of overflows monitored across the network has increased from 10% in 2015 to more than 91% in 2022. By the end of the year, 100% of storm overflows should have an Event Duration Monitor installed. This means we can all see the true extent of storm overflow spills, and the Environment Agency and government can direct water company investment to stop it."
