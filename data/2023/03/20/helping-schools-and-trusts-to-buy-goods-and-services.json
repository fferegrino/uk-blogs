            "text": "Get help buying for schools is a service delivered by the Department for Education, which helps schools to buy goods and services. Our aim is to support schools and trusts to buy well, and have peace of mind that they are getting good value in terms of cost, quality and time."

            "text": "We are here to support schools and trusts to buy everything from energy, ICT and catering, to transport, legal services and furniture \u2013 and much more. In fact, we have over 60 DfE-approved frameworks which can be accessed via the Find a Framework tool on GOV.UK. We also have our own team of in-house procurement experts, who are able to recommend bespoke solutions if a school or trust has a specific need."
        },
        {
            "text": "We offer different levels of service. We have online advice and guidance, we signpost to DfE-approved frameworks which offer a massive range of good and services for schools, and we provide a more hands on service to help schools or trusts with more complex procurements. The service is free of charge to state funded schools."
        },
        {
            "text": "We understand that not all schools or trusts currently employ a procurement specialist and that buying is often undertaken by someone who is wearing many hats, and that for many schools, buying the high cost/high risk goods and services is a complex and resource intensive process. Schools tell us they are inundated with marketing materials, calls and emails, day in day out, and in many cases tend to stick with incumbent suppliers because it sometimes feels like the safest option, even if it doesn\u2019t always deliver the best value. We want to give schools the support and confidence to look at other alternatives that could either save them money, time or deliver them a better service \u2013 that\u2019s what Get help buying for schools is about."

            "text": "The service is centred around a desire to drive the best procurement outcomes for schools. Being able to help schools buy goods and services better gives me and my team a great sense of satisfaction. Every time we save money and time for a school, we know this directly supports improved educational outcomes, and that\u2019s what motivates us."

User research and feedback are vital to how we develop and improve our service. What is clear, even so early on, is how much schools value the time we save them, not just the money. We have that at the front of our minds as we continue to develop the service."

            "text": "We are very keen to develop stronger relationships with our supply chains and partners. DfE have a range of approved frameworks we can utilise with many of the well know public sector buying organisations. We meet monthly as a rule, and more often if required due to particular issues in the market. Energy is the obvious example, where due to market pressures it is really important to stay close with our supply chain partners to make sure we have the best options, guidance and solutions available. Supply chain resilience is important, and we want schools to feel confident that when they work with us, we are offering the best long-term solutions and suppliers. Bringing together our knowledge and that of our partners helps us to do this."

            "text": "We\u2019ve worked with a wide range of schools and trusts so far. One of the best ways school buyers can help us to help them is to get in early and plan ahead, because complex procurements can take months rather than weeks. Schools and trusts will have their own internal approval processes that also need factoring in to the timescales, so you really can\u2019t start planning too early. The more time we have to work through options for new contracts, the better the outcomes will be."

            "text": "Detail is also important. The more detail we have in terms of specifics up front, the easier it is to advise on the best route to market and the process to deliver what the school or trust needs. Having a clear and detailed specification of your requirements will help us advise you on your best options."
        },
        {
            "text": "We have frameworks we can utilise but we can also run bespoke, standalone procurements if it is the best fit for a school or trust.\u00a0A lot of school business professionals are put off by frameworks, they can seem complicated and clunky if you\u2019ve not used them before. But schools can save a lot of time using a framework. They are a legally compliant route to market, there is no need to shop around to get three quotes and you have peace of mind you are meeting the relevant procurement regulations. Plus, they can deliver good value for money."

            "text": "The service is still relatively new, but we are already seeing financial and time savings for schools, and that is something we are proud of. In the future, I\u2019d also like to see us calculating social value benefits from our procurements, so that schools can get a real sense of the whole value they get from working with us. I\u2019m really excited by the \u2018whole value\u2019 proposition that we can create for schools."
