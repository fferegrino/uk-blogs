            "text": "Plant passporting originated in 1993 as an EU initiative to ensure traceability and assurance around the movement of plants within the EU. To help address the challenges of online trading, the EU\u2019s plant health legislation was updated in 2019 to include the regulation of distance contracts (including online sales, mail-orders, and direct-to-customer trade)."

            "text": "Following the UK leaving the EU the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), introduced a UK plant passporting scheme. This scheme \u00a0requires any professional plant supplier (professional operator) in England or Wales selling plants by distance contract, or to other professional operators within Great Britain, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, to issue plant passports. To do this, professional operators must register on APHA\u2019s database and then apply for authorisation, Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar schemes."
        },
        {
            "text": "Once authorised, the professional operator becomes an authorised operator (AO) and can then attach a plant passporting label (the plant passport) for each plant or batch of plants, which must travel with the plants. This means that if a pest or disease is found, APHA can easily and quickly trace all relevant plants to reduce the risk of an outbreak."

        {
            "text": "APHA staff perform audits of AOs each year. As part of this, AOs need to demonstrate that they know where their plants have come from and where they have gone. They should also be able to show that they are aware of any risks associated with the plants they are trading and take steps to mitigate them."
