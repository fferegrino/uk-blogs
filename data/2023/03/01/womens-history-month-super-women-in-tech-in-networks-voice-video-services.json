I worked as the Head of Systems previously, which was my first role within the tech industry. Prior to, I was the Quality Assurance Lead within the CRC and worked as a Probation Service Officer directly before. My background has always been people focused and service improvement led. I never thought I\u2019d work in tech, let alone enjoy it as much as I do."

Working within Justice Digital is the perfect home to combine my passion for people and tech, getting it right makes a huge difference to the people we serve, and I believe that is embedded within the culture here."

I then spent the next 2.5 years working as an Infrastructure Engineer installing, configuring and maintaining physical and virtual network devices. Working in this role helped me develop strong technical and business acumen, while meeting business requirements."

There are vast learning opportunities here, through training, getting hands-on experience and shadowing others. I also enjoy working with such a diverse team who are resourceful and have a great work ethics."

I decided to switch careers and joined the Civil Service Fast Stream on the Digital Stream. I worked in a variety of roles and departments, but loved the challenge of technical services and product management."

            "text": "I like how tangible it is that my work will help someone going through the courts or prison, so to do a good job will mean that a user barely notices the tech they are interacting with. Video services have been in the media recently too, and in a very positive light about the visibility of justice and how helpful it is to have different ways to access the courts - so it's a refreshing change!"
