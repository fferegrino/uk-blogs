Our work has included the introduction of a voluntary no anchor zone at Studland, to protect the seagrass habitat and the species that it supports from the damage caused by the dropping and weighing of anchors. A designated protected feature of the Studland Bay Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ), we want to ensure that marine activities, such as boating at this popular destination, can continue in a sustainable way.\u00a0 \u00a0"
