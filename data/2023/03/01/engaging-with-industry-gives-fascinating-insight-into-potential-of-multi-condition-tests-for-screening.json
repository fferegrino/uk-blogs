The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) has many important questions to consider before it could recommend using this very different kind of test and technology in a national screening programme."

Their products ranged from ones yet to be fully developed to those being used in research trials involving thousands of recruited volunteers. The products also used a wide range of distinct and interesting scientific approaches."
