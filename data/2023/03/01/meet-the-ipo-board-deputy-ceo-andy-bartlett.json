That involved going to court and advising counsel to try to get clarity on the law and the way that we implement it in the UK. This was hugely challenging because it was really important to our customers who were trying to get protection that they might have been able to get in other countries. Unsurprisingly, they couldn't understand why they couldn't get it in the UK."
