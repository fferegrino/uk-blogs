            "text": "Of the many challenges we face as a society, there is no doubt mental health has become one of the most pressing. Between 2016 to 2021, statistics show there was a 44% increase in referrals to NHS mental health services. The national charity, Rethink Mental Illness, reported a 175% increase in demand for advice and information on their website in the year following the lockdown."

            "text": "In some ways, I don\u2019t find these figures surprising. As someone who has at times struggled with mental health issues, I know first hand how the last two years have made things more difficult. I also know, from talking to friends and family, I am not alone."
        },
        {
            "text": "Unsurprisingly, the NHS and other forms of support are finding responding to this rising demand challenging. A big problem is the lack of community-based alternatives to bed-based care, where people can go if they need support."

        {
            "text": "In the worst cases, people get \u201ctrapped\u201d in hospital or enter totally unsuitable accommodation. This is where Shared Lives can play a role. Best known for the support it provides to adults with learning disabilities, it\u2019s a model of care which involves a Shared Lives carer sharing their home with a person who needs support. It is a model proving increasingly effective in supporting people with mental health conditions."
        },
        {
            "text": "Why? Because Shared Lives offers a person a loving home to live in, companionship and a wider network of support, which can help them recover and regain their wellbeing. This is, sadly, not always the experience of people who spend a long time in hospital, or live in impersonal supported housing."
