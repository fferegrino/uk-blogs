In addition, Carers Trust research released for Young Carers Action Day has revealed a significant intensification for many young carers with 56% saying the amount of time they spend caring has increased in the past year, and 47% saying they are now caring for more people than before.\u201d"

What young carers told Carers Trust was that it doesn\u2019t need to be this way. They think the things that would make them feel less overwhelmed, healthier and happier include improved support in schools, more access to breaks and better access to counselling support."
