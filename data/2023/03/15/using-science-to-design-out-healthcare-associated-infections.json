In this blog Ginny Moore \u2013 an expert in applied environmental microbiology research \u2013\u00a0looks at our work to help hospitals prevent the spread of infections, which involves working with both hospitals and academic partners."

As a microbiologist, it\u2019s rewarding to know that the work we do informs front-line policy and practice and ultimately keeps patients and healthcare professionals safe."
