This will be an opportunity at GDS to champion our own neurodiverse talent and find out how we can work together to leverage it and at the same time level up for everyone in the organisation."

            "text": "I was first inspired to re-evaluate my dyslexia as a positive when I went on a Civil Service Fast Stream secondment to neurodiversity employment advocacy organisation Exceptional Individuals. Working closely with the organisation's founder Matt Boyd, I learned to re-frame common misconceptions in society that I had previously internalised about my own neurodiversity and advocate it to others. This experience was so powerful and transformative that colleagues in the Cabinet Office Press Office proactively pushed a piece out to the Financial Times about my experiences."

            "text": "One year ago I decided to put effort into building the network and formalising it, as I felt there was so much neurodiverse potential in our organisation which we hadn\u2019t yet tapped into. What I saw all around me at GDS motivated me to change things. I once had a colleague open up to me and tell me they were dyslexic only on their last day. I realised from instances like this that more work needed to be done to ensure people at GDS were able to feel open about their neurodiversity, and supported from day one. This will ensure we harness the neurodiverse superpowers we have at our disposal to solve the challenging user problems we face. "

But there is still more work to do as studies by the National Career Institute\u00a0suggest the overall neurodiverse population is close to 20%. The network runs a rich programme of events and leads on key work streams to leverage neurodiversity right across the organisation and those close to it."

At GDS we celebrate neurodiversity over a whole month to maximise involvement across the staff body. This year we will be covering the strategy we have developed, with a big focus on trialling \u2018Manual about Me\u2019 across the business. We have already incorporated \u2018Manual about Me\u2019 into the GDS Smarter working toolkit. During the events this month we will seek to promote widespread testing and trialling of them across delivery and product communities. Some Delivery and Product managers are already using \u2018Manual about Me\u2019 and we are working closely with them to help promote trialling of it across the organisation."
