There were times when I\u2019d come into work in the morning feeling like I\u2019d run a marathon because my sister had a meltdown the night before. Other times, I would be distracted from work because I was worrying so much about the problems back home. My team responded in a human, not a corporate way. My experience since then has been extremely positive.\u00a0"

However, having that extra responsibility when you\u2019re young impacts every part of your life \u2013 your ambitions, your career, your social life and the way you imagine your future. This is at a time when you\u2019re meant to be carefree and discovering who you are. But you also learn a huge amount about empathy, compassion, prioritisation and the ability to appreciate the little things in life."
