            "text": "Spring has sprung and with warming rivers and streams, coarse fish are preparing for the spawning season. On rivers this is the \u2018close season\u2019 for angling and takes place from March 15th to June 15th inclusive. This three-month closure is a really important time for fish. Many will be preparing to spawn, are spawning or recovering from spawning - adult fish, emerging eggs and juvenile fish or fry are all vulnerable.\u00a0 This can be both stressful and exhausting for fish but also a precarious time for eggs that are largely exposed and unprotected. Giving them this time to spawn, undisturbed by anglers, recover - and, in the case of eggs, develop - is a vital helping hand and something our fisheries officers will enforce and protect."

            "text": "For some anglers, the close season offers a chance to hang up their rods for a short time and for others, it provides an opportunity to mix up their routine and switch to those canal and lake fisheries not covered by the statutory close season. Some may even dust off their trout rod. I am an angler myself and fish a variety of venues across the country.\u00a0 I\u2019m a traditionalist at heart and really value fishing small rivers and the fenland drains, but I\u2019m not sorry when my river fishing pauses in spring. This gives me a chance to try new venues, like the fantastic canal network and my local country park lakes as well as maintain my kit ready for the new season."

Our work not only protects the sport but enhances the wider work we deliver to enhance fisheries and promote fishing. Some of the most valuable work we do links to improving opportunities for fish to spawn which strengthens fish stocks naturally.\u00a0 Improving spawning habitat (and creating new habitat) and access to it (through the construction of fish passes), and protecting where fish spawn is vital to encouraging strong stocks and better fisheries."

            "text": "Spawning habitat is so important to protecting fish stocks that the law, under Section 2 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1975, actually protects fish and their eggs at this stage from disturbance and damage, from both angling and other activities. Anyone carrying out work in rivers that disturbs spawning fish, their eggs or their spawning grounds could be committing an offence."

You don\u2019t have to stop fishing entirely and could, like me, use the time as an opportunity to try something new. Trout fishing, for example, is also covered by your coarse and non-migratory trout fishing rod licence. These fisheries still provide a great chance of an excellent catch without breaking any rules."
