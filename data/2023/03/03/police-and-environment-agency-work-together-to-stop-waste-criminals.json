As a team we see the real benefit in sharing our work online with images of the agencies working together, so that the public can see for themselves that the Environment Agency and the police are out there dealing with these offenders."

That person was found guilty at court of waste offences and criminal damage and received over \u00a35000 in fines."

We are very proud of the relationship we have, and we look forward to working together as we continue to enhance the service we deliver. It\u2019s by being able to pick up the phone and talk to colleagues who have a shared interest and passion to tackle this issue, that we are filled with confidence to face this problem head on."
