Given the size and scale of the NHS delegation of responsibility for the creation of identities has been given to a Registration Authority (RA) which is a formally recognised role in an NHS Organisation. The RA can currently register an identity either face to face or over a video conference capability. The video conference capability was introduced temporarily via the COPI notice to support the response to the pandemic. It\u2019s been helpful however as a sub-optimal solution that\u2019s subject to quality of cameras and screenshots and photos of artefacts being submitted."

This is to replace the current emergency policy and is to be aimed at staff who are remote to the location of an RA organisation thereby saving time that could be spent on clinical activities. This will also support new use cases where HCPs will be required to access NHS systems but where there is no RA infrastructure and funding in place to support RA based registration. For example, dentistry, optometry and some care settings."
