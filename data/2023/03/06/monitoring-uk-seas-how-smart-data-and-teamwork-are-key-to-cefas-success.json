To celebrate International Open Data Day on March 5th, Cefas scientists, Michelle Devlin, Chris Read, Naomi Greenwood and Paul Nelson tell us about their work under the UK Marine Eutrophication Monitoring Programme, which monitors water quality in UK seas. They talk about the importance of teamwork, and the challenges and rewards of working with real-time data collected by Cefas SmartBuoys and the RV Cefas Endeavour research vessel."

They are deployed on surveys four times a year by our research vessel, the RV Cefas\u00a0Endeavour. We currently have three located across the UK and they collect real-time data on a range of things, from the salt content, temperature, turbidity, oxygen levels, chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate concentration. Water samples are also collected and preserved onboard for later analysis of nutrients and phytoplankton species. \u00a0"

This work has led to smaller and more power efficient equipment with greater reliability and versatility.
