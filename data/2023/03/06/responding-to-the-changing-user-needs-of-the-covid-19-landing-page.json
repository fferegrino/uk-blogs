Throughout the height of the pandemic it was regularly updated to respond to user needs. Alongside rolling announcements and signposts to help users find guidance and support, we also built things like a timeline showing when and where rule changes would come into effect and an interactive data dashboard with infection and hospitalisation numbers."

This drop in satisfaction suggests that, where coronavirus is concerned, users want to be guided a little more directly. After all, this is what they became used to during the pandemic."
