National Social Work Week, incorporating World Social Work Day, gives us an extended opportunity to reflect on recent history, assess the current state of our practice and ask the question \u2018What next for modern, progressive, person-centred social work?\u2019"

The last three years of lockdowns, illegal wars and economic or natural born crises (at home and abroad), have \u2018stress tested\u2019 our skills and experience as never before. If we are not needed at times of intense personal challenge then when are we?"

While you can\u2019t really improve on face to face interactions, we nonetheless maintained positive online connections with those we support and with our peers and professional counterparts in the wider health and care system."

The debate we must now have is this: to what extent can we use it to enhance and expand our approach to supporting individuals, families and communities? The webinar will explore how technology improves the lives of those drawing on care and support and how we might similarly augment our person-centred approach."

For existing social workers, I hope the week brings them further validation in the amazing work they do. For those new to the profession, or in training, I believe it will inspire, motivate and expand their creative horizons."
