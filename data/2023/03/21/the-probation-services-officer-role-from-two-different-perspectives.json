            "text": "Pavenpreet: The work is largely face-to-face appointments, then updating records, dealing with referrals, information gathering, that sort of thing. I would say it\u2019s a different challenge every day, dealing with different people, with different needs. Some simple, some not. You might plan a to-do list, but you\u2019ll end up doing something completely different. There\u2019s never a boring day."
        },

            "text": "Georgie: It\u2019s quite varied. It\u2019s completely new to me. There\u2019ll be appointments, reports, different issues with different people. Housing issues to sort, home visits to make. Each day is quite different. It\u2019s a lot at first but you soon learn to get the balance right and it works pretty well."

            "text": "Pavenpreet: It\u2019s just about helping others really, it\u2019s as simple as that. I have a policing background, it\u2019s in the family \u2013 my grandfather was a policeman and I studied criminology. So my interest in the job started during my studies. For me it\u2019s about helping people in the community and protecting the public."

            "text": "Georgie: I worked in a gym before and it wasn\u2019t very fulfilling, I was just on the front desk. But I was interested in people\u2019s lives and how I could make a difference. I watched lots of YouTube videos and saw a woman who was a probation officer talking about her job and it sounded fascinating."

The assessment was fine \u2013 there was a written element and an interview \u2013 I found it alright to be fair. The written bit was harder for me as I\u2019m not my best with words. But it was all well laid out and I got there in the end."

            "text": "Pavenpreet: Being able to make a difference to people\u2019s lives is really important and it\u2019s what I find so rewarding about the job.\u00a0 Seeing people get help and move away from a life of crime \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get much better than that. It is very satisfying. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve stayed so long. It\u2019s fulfilling on lots of different levels."
        },
        {
            "text": "Georgie: So far, it\u2019s working with people who do actually want to change their path, they don\u2019t want to be involved with the lifestyle they\u2019ve been in before, they want help to take their life in a more positive direction. Getting the opportunity to help facilitate that is very uplifting and powerful."

            "text": "Georgie: At the beginning I was quite stressed but now I\u2019ve really learned how to balance my time. The training is great, and you\u2019re very well supported and learn a lot on the job. You can\u2019t do everything in one day and knowing that is important."
