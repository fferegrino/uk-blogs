            "text": "As announced last year, the UK government has acted alongside its international allies to introduce new measures that will prevent Russia from accessing UK trust services. Enforcement agencies suggest there is evidence of UK-based trust and company service providers offering their services to persons to enable them to reduce the impact of sanctions in the event they become subject to them. This forms part of the strongest sanctions regime ever introduced in the UK."

Today, on 21st March 2023, the 1730 persons that are currently designated under Regulation 11 (asset freeze) of the Regulations are now also designated under Regulation 18C (trust services). This means that it is now prohibited to provide trust services to or for the benefit of these persons, unless permitted by a licence or there is an applicable exception. FCDO\u2019s UK Sanctions List and OFSI\u2019s Consolidated List have been updated to reflect this."

This is effective from the date of designation for the purposes of Regulation 18C of the person to whom the trust services are being provided. For example, for persons designated today on 21st March 2023, the permission to wind down provision of these services will expire at 23:59 on 18th June 2023. Anyone using the General Licence must report to OFSI within 30 calendar days of undertaking any activity under the General Licence. Reporting must include the details of the trust services provided, amongst other things, and evidence should be provided where applicable, and can be completed using this form."

To ensure that this new measure can be implemented effectively in the OTs, we have made an Order in Council. OTs can issue General Licences with the consent of the Foreign Secretary and a number of OTs may want to mirror OFSI\u2019s General Licence."

            "text": "OFSI\u2019s updated Russia guidance also provides clarity on how the trust services sanctions interact with other existing sanctions, such as sanctions on professional and business services. Further to that, it confirms that all sanctions on professional and business services continue to apply even when trust services are permitted, unless the professional or business service is permitted by a licence in respect of that professional or business service or there is an applicable exception from the professional or business services sanction."
