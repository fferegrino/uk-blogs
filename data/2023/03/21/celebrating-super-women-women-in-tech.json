Working in an operational role, facing the public gave me my first experience of understanding the true impact on the business if the systems and process did not work. I then moved to the Lord Chancellors department and spent 7 years working for the Judge Advocate General's Office overseeing the Court Martial System."

I joined the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) scheme on the Civil Service Fast Stream where I started out as a product manager in Defra working on building their career pathways to support colleagues to upskill. Prior to that I worked outside tech: having studied History and Law \u2013 possibly one of the furthest things from tech you get \u2013 before moving into teaching and then project coordination in the international trade sector."

It is a very welcoming space with so many opportunities to develop yourself not only through formal training but also in the work that you can choose to take on \u2013 the scope for forging your path and making an impact is huge."
