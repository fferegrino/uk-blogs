Yet at the same time, trying to replicate these settings in the lab is cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive."

            "text": "It sounds a bit nerdy, but we all feel quite strongly that policy should, as far as possible, be evidence based; I guess this is part of the public service ethos that attracted each of us to our respective jobs in Government. This way, getting involved in the Data Challenge has been a great opportunity to support an aspect of the government\u2019s work that we really care about. Our idea is definitely out of the box \u2013 something really interesting to get involved in, with the potential to genuinely change how we generate the data that informs policy making; we really feel like we\u2019re breaking new ground and it\u2019s exciting!"

We\u2019ve all got very demanding day jobs, so carving out the time to put the hours in to refine our idea has been tough. On the other hand, it\u2019s been very rewarding to work on a project with a lot of creative freedom, something we truly own, in an innovate area.\u00a0"
