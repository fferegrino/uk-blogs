            "text": "Much like its 19th century namesake Elizabeth Heyrick, Project Heyrick aims to change how the UK detects modern slavery using a modern data-driven approach. By collecting public & private data from across government and from open source, and analysing it for indicators of modern slavery, Project Heyrick will provide proactive intervention targets so that enforcement departments, such as Policing, the Home Office or the National Crime Agency, can more effectively identify potential cases of modern slavery without the victim needing to present themselves.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "As in many cases today victims of modern slavery often do not even realise that they are slaves.\u00a0 Thousands of slaves go undetected every year, but Heyrick can help massively by finding the victims, identifying the perpetrators, and also helping the enforcement agencies optimise the use of resources and bring criminals to justice more efficiently."

It\u2019s challenging to coordinate work between team members in multiple departments who are juggling their main job with the Data Challenge, but that\u2019s also why we work well, we understand each other\u2019s challenges and step forward to share the work. Also, because we all come from different areas of government, we bring different perspectives & expertise to the table helping us create a rounded winning solution."

I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet incredible people doing amazing work across the Civil Service, the chance to present the idea in front of the judges, and the pleasure of working alongside Civil Servants from an array of departments."

Also, when I heard that one of the judges was happy to be our sponsor it gave me a further boost, to have that kind of backing really means something to the team and has helped us massively in gaining attention and support in areas which were new to me.\u00a0 My manager, colleagues & friends are thrilled for me! I\u2019m very grateful to have their support going into the final."
