Through increasing accuracy, reducing fraud, and resolving changes more quickly, our system will be fairer and we hope to build greater trust with our customers. We have also identified further opportunities for DWP to better utilise HMRC data."

Plus, I was also weirdly attracted to or intrigued by the Dragons Den style format!\u00a0\u00a0"

In-person sessions have really helped, as has pulling in wider expertise to support us. We work well together as we all bring different skills and perspectives. For example, John\u2019s knowledge of both HMRC and DWP digital systems has been invaluable. We\u2019re sometimes guilty of getting stuck in the weeds, but we coalesce around our aims to make things better for our colleagues and customers, as well as sharing our longer term transformational goals for how DWP and HMRC could work better together."
