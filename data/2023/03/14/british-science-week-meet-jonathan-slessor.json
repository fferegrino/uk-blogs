We also asked them for some of their top tips on how we can be more sustainable in our day-to-day lives."

To begin with, would you mind sharing some information on your background? In particular, what have you done in the past and what does your scientific background look like?"

            "text": "So, with that background and wealth of experience in a whole host of different areas, I think it\u2019s fair to say that you could have ended up focusing on anything. What made you choose to work in Climate Change and Sustainability? "

            "text": "Let\u2019s change track slightly now and move into the present day. Could you explain how your background and the experiences you\u2019ve already mentioned, influence how you approach your current work in CC&S? "
