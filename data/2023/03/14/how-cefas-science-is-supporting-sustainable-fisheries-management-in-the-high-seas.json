            "text": "The High Seas are areas of the ocean beyond any country's territorial control and make up almost two thirds of the world\u2019s oceans. These areas are at a greater risk of exploitation as countries are able to move, fish and carry out scientific research without any sanctions. In an attempt to manage fishing within these areas, countries with fishing interests in a geographical area come together to form Regional Fisheries Management Organizations and Administrations (RFMO/As). Most RFMOs have management powers to set catch and fishing effort limits, technical measures, and control obligations in an attempt to regulate fishing activities in areas of the high seas.\u00a0\u00a0"

This month, after almost 14 years of discussions, representatives from 193 member states agreed to a High Seas Treaty which aims to protect the High Seas. \u00a0The Treaty will build on the work of RMFOs in supporting marine conservation and management and will be key to achieving the UN\u2019s new 10-year strategy for nature conservation that aims to protect and conserve at least 30% of Earth\u2019s coastal and marine areas by 2030 (known as the \u201c30 by 30 target\u201d)\u00a0"

            "text": "Overfishing is a huge challenge facing many areas of our oceans. Scientists from Cefas have been working with the RFMO for the Northwest Atlantic (NAFO) to create and apply an ecosystem approach since 2009.\u00a0 The ecosystem approach considers nature as a system and looks at everything as interconnected and interdependent. We don't just focus on a single species or a single problem, but we try to understand how all the different pieces fit together. For example, a change in one part of the ecosystem can have a big impact on everything else. One of the guiding principles of the recent NAFO approach is that the total catches at the ecosystem level should not exceed the rate at which the ecosystem can regenerate. This is known as the Total Catch Index (TCI). By taking the ecosystem approach, NAFO are working to ensure that fish stocks are sustained, that vulnerable marine species and habitats are protected, and ecosystem overfishing is prevented.\u00a0\u00a0"

This is the first time that an RFMO in the High Seas has established such an advisory limit.\u00a0"

            "text": "Unregulated bottom trawling is another challenge facing the high seas. Bottom trawling is known to have a huge impact on ocean biodiversity due to the physical damage it causes to the seafloor and as the method is largely indiscriminate in what it catches. Bottom trawling often has high levels of bycatch. The Cefas team, along with colleagues from other NAFO member countries, have worked together to develop ways to understand and calculate the loss of biodiversity caused by bottom trawling activities (scs20-23 WG-ESA Report Nov 2020 (nafo.int)). This scientific evidence has supported the closure of all seamounts to bottom fishing activities at fishable depths in the Northwest Atlantic and protecting over 90% of the sponge biomass located within the NAFO Regulatory Area subject to fishing activity. \u00a0"
