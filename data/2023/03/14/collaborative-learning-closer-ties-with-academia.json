The Cabinet Office offers many avenues for productive collaboration, enabling internal and external partners to develop both professionally and personally. This includes up to 5 days of special paid leave per year for volunteering activity, cross-government programmes such as the catapult and accelerator schemes, and external collaborations such as the Teach Her mentorship; aimed at mentoring diverse women seeking career opportunities in DDaT.\u00a0"

Successfully determining this holds the potential to facilitate access to government digital services and improve the overall experience of our users."

We quickly progressed onto subject matter training, providing resources on Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis. Over the course of their work, the students made use of named entity recognition and geometric deep learning using biased second order random walks."

They developed and presented a set of project proposals to internal experts and stakeholders receiving feedback and direction. Whilst working on their projects we held regular stand ups to assess progress and blockers, embracing the AGILE expectations of failing fast and iterating on an initial product. At this point I must praise the students for their ability to diligently work on this project whilst balancing their prior commitments; dissertations, exams, and parallel work experiences. The resilience and dedication they demonstrated throughout this period was exemplary and makes me proud to have been a part of our collaboration.\u00a0"

Moreover, it is a great opportunity to meet new people, and to get insight into how the Civil Service operates. Not only will you be able to hone your coding and research skills, but it will allow you to experience real world data-science!\u201d"
