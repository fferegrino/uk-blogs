Over the past year, I have been working closely with Blake Morgan\u2019s post-completion team to ensure its often highly complex land registration cases are processed as smoothly and easily as possible. As a result, Blake Morgan has one of the lowest avoidable requisition rates in the sector and, as Head of Post-Completion Jade Watson herself says below, this saves the firm a lot of money."

            "text": "I\u2019m very focused on the quality of Blake Morgan\u2019s applications to HM Land Registry (HMLR) and for me, the starting point is our published requisition rates. As well as going through them in detail with Ollie, I look at them myself on a bi-monthly basis, interpret the data and review what\u2019s happening, before filtering issues through to individuals. If it\u2019s a training point, we\u2019ll work on it. I run workshops as well as other training in-house, and encourage staff to join HMLR\u2019s webinars, which I also attend. They are good and, wherever possible, I give feedback to help make them even better!"

For them, my team is a second pair of eyes \u2013 and vice versa. We have a really good relationship with staff across our five offices and I\u2019m always available for consultation or advice on what I think HMLR will accept \u2013 and what they won\u2019t."

In return, they know they can rely on the post-completion team to ensure their applications are the best they possibly can be on lodgement with HMLR."

Our fee earners take these into account during the drafting process, then the post-completion team checks everything again and resolves any issues before submitting the application. Sometimes, this means tackling anomalies in documents sent by other law firms and making sure they have the authority to make changes."

If an application is perfect at the time of submission, however, it means they don\u2019t have to worry about it again. There\u2019s no chasing, no checking if we\u2019ve reached the four-week deadline for response, no fear of cancellation \u2013 altogether far less work for all of us."

Recently, I submitted a lease application using DRS which sailed through with no complications \u2013 all done and dusted in six months. I was very impressed."
