            "text": "The Disability Working Group (DWG) is led by David Kenyon who is based in the Scottish Government. Over the past year we have had joint priorities. First, to promote the use of the employee passport which is fundamental in making initial conversations with new line managers and colleagues easier and ensuring workplace adjustments are in place ahead of someone starting a new role. Secondly, we wanted to spotlight the lived experiences of disabled colleagues focusing on both the issues and barriers that they have faced but also in many cases how easy these would or have been to overcome."

We run a series of events focusing on improving representation across government and develop links with other cross government networks to increase collaboration efforts and our visibility. With more volunteers we could extend our programme of events and a more ambitious programme."

In its most basic definition, social mobility refers to the link between our starting point in life, and where we end up (State of the Nation 2022, Social Mobility Commission). The range and roles available within government science are not always visible, so we aim to break down barriers to accessing relevant information and enable true social mobility. To achieve these goals, the SMWG would like to start information exchanges, support, and mentorship to members of the profession. So far, our members have identified they would like to take part in school outreach and raising awareness of entry to further education schemes as attainable goals to champion. We would also like to send regular guides, links to training and mentorship through our newsletters and group support meetings."

We currently run a calendar of cross-government \u201cInspiring Women in STEM\u201d virtual talks, with highlights in 2022 including a talk by Dr Shabana Haque, OBE (Deputy Director of Research Infrastructure in the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy) for International Women in Engineering Day (INWED) and a special conversation with Professor Christine Maggs (Chief Scientist of Joint Nature Conservation Committee) as we said farewell and thank you for her many years of service as Chair of our working group. This year, we had the pleasure of hosting Professor Sarah Sharples (Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department of Transport) for the International Day of Women and Girls in Science and are currently in the process of organising celebrations for the International Women in Engineering Day (INWED) 2023. As well as these events we have also developed GSE Connect, a scheme to support women in the GSE profession by providing peer support and networking opportunities. Having recently expanded our membership, over the next year we are hoping to organise more focused activities and go beyond our current programmes of work."
