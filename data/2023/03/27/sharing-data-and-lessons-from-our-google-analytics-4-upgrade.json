Google is replacing the current version of GA, Universal Analytics or UA, with a new version, GA4. We\u2019ve already talked about our preparations for upgrading to GA4, and the technical side of our implementation. Now, we want to open up access to our data to others across government and to share more information on the specifics of our approach."

These cover user interactions with elements of GOV.UK such as tabs within pages and accordion components."

This comes with its own potential problems. Changes to the data structure mean that our daily data tables are almost 20% larger in GA4, so we expect storage costs to increase. We hope that query costs may decrease if we take advantage of the more granular row level data to be more specific with our queries."

Providing visibility of what the new data will look like will also help the migration of any reports and tools departments have which rely on GOV.UK GA data. We\u2019d love to learn from other departments\u2019 experiences, and hear how others are managing the issues we\u2019re facing with GA4."
