These were great for meeting the wider team and understanding the team make up, but they aren't a substitute for getting to know who you\u2019ll be working with on a one-to-one basis. \n\nAs GOV.UK One Login is a new service, we want to make sure users understand what it is and how it can help them do the task they need to do. Clear and concise content is key to this, so we had to make sure we worked closely together from the beginning."
