Despite having no experience, and not knowing what to expect, I applied for a job accompanying prisoners to and from courts or police stations."

It was a big adjustment, but with the support of my new colleagues I soon found my feet and got more and more enjoyment from my work every day. And it turned out to be the beginning of a whole new adventure."

Two years later, I started training to be a prison officer. And I\u2019ve never looked back."

Prisons are full of people who have made bad life choices and need support to break the cycle of reoffending. As a prison officer, you\u2019re a key worker and problem solver who plays a vital role in supporting people in prison and protecting the public."

But I was able to draw on the skills of managing difficult behaviours and conflict that I\u2019d learnt years ago when working in the nursery."

For me, I quickly found my area of expertise, working with prisoners who were at risk of self-harm or suicide. It\u2019s really rewarding work and I\u2019ve had many notes of thanks from prisoners over the years. Several promotions later, I\u2019m now Head of Performance Assurance and Care Team Lead at HMP Isle of Wight."

If you are empathetic, reliable and can connect with a wide range of people, it could be the right role for you. And as a female member of staff, I would encourage more women to consider applying to be prison officers."
