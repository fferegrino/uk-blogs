I\u2019ve set up new ways to prevent conflict; advised Prime Ministers; and worked on the frontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan. Far too often, this has felt like a decades-long lesson in managing intractable conflicts. The time I\u2019m spending at the Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) is a welcome opportunity to turn this around.\u00a0"

They share a single aim: to equip our generation to leave a better legacy. The year-long programme is academic and practical; intense and fun. Above all, it is designed to give our nations the strategy muscle they need to thrive in our ever-more complex world. This year, 120 of us are taking part from 47 different countries. For each of us, the programme is a personal and intellectual journey as much as a professional one. And it\u2019s one of our public sector\u2019s hidden gems."

Four months in, we have discussed the strategic issues of our time with tens of experts. We understand better the trends that will shape our future, from demographics, globalisation and technology to food and water security. We have shared experiences and developed our thinking in seminars and strategic assessments. We have explored and examined our own country, its strengths and fissures. We have probed some of the leaders responsible for shaping the world of which we\u2019re now the stewards. We have tested our own abilities and leadership through a range of strategic exercises and case studies. "

In particular, our Ukrainian colleagues\u2019 intense, traumatic experiences have given them decades\u2019 worth of wisdom from which we can all benefit. And the whole course is ably supported by King\u2019s College London, which gives us ready access to good scholarship."

Its mission was to cultivate the \u201ccommon brain\u201d that would help to avoid a repeat of the First World War. Now, it is adapting to a future in which \u2018defence\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019 mean something completely different. This means, they\u2019re as much about securing the economy and protecting people\u2019s health and way of life as they are about defending territory. In which our security at home is entwined with our security abroad. In which our collective future can only be secured by collective endeavour - across nations, borders, sectors and peoples. Governments around the globe must urgently adapt institutions that were invented for an earlier era to a more complex, dynamic future.\u00a0"
