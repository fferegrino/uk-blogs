The brothers believe they have found a niche in the market, claiming the bigger brands have lost touch with the new-age biker, who is looking for style and quality at an affordable price."

After a quick search on the IPO\u2019s \u2018find a registered design\u2019 page, it appears the brothers have not registered their designs. This is something they could consider doing to add further value to their business and prevent copycats replicating their creations."

            "text": "Unregistered designs are automatic and protect the shape and configuration of your product for either 10 years after it was first sold or 15 years after being created. They also protect the physical appearance of your product for three years from when you go public with your design. There isn\u2019t a register for these rights, however. You can prove your design protection by registering your designs or you can ask a solicitor to keep certified copies of your unregistered design as a record."

This decision was shortly followed by Steven and Sara Davies, leaving just Touker Suleyman and Peter Jones to battle it out."
