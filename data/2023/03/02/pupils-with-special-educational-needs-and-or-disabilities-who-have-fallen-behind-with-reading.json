Study upon study show that children who have been diagnosed with developmental conditions learn to decode words by relying on the same processes as other readers."

Knowing each individual\u2019s learning needs then plays an important part in helping staff to choose the most effective pedagogy to secure the knowledge being taught. Assessment should identify the precise knowledge which pupils need in order to progress through the curriculum. Teaching can then target this knowledge precisely."
