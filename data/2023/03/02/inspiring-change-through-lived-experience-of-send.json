After this time, they have the option to stay on as mentors to younger members of the group."

            "text": "As a council staff member and chair, I support the group to raise awareness of their SEND experiences across education, health and care, and more broadly inspiring other young people with SEND to have a voice. In 2020, NHS England provided funding to each local area to support service provision for children and young people with SEND. In response, the group used their own experience of local services to inform a proposal for an online training resource for professionals; a guide for those working across the Lincolnshire SEND system in how to better communicate with those with SEND."

            "text": "Working with the group, we knew we wanted to change current ways of working and felt communication was a key success factor to that change. I helped the team connect with organisations across education, health and care in Lincolnshire and nationally to draft course content and commissioned a media company to oversee production. As part of this experience, members had the opportunity to work with the company to finesse their script writing skills and video recordings."

Attended by practitioners, the Lincolnshire Parent Carer Forum, SEND charities and partners across Lincolnshire, the team presented their work and secured a commitment from those in attendance to promote and use the resource. To date there has been over 600 training completions, helping improve practitioner confidence across health, education and care to communicate with people with SEND."
