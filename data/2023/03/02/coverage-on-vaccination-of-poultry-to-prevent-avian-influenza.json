Although we are exploring potential for use of vaccination as a preventive measure, we are not at the point of changing any policy and the use of avian influenza vaccines in poultry and other captive birds is unlikely be a viable option for the 2023/24 high risk season."

            "text": "Further evidence is needed on vaccine effectiveness. We need a better understanding of how far vaccines can prevent infection, rather than just reducing mortality, given the risk of vaccinated birds without clinical signs, spreading the virus undetected. This would increase the time taken to detect and eradicate the virus and some trading partners may not accept the use of\u00a0vaccination\u00a0when considering trade in poultry or poultry products. In addition, there are a number of practical, animal welfare and commercial disadvantages relating to the use of currently available vaccines which would present significant logistical and cost challenges to industry."

Any future decisions on disease control measures, including the use of emergency or preventive\u00a0vaccination, will be based upon the latest scientific, ornithological, and veterinary advice."

All poultry and captive birds\u00a0must be housed in England\u00a0until further notice. Bird keepers are required to house their birds indoors and implement strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the threat of avian influenza, regardless of whatever type or size. Introducing these steps on farm is the most effective way in reducing the risk of disease spreading."
