With over 30 teams, comprised of personnel from Defence, government agencies, industry partners as well as other nations, the exercise saw more than 700 cyber specialists descend on Tallinn to test their response to both common and complex cyber threats."

            "text": "Run by volunteers, and inclusive to all Service personnel, the focus of the DCM2 is as much on the development of individual\u2019s cyberspace knowledge and skills as it is on talent identification and recognition. As the leads for the cyber and electromagnetic domain, we\u2019re committed to finding and nurturing individuals with these skills, and this is one of the many reasons why DCM2 is such an important event in the calendar."

            "text": "Despite DCM2 being an annual competition, it is ultimately a training exercise, allowing personnel from across the Armed Forces and partner nations to build their skills within the cyber and electromagnetic domain. Putting these teams into the fast-paced and high-tempo environment of the CyEM domain helps develop their capabilities for Defence in the 21st century."

Not only was this year\u2019s event held overseas, taking place in Tallinn, Estonia, but it also had over 700 people taking part. And, with participants from Japan, Singapore, Kenya and Oman, the exercise is the perfect place for sharing ideas and best practices between nations."

            "text": "While the competition creates an environment where personnel from allied nations can share ideas and techniques used in the Cyber and Electromagnetic domain, it also judges participating teams on the effectiveness and speed of their response and how quickly they identify and adapt to new threats in fast-paced and demanding arena."

We can only hazard guesses at what lies in store for next year\u2019s participants however, what we do know for certain, is that DCM3, like those before it, will challenge the skills that UK Defence, and our allies, have in the Cyber and Electromagnetic Domain."
