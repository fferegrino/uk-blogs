The best part of joining the TRA is getting to use the economics I studied at undergraduate level in a practical setting. Price elasticities, tariff and quota diagrams, consumer surplus - it\u2019s all been put to good use!"

We investigate cases of import dumping and export subsidies from foreign countries into the UK market. The products we investigate can range from ironing boards to different types of steel. One of the best things about being on case teams is the chance to work with lawyers, policy advisors and investigators as well as other analysts. The team comes together to produce a final report with the TRA\u2019s recommendation."

Here we decide whether the particular trade practice being investigated is truly in the economic interest for the UK as a whole. I have been working on the Heavy Plate Steel case this summer. When part of the European Union, we had a measure in place against Heavy Plate imports from China. Now we are evaluating, using all the evidence available, whether we should keep this measure in place. This means considering the interests of UK producers, downstream businesses and upstream businesses."

I\u2019ve also had plenty of opportunity to massively improve my Excel skills! I loved listening to the various guest speakers invited to present to the TRA - we had a particularly informative talk from an LSE professor. This internship has proved to be a highly enjoyable experience!"

My work mainly consists of research tasks, whether that be for a new investigation being published or for part of a presentation. This research work is varied, covering topics such as inflation, employment, import sales and key materials for relevant goods. There is always something that can appeal to you when working here. My timetable also has at least one meeting each day, with some weeks including seminars from staff in other departments. I also like to reach out to senior co-workers about any projects I can work on when my workload is light; this allows me to socialise with team members I spend less time with, as well as develop my skills further."

It was valuable to see how the real-world production processes diverge from the simple assumptions of the textbook! We then met with finance managers, and I had the opportunity to ask questions about evidence they had submitted."
