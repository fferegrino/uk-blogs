In July 2022, Defence published the Psychological Safety in MOD Major Projects report which revealed key factors that enabled and inhibited Psychological Safety within 12 of our major projects. Those factors included leading change; setting and communicating the vision; culture and learning from experience; designing and delivering capability; and driving value."

Despite their high scores the team wanted to better understand how Psychological Safety could support the development of a sustainable high-performing team. They have since undertaken a series of collective activities to enhance their team environment."

In May 2023, the Armoured Cavalry Programme (Ajax) Lessons Learned Review led by Clive Sheldon KC concluded that although \u201cinformation was not communicated due to problems with \u2018psychological safety\u2019 ... an absence of psychological safety did impact negatively on a number of individuals working on the programme, and for some it influenced the way in which information was reported\u201d."

Each assessment, independently conducted, extracts data on how psychologically safe a programme team environment is and assesses the extent to which key acquisition behaviours are exhibited. The results are compiled into a thematic report and a tailored action plan is co-created with the leadership of the team to support their progress towards becoming a sustainable high-performing team."

Results revealed that the programme team were, in general, operating within a psychologically safe environment and were role-modelling those key behaviours, but it also identified some areas for improvement. The team are now implementing a tailored action plan to improve and sustain their Psychological Safety as a team. A follow-up will be undertaken in March 2024 to measure progress."

This will give us a better understanding of the overarching factors impacting Psychological Safety in Defence and drive improvement in our project team environments and ultimately the achievement of Defence\u2019s objectives."
