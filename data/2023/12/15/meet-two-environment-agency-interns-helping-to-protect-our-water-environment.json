Our\u00a0Summer Diversity Internship Programme (SDIP) offers students from diverse backgrounds the chance to kickstart their careers and give them an insight into the breadth of work undertaken by the EA."

In July, they both began their internships as part of the EA\u2019s SDIP. Siobhan says she thought that the Environment Agency seemed like a perfect place to begin her career. and the support she received through from the start was helpful: \u201cI think that the Environment Agency was the one that got back to me the most during the application process,\u201d she says."

            "text": "Their internships have given them a valuable insight into the EA\u2019s work, including a two-day site visit on water resources in Cumbria where they learned first hand about protecting water resources. Siobhan says that a lot of the work was based around water resilience planning, in \u201cmaking sure that water companies can provide sufficient water to their customers for the next twenty, thirty, fifty years - but also that it's not at the cost of the environment.\u201d Rion agrees, \u201cI think water is going to become a bit more of a scarce resource in the next twenty to thirty years. The EA is trying to plan for that. Our work will hopefully be a positive contribution to that,\u201d he says."

            "text": "They spent time with the with Hydrology and Telemetry team, including operating a boat with a sensor attached to measure the flow of the river Thames. They worked with the ecology team, where they waded through a river to take water samples for invertebrate identification. They also attended EA and industry workshops on water and energy and learned about the EA\u2019s work on drought incidents."

        {
            "text": "The variety of different activities gave them both a taste of EA work areas that they hadn\u2019t considered before. As Rion states: \u201cWater resources planning was not something I ever had my eye on, but I\u2019ve gained extremely useful knowledge and experience.\u201d The internship also enabled him to build on the skills he learned in his degree. As someone with a fascination with maps, he says that getting to apply his knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology for mapping rivers was a personal highlight."

They took part in an informative tour about the Lower Otter Restoration Project (LORP), a partnership initiative between Clinton Devon Estates and the Environment Agency which aims to enhance the downstream section of the river."

            "text": "Rion and Siobhan have both now managed to secure permanent positions at the EA, and they both plan on pursuing careers here. Reflecting on her work on water security, Siobhan says \u201cI think people just always expect water to be there when you turn on the tap. I realized through the internship there's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes.\u201d She feels proud of the work she\u2019s done so far. \u201cEven if we're contributing like tiny amount, it still feels we\u2019re contributing to something, making sure people have enough water in the future\u201d she says."
