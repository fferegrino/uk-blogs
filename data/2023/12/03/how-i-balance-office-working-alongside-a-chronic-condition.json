It\u2019s therefore been important for me to try and find ways to strike a sensible and attainable balance between my home and office working."

My scooter has a hoist, and this allows me to get it in and out of the car without any issues. I have a car parking space, which is reserved for me to use, and with the lift taking me from the underground car park up to the office, it\u2019s simple."

The nature of my illness may mean I can walk a short distance, but that is not something I can sustain. Therefore, not only does the scooter conserve my energy, but it also means I can minimise the pain I suffer daily."

            "text": "This flexibility also applies, for example, if there is an influx of colds and flu around the office. Due to the medication which I take for my conditions, I am classed as severely immune supressed. This not only makes me more vulnerable to illnesses, but it also has the effect of making it more difficult to fight illness off. The last thing I want to do is expose myself to illness. This does of course reinforce the message that if you aren\u2019t well enough to attend the office, please don\u2019t, as you never know who you are exposing to your illness."

Stress also makes a difference to how my body reacts, and stress alone can cause a flare up, one of the many wonders in how my body can react to RA on a daily basis. Minimising stress, therefore, has also been a real work enabler for me."
