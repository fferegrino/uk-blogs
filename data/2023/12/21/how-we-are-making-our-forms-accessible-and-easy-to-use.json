Overwhelmingly there were several features, such as repeater questions or tabular data capture, custom validation for data fields and conditional or branching questions that any forms solution would need to deliver to meet the requirements for digitising our existing forms, and to make real headway in removing Defra\u2019s reliance on paper (document based) forms."
