            "text": "Regulation 17A of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 was amended with effect from 15 December 2023. This amendment prohibits UK banks[1] from processing payments previously processed by designated banks (meaning banks designated specifically under regulation 17A) or which are intended for a designated bank. So, if a UK bank receives funds that have been routed from or via a designated bank, directly or indirectly, the UK bank should not process the transaction even if the account holders sending and receiving the funds are not designated for the purposes of the asset freeze or otherwise sanctioned. Designation status for the purposes of regulation 17A can be found within OFSI\u2019s consolidated list. Please note that credit and financial institutions that are owned or controlled by a bank which is designated for the purposes of regulation 17A will also be captured by this prohibition."

            "text": "Put simply, correspondent banking is how banks make payments internationally \u2013 they often use one, or a series of, intermediary banks (or \u201ccorrespondent\u201d banks) to make the payment. For example, if Bank A in the UK wants to send money to Bank X in Brazil, it may try to find a bank that has a presence in both countries. Bank A has a relationship with Bank B who has a presence in both the UK and Brazil. Bank A will transfer the funds to Bank B in the UK who will transfer the funds from its UK entity to its Brazil entity. The funds will then be transferred from the Brazil entity of Bank B to their final destination at Bank X. To enable this, the banks have accounts with each other (these are known as \u201cnostro\u201d and \u201cvostro\u201d accounts). Sometimes, a series of correspondent banks will be used to complete a payment from sender to receiver. When reading about these transactions you may see the terms \u2018remitting bank\u2019 and \u2018beneficiary bank\u2019. Simply put, the remitting bank is the bank sending the funds originally and the beneficiary bank is the receiving bank, or intended destination bank in the payment chain"

In other words, if a UK bank receives funds previously routed from or via a designated bank, or has instructions to pay funds to a designated bank, they must not transmit those funds onwards. The banks must act this way both 1) in a situation where the remitting bank is designated and 2) in a situation where a non-designated bank has initiated the payment but it has been processed via a designated bank before reaching the UK bank."
