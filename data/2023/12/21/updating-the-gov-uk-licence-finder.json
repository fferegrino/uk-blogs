That\u2019s why our product teams working on GOV.UK regularly evaluate the tools we offer to make sure they\u2019re still fit for purpose and providing the right information quickly, every time it\u2019s required."

Individuals starting a business need to know which licences they need, so they can operate safely and legally. For example, someone opening a restaurant may need a licence to serve alcohol, a licence to advertise their business, or a licence to play music in the background."

User satisfaction is up markedly and, by engaging with the Department for Business and Trade and simplifying the content management, we\u2019ve increased the number of findable licences by more than half. This post explains how we delivered this successful outcome for users and what happens next."

Departments will be adding and updating their licence content over the next few months, and we will be monitoring analytics in order to identify usability issues and rolling out iterations where necessary."
