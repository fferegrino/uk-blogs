In parallel to this extension review, we will soon be reviewing Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQ), an important part of the steel safeguard measure."

A simple way of thinking of these quotas is as a \u2018pot\u2019 from which steel can be imported without incurring the safeguard tariff. The quota covers a three-month period, so once the \u2018pot\u2019 has been used up, all future imports for that quarter will have a tariff of 25%."

Countries who had imported more than 5% of the total amount of imports into the UK for a particular category of steel received their own quota."

Following this review, due to fluctuations in import levels, changes were made to the TRQs after some developing countries were found to be no longer eligible for the DCE, and others previously excluded were given access to it. \u00a0The recommendations in this review were made by analysing data from HMRC on imports that were coming into the UK across all categories of steel subject to the safeguard measure. \u00a0In this type of review, this is the only evidence that is taken into consideration."

The changes are not quickly or easily implemented, therefore the timeframe to conduct a DCE TRQ review is very narrow."
