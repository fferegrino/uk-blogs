Given my prior experience in the UK from 2014 to 2017 and the intriguing nature of the job description, the decision was straightforward. My responsibilities encompass a spectrum of tasks, ranging from comprehensive literature reviews and data collection to the ongoing consolidation of analysis. As the publication date for the seventh edition of Global Strategic Trends approaches, our focus has shifted towards effectively communicating GST through multimedia and augmented reality."
