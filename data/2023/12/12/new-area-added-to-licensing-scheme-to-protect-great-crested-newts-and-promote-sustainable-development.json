            "text": "The DLL scheme tackles this issue at the landscape scale by using innovative modelling to predict where great crested newts are now, and where the best places are to create and restore ponds to support them in the future. When a development commits to joining DLL, the impact of the development is converted into a financial contribution that the developer then commits to pay. 85% of the funding is used by Natural England and our delivery partners to create and restore ponds. This also covers monitoring, management, and maintenance of the ponds across 25 years."
