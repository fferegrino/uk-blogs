I helped scope for new consumer law enforcement cases and this taught me a lot about strategy, prioritisation and working within a team to make decisions. I also helped launch and run enforcement cases over my secondment. Overall, this experience was incredibly valuable as I was able to develop my understanding of consumer laws and CMA enforcement powers.\u00a0 The project I was on very much sat at the forefront of law and technology. Further, the CMA clearly value knowledge sharing as there is no shortage of talks and seminars to attend.\u201d"
