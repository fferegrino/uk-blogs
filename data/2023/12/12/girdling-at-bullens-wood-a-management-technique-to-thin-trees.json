He is the owner of the tree nursery Aveland Trees and has written several blogs on planting and management which can be read on their website. In this blog, he discusses his experience with girdling at Bullens Wood."

Bullens Wood was planted in a field corner that had been uncropped for three years and the biggest obstacle to its establishment was rank weed growth, mainly grasses."

            "text": "The trees were protected with 60cm spiral guards and supported by 90cm canes which allowed spot spraying with Glyphosate around all trees for the first two years. Ash was used for beating up (replacement of newly planted trees) after the first year only, and it took two or three years of maintenance to get the wood established."

            "text": "I realised that I would have to do some thinning straightaway to save the remaining oak and allow the best ash and Norway maple to develop broad healthy crowns. The grey alder produces much fewer cones than common alders and so were of less value to seed eating birds."

            "text": "I had to start thinning to allow the oaks to develop. This, combined with the fact that grey alder is a poor timber tree, meant that it was the obvious choice to start building up the dead wood habitat and soil carbon storage in Bullens Wood."

            "text": "I didn\u2019t want the expense of employing felling contractors, and I wanted close control over the thinning operation, so I began trials of thinning trees myself by girdling (also referred to as ring-barking) \u2013 a technique that involves using a sharp tool to cut through a tree\u2019s bark to kill the tree without having to cut it down. An advantage of girdling is that the trees do not need to be removed from site and can create an important habitat in the form of standing deadwood which will decompose over time benefitting woodland soils and biodiversity."

            "text": "Once the trees needing to be thinned were selected and marked, they could be quickly girdled \u2013 with all the protective equipment in place \u2013 you can hold a chainsaw against the tree at waist height and cut through the bark as you walk around the tree. Simple girdling is not enough to kill the tree \u2013 the cambium (the layer of the tree\u2019s trunk beneath the bark) will regrow, so I applied a solution of Glyphosate with a hand applicator to the cut, which was 100% effective in killing the tree"

            "text": "When trees are girdled in the autumn or winter, they will usually come into leaf the following spring. Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis are unable to be transported through the tree, so the roots starve and die. The roots are then unable to pump sap up into the canopy and the tree dies."
        },
        {
            "text": "As the tree slowly dies it first sheds its leaves, then the smaller twigs and branches. Three years after girdling, most trees have a stem that is sound and dry (about 20% moisture, a bit more at the base and much less in the smaller branches of the crown, which will all dry quickly below 20% when prepared for burning). This is ideal for firewood, as it needs no further storage and can be taken straight from the wood to the stove."

        {
            "text": "A typical girdled tree will remain standing for many years because the branches become brittle and drop off, while the roots stay sound. Eventually, just the stump remains. There is little danger of a girdled tree toppling because the roots anchor the tree for many years even after it has died. On the other hand, a tree that has suffered root infections for many years may fall with a full crown at any time, possibly doing considerable damage to property and could endanger people."

            "text": "Conventional felling produces sudden gaps in the canopy that increase the exposure of neighbouring trees to the sun and wind. Thinning by girdling results in no sudden changes to the environment, and therefore no sudden changes to tree growth. Oaks often produce epicormic shoots (a shoot growing from a bud underneath the bark of a trunk, stem, or branch) after a thinning \u2013 this reduces the value of their timber. By contrast, girdling slowly opens gaps in the canopy over several years as the girdled tree dies, allowing plenty of time for the crowns of neighbouring trees to grow into the new space."

            "text": "Girdling results in a natural process like a tree dying slowly of disease. A complete woodland ecosystem requires standing and lying dead trees at all stages of decomposition. This can be achieved by girdling but not harvesting the trees."

        {
            "text": "When a tree dies, its natural defences are removed. It becomes a particularly rich environment for insects and fungi as well as woodpeckers and other wildlife. When the dead branches fall they become lying deadwood. The dead wood becomes moist, and decay is hastened by insects and fungi making it their new home. Organic matter makes its way into the soil and the woodland begins to build up its carbon storage."

            "text": "When girdling, you should avoid creating lots of recently dead standing trees within a contained space. For example, if a species being girdled is prone to a wood boring pest such as Ips typographus in spruce, this deadwood could be a perfect habitat for the pest."

The time will come when I must thin some of the oak trees where they are growing too close to each other. That will be a difficult decision to take."
