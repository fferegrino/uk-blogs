Where data is shared or has the potential to be shared between two organisations it is important that both organisations they\u00a0 have a shared understanding of the roles and accountabilities associated with the data asset. The new data ownership model for government defines roles around those essential shared data assets and drives broad accountabilities around a number of key data principles such as data being secure and managed effectively throughout its lifecycle.\u00a0"
