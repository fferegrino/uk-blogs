            "text": "Despite being the fundamental first stage, seeds can be an overlooked step of the tree production process. Often, it is assumed that seed will be readily available for any species or provenance that may be needed to plant thriving and resilient trees and woodlands. However, the situation is much more complex."

        {
            "text": "On occasion, British seed supply for some species does not meet requirements. Sometimes this leads to imports of seed from other countries to meet nurseries needs. However, imported seed is not always sufficient to meet demand, may not be genetically appropriate, and comes with the risk of importing harmful pests and pathogens. As tree planting continues to accelerate, demand for seed and therefore reliance on imports will also increase."

Through Defra\u2019s Nature for Climate Fund (NCF) we are investing in both the private and public sectors to ensure we have a resilient, diverse, and bio-secure supply of tree seed for our ambitious tree planting targets of 16.5% tree and woodland cover by 2050. So, how are we doing this?"

Private nurseries, seed suppliers, estate managers, and landowners have a major role to play in ensuring we have a diverse and secure supply of tree seed.
