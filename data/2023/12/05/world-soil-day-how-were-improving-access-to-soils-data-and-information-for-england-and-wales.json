As Defra and Cranfield University jointly own the Intellectual Property Rights in LandIS, the agreement we have been working on reflects how we will continue work in partnership to maintain this important resource."

As soil health is central to delivering our objectives on biodiversity and profitable agriculture, LandIS continues to be a key resource for the Department."
