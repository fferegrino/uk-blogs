I chaired a panel that included Lucy Caffery from National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Ian Cameron from Met Office, and Tony Soteriou from UK Research and Innovation to talk about how a Knowledge Asset Management Strategy (KAMS) can help organisations manage their KAs better."

As part of their work, they developed and implemented policies, procedures, and a coherent strategy, specifically considering the behaviours that existed and that they wanted to shape."

Therefore, a KAMs for the centre required close collaboration with each of these partners and taking their individual approaches into consideration. Tony described how it also had to speak to a diverse audience of 8,000 colleagues, half of whom work in research and the other half in managing grants, corporate, and administration."
