The health and safety lab is set on a 550-acre site and is home to an impressive directory of laboratory and large-scale testing facilities, set within the rolling hills of Derbyshire."

It was great to see government science and engineering on the ground level, and the diversity of expertise on show at just one location, within one department."

The team also covered opportunities for those that were interested in becoming more involved in the profession through becoming L&D champions within their department or joining the Diversity and Inclusion Action Group (DIAG)."

            "text": "After the event, Vicky Warbrick, one of the event organisers and GSE member, said: \u201cThe science street event created a great buzz and generated lots of conversations around the various stalls. It was an opportunity to share the science, engineering and analysis knowledge we generate across our organisation in an informal way. These events are the perfect way to bring our GSE professionals together, helping them make new connections, broaden their understanding of what research is happening across HSE and giving them an opportunity to hone their science communication skills.\u201d "

Holding events like science street is a great way to bring your colleagues together to communicate the work that they do, find opportunities to collaborate with others and invite external guests to build connections for the future."
