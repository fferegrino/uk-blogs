The Commission is keen to demystify trusteeship, enabling more people to get involved and give back to society \u2013 and the roundtable was a great opportunity to hear from those who are currently doing the role and to learn from their experiences to help inform what more we can do as the regulator to grow the number of those volunteering at every age."

            "text": "And it brings benefits for individuals too. The trustees I met at the roundtable described how being a trustee had improved their personal well-being, helped them develop a range of skills and is helping their career development. While they all had a slightly different take on trusteeship, the one thing they all had in common was that it had brought something positive to their lives. These attitudes, I\u2019m pleased to say, are shared across our entire trustee community."

            "text": "We know younger generations are keen to enact change - and what better and more effective way to do so than from the inside. The core purpose of charities is to improve people\u2019s lives. Be it through environmental action, tangible health and social care services or improving the accessibility of sport, the arts and culture. Being on a charity board means you\u2019re guiding the ship, you are helping to make decisions about what the charity does and overseeing the way it is done. There are very few opportunities in the world like this, that are open to so many."

            "text": "While we\u2019re keen for more younger people to explore trusteeship, people of all ages have something to contribute to a charity\u2019s governance. We know a board that\u2019s more varied in background, skills and experience is more diverse in its thinking. A leadership team \u2013 whether executive or non-executive - that can scrutinise and evaluate a problem or opportunity from a variety of perspectives is likely to be more effective than one that\u2019s governed by people who all come from the same walk of life."

One of the common misconceptions, and something I again heard last week, was that trusteeship \u2018isn\u2019t for people like me\u2019. As one trustee said, \u2018you can\u2019t be, what you can\u2019t see\u2019."

But the discussion left me feeling optimistic and hopeful for the future. The sector is already in the safe hands of current trustees and I hope many more will make the decision to join them soon."
