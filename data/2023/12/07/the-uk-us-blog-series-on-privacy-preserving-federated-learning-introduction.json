Machine learning techniques shape what information we see online, influence critical business decisions, and aid scientific discovery, which is driving advances in healthcare, climate modelling, and more."

        {
            "text": "The standard way to train machine learning models is to collect the training data centrally, on one server or in one data centre, where it can be used to train the model. A model is what we get from the output of training on the data; once trained, a model is then used for predictions or generating new content. For example, a consortium of banks may want to train a model to detect fraudulent transactions; to do so, they\u2019ll need to collect transaction data from many different banks on a central server, as shown in Figure 1(a)."

        {
            "text": "Collecting sensitive financial data raises serious privacy concerns, however. If the central server is compromised or its owner is not trustworthy, then the data may be leaked or used for other purposes. Sharing sensitive information like financial data may not even be possible due to privacy regulations or other legal restrictions. Apart from security and privacy concerns, in some cases the data may raise intellectual property issues."
        },
        {
            "text": "Because of these challenges, many organisations simply decide to not share data. As a result, useful models\u2014like the fraud detector in our example\u2014are impossible to build."
        },
        {
            "text": "This blog series focuses on federated learning, an approach that addresses the fundamental privacy challenge of traditional machine learning by avoiding the centralised collection of training data. In federated learning, the central server sends a copy of the partially trained model to each participating organisation and collects model updates instead of data, as shown in Figure 1(b). Each organisation constructs its model update by training the model locally on its own sensitive data\u2014which never leaves the organisation. The resulting model updates can be aggregated and assembled to construct an improved model. This process repeats until the model is trained. Examples of successful use of federated learning include Google\u2019s Gboard, Speech, and Messages, and Apple\u2019s news personalisation and speech recognition. However, there are currently limited examples of federated learning being used to enable collaboration between different organisations without direct sharing of data \u2013 such a setup has the potential to unlock new use cases that could provide significant societal and economic benefits."

Contestants could tackle two high-impact use cases: combating financial crime, and responding to public health emergencies. In both cases, contestants were tasked with training a machine learning classifier on a federated dataset, whilst providing end-to-end privacy guarantees."

The results also highlighted areas where existing techniques are not yet practical, and more research is needed."
