            "text": "It\u2019s a full-on start as you spend the first four weeks with the other new apprentices, but we\u2019re a really good group and we get on well. There\u2019s such a range of past experiences among us, which is valuable. We have a former postal worker, NHS worker, and art student, for instance. Everyone is interested and passionate but we\u2019re all novices in forestry. There isn\u2019t an expectation of previous experience. For the last few years I was working in the arboriculture and garden landscaping industry so I\u2019ve been around trees a lot in my previous work, but it hasn\u2019t been a massive benefit over the other people who have spent time in other workplaces like maternity wards. The apprenticeship is set up to give anyone of any background the chance to become foresters, we all find ourselves on the same level."

Then weeks three and four were at Cannock Chase again team building, learning about risk assessments, and biosecurity training which is about the things we can do to help prevent the spread of tree pests and diseases as we go about our work."

            "text": "Since then, I\u2019ve been proactive in getting out on a lot of site visits so I can get the most exposure to what a Woodland Officer does. I\u2019ve been out with a few local councils. I\u2019ve also met quite a lot of farmers, and I was part of a water catchment meeting that included local MPs, Natural England, and others. It\u2019s encouraging to see all the collaboration between organisations."

            "text": "The best thing about the programme so far is how I\u2019m already contributing to changes in the landscape. I\u2019ve been helping Woodland Officers to ensure that new planting is being undertaken responsibly and that existing woodlands are managed carefully. You really get to know more about your local area and visit places you\u2019ve never been to. I\u2019m going to Blenheim Estate soon to see their woodland management plan and that\u2019s an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t have without being in this role."

If you can\u2019t identify trees, for instance, that\u2019s not an issue, that\u2019s what the course is here to help with. You just need to be interested and passionate. You\u2019ll get to show that passion at the assessment days. I\u2019ve never had an interview quite like it. As well as the formal interview panel that most of us are used to, there were design tasks, analytical tasks and an assessed walk, something for everyone to show off their skills and strengths."

The gap between submitting my application and starting in the role has been around six months, and it will be another three years until I graduate, so you need to commit."

            "text": "It has definitely been the right move for me. It has given me instant exposure to the forestry industry. We\u2019ve had opportunities to go to active harvesting sites to see what machines are used and what the felling process is. We also went to the Forestry Conference in October. That was the best day for me so far. It had a focus on the next generation, so we saw the advancements in technology, aerial drone surveys, electric engines, a whole pioneering attitude. It was an amazing glimpse into the future of forestry. In three years when we graduate the sector\u2019s going to look very different and we\u2019re going to be part of that \u2013 that\u2019s a fantastic feeling."
