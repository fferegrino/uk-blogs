            "text": "So, what exactly are SuDS? In short, they are a collection of water management systems that aim to align modern drainage systems with natural water processes. The key objectives are to manage the flow rate and volume of surface runoff, and consequently reduce the pressure on the sewerage network and reduce flood risk."

            "text": "Leading this project and working within the Department for Education\u2019s risk protection arrangement (RPA), I know the issues schools can face when there has been increased rainfall in a short period of time. Because many of your schools have a large amount of hard surface area, for example your playgrounds and pathways, surface water pooling can leave playing fields looking more like a big muddy puddle and somewhere that children can\u2019t play on."

We want to support you to increase climate and flood resilience and schools are a natural place for SuDS, as they have large areas of land and roofs that can be used to collect and manage rainwater."

            "text": "But it\u2019s not just about the benefits for the school estate, SuDS can also be used to create educational opportunities, teaching pupils about water management and the environment. Another important feature about the work of this team is the impact these systems have on not only water quantity and quality, but how this can help counter the effects of pollution and biodiversity."

Its enhanced educational benefits, with a new green space is used not just for play, but for different classes, including maths, science, art and craft, reconnecting the children with nature and wildlife."

            "text": "By 2026, working with partners such as the Environment Agency, water companies and LLFAs, we aim to reduce the flood risk in over 800 schools through our water strategy initiatives, and SuDs is a large part of this. Through more projects like the one at Ursuline Catholic Primary School we hope that more children will grow up knowing about natural ways to manage water and have an increased understanding of the impact of climate change."
