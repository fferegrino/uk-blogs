These mariners, who rely on electronic and paper charts for navigation, represent a diverse range of vessel types, users and navigation requirements, in the UK and around the globe."

To maximise the safety of navigation in national and international waters, we along with other organisations in the hydrographic community, believe that official hydrographic data should be widely available on digital displays."

Here we discussed the international challenge of the absence of a suitable compliant Electronic Chart System (ECS) solution to be used by mariners in place of or alongside paper chart navigation."

            "text": "Digital solutions offer significant positional, safety and operational advantages to mariners, including the potential for near real-time updates, which greatly improve the accuracy of navigation and ease of use. These benefits will be further enhanced through the next generation of navigation solutions, underpinned by the new S-100 data standards."

We understand that there is a diverse and varied community of users who rely on our electronic and paper charts, from those in voyage planning and shore-based operations, to those who sail a variety of vessels on many routes. The final stage in the delivery of such a solution would fall to equipment manufacturers, before this can happen, it is necessary to set out the technical and regulatory standards that would underpin such a solution."

This shows how important it is for the hydrographic community to develop the right solution, ensuring safe, efficient, and trusted navigation for all mariners around the world."

As a next step, the ECS Project Team will develop a set of recommendations that can then be taken out to the wider IHO membership and external organisations."
