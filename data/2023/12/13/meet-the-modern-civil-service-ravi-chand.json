The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are innovating change, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs across the UK."

Ravi believes it is one that draws skills from all sections of society, has a presence in every corner of the United Kingdom and is recognised by the public locally for its work. Whether it be a particular department or as a Civil Service as a whole, A Modern Civil Service is one that delivers great services and understands local needs."

Places for Growth wants to identify and relocate the right type of quality roles and attract a high calibre of individuals, both externally and throughout the existing Civil Service. Ravi also believes this will be particularly effective in policy roles and operational delivery roles \u2014 location shouldn\u2019t be a barrier at any grade."

This led to other departments, who have economic policy skills and professionals, relocating there.

If it can be done with the Treasury, it can be done by any department!"

Many people join the graduate scheme from the local universities in Manchester, while Belfast and Cardiff have a strong cyber security focus\u00a0 and are fast becoming popular hubs.
