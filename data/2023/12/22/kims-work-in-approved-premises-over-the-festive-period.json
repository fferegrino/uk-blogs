With over 20 years of experience in probation, Kim's journey from being a case administrator to her current role has been marked by a keen interest in the operational side and a commitment to supporting offenders' rehabilitation and prospects. She reflects on the complex yet fulfilling nature of her role, especially during the festive season.\u00a0"

            "text": "I think the fact that it can be a very lonely time for the offenders is one of the biggest challenges when working over Christmas and New Year's. Some prefer to spend time on their own and it's that balance of trying to not push it in their faces and make them feel that they have to be happy, and have to get involved in everything. They know that staff are there 24/7. If they wanted to have a one-to-one conversation. And, if they want to sit in their room, they know that we'd be checking on them regularly just to make sure they're OK. I think it's that fine balance of trying to understand that it\u2019s a difficult time. As well as trying to make it a positive environment where we've got things on to distract them which can help them from returning to substance misuse, negative thinking or losing their motivation to succeed and make positive changes.\u00a0 \u00a0"

            "text": "Also, the allocation of home leave is a big factor. You might get some offenders who are like, \u201cWell, they\u2019ve got home leave- why haven\u2019t I got home leave?\u201d. Some may want to spend time with their family, but because of restrictions, and assessments, it\u2019s not been approved. So, sometimes you have people who are obviously quite upset that they\u2019ve not had home leave approved or it\u2019s too soon for them to be tested in that environment, which you need to manage.\u00a0"

I tend to work over this period to add some consistency, and a familiar face because I work there quite often and they get to know staff. I think they're quite grateful that they know the people generally who are working Christmas Day want to be there over that time to support them. It\u2019s really positive being able to support them and see them progress.\u00a0 Seeing how they handle the day as well is really rewarding. It's a very tough day for quite a lot of them. So, seeing them get through it and manage it well is always good.\u00a0"

I started as a case administrator and was then a probation services officer for about 8-9 years in Offender Management. I've always done additional work usually on a weekend, first in Community Payback and then I moved over to approved premises. I've always had a love for the operational side, and I could never choose between the two, so I do both. It helps me significantly in my business manager role as I have a ground-level knowledge of current issues.\u00a0"

We don't always get success stories all of the time, but when you do it really makes it so worthwhile. You see them go through a journey, starting with what you read about them on paper and how they present themselves, to learning to trust and take on the support and help. Seeing them progress, address their offending behaviour and reduce their risk, getting involved in some of the activities, learning new skills and successfully moving on and making those steps to change is really worthwhile, and I think that's why I\u2019ve stayed working in probation for so long.\u00a0\u00a0"
