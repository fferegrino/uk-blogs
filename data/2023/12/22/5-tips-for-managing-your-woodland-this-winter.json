It\u2019s acknowledged as the best time to plant trees as it allows time for the roots to establish as they will keep growing through the milder winter days. Even though the top of the tree is dormant in winter, root growth is crucial for the trees\u2019 survival if we suffer a spring drought.\u00a0\u00a0"

Taking the time to count your trees and replant any which have died can be done through the winter months ready for the next growing season. Newly planted trees are particularly vulnerable for the first 3 years or so as their roots are not yet well enough established to find water during droughts or prolonged dry spells. You can also take this opportunity to check if there is any one species not thriving on the site and look to replace them with a different better-adapted tree.\u00a0"

During the cold season, in deciduous woodland after leaf-fall, the brackets and toadstools of various fungi are easier to spot on the stems, crown and around the bases and roots of trees. Many are harmless or even beneficial, but many others can kill trees and even whole stands if not dealt with. Getting to know the ones that are harmful with a bit of reading up on tree pests and diseases, can be a good way to spend a wet day indoors.\u00a0\u00a0"

If you are a firewood producer and you have an area for seasoning and processing, firewood orders are likely to be coming in fast so, if you haven\u2019t already sold out, firewood can be loaded up ready for sale and any wood for seasoning stacked in the dry. Do be aware of the new regulations to ensure firewood is sufficiently well-seasoned to reduce air pollution with the Ready to Burn scheme.\u00a0"

Of particular importance in woodland are bats and common dormice (although all wildlife is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) so great care should be taken not to disturb them if they are present.\u00a0"

Practise good biosecurity at all times and make sure your boots and equipment are cleaned before you start any work and before you leave the site. If you have visitors to your woodland, make sure they do the same. It\u2019s a great idea to always have a simple biosecurity kit on hand.\u00a0"

Woodlands are fantastic for our physical and mental health, and watching your woodland thrive in the coldest season can be incredibly rewarding.\u00a0"
