The Lord Chancellor\u2019s recent prison reform proposals, which will help alleviate ongoing prison capacity issues, were closely informed by data analysis."

Justice in numbers is available as a hard-copy pocketbook, but online you can drill down into the data underpinning the charts to get a better understanding of trends and latest data. If you\u2019re looking for the latest published numbers for a briefing or writing a speech, this is now the go-to source. Justice in numbers has won praise from practitioners and researchers for helping people to get an at-a-glance sense of how the system works and helping the curious to dig down into the data to improve their understanding."

The dashboards are interactive and have been further developed this year to reflect requests from local agencies. I have attended Local Criminal Justice Boards and talked to Police and Crime Commissioners to see how they are being used in practice to get a shared understanding of priorities across local agencies, and to see what more we can do to help."

For example, on which kinds of intervention and support are more likely to help an individual turn away from crime. Data First researchers have shared a cross-justice system dataset\u00a0that links users from across the courts, prisons, and probation with those of the civil and family courts in England and Wales. This will help us better understand the extent to which people dealing with debt or housing issues are also involved in the criminal justice system, and how many people involved in care proceedings in family court are subject to criminal cases at the same time."

This revealed that only around 40% of those with these requirements appeared in treatment data, suggesting that large numbers of offenders are not completing their treatment and allowing probation officers to follow up with those most likely to drop out. BOLD have also produced a tool for probation staff which cuts down the duplication of data entry and significantly reduces the need for probation officers to search for data, freeing up their time to allow more offender management to reduce reoffending."
