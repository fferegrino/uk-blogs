There was a lot of delay and uncertainty for Harry in the beginning, which has had a huge long-term impact on him.\u00a0 He has a disability which means he needs a lot of support and attends a special school part-time. Harry is not related to us; we were his mum\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents. He was placed with my husband and I at the age of two by children\u2019s services, at 40 minutes notice, as his mum was having a mental health breakdown and needed medical attention. He arrived in a car seat, with very little else. We know now that this is the usual way that most kinship families are made \u2013 a loving response to a crisis situation."

From the beginning we worked together with them to ensure that Harry sees his mum, who now has ongoing treatment from mental health services, his sister, and the wider family, regularly. It just so happened that we were there for him at a time when he needed a family with the time and patience to meet his many needs. His Mum and Grandma often tell him that he\u2019s lucky to have two mums and a dad. He knows he is so very loved. And isn\u2019t that the most important thing in life?"
