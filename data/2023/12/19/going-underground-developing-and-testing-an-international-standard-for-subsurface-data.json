The Geospatial Commission has been closely involved in the development of this standard through its National Underground Asset Register (NUAR) programme. The NUAR data model is the first implementation of the MUDDI model (effectively representing the UK excavation profile, of it) and it is exciting to see the standard moving towards publication and adoption, initially as a high-level conceptual model."

We also provided various artefacts related to the NUAR data model, including an encoding in Geography Markup Language (GML) format, as well as in a database format which is used in the implementation of the NUAR platform."

This is one of the key elements of the NUAR programme."
