And we welcome the opportunity to work with the CQC on improving the regulation of services. We will respond in June 2024."

As is so often the case in children\u2019s social care, data is the start of a conversation rather than a set of answers. So, the dashboard will not prompt an inspection, but it may help you to talk to inspectors about what is happening locally."

The strategy aims to improve the help available for extended families who step in to care, and provide stability, for children. These families must have timely access to sensitive, proportionate, and wide-ranging support that meets their child\u2019s needs. Many of these children will have had difficult experiences in their lives that are like those typically experienced by those who have entered the care system. That is why the emphasis on clarifying the kinship carer role to determine the right level of assessment and support is both important and welcome."
