For example, the collection-based science that underpins so much of the work at the Natural History Museum, the innovations at STFC created to help answer big questions about the Universe and the new technologies that Ploughshare Innovations, a Ministry of Defence-owned company, sees on a day-to-day basis arising from their client base."

Some may be concerned with how to triage newly identified KAs that arise within their organisation, whilst others might just be starting their KA journeys and not know where to begin. GOTT\u2019s Rose Book is a good place to start."

GOTT runs a Knowledge Asset Network which facilitates the sharing of expertise and experience in KA management. This community is open to all in the public sector who are involved with or have an interest in KA management and exploitation. If you are interested in joining the network, get in touch with the team."

Further, not all projects with KAs we embark on will work out, and that is okay. We are all constantly learning from each other when it comes to generating further benefit from KAs, and that is what makes it such a fascinating and exciting area to be involved in.\u00a0 Keeping an open mind and exploring routes for using KAs in new ways which deliver genuinely scalable and impactful solutions, even if not always the most practical way forward was also very much on the panel\u2019s mind."
