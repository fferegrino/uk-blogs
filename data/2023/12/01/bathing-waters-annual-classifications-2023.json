            "text": "Weekly samples are taken at most sites and then tested at the laboratory for the level of bacteria. The results are then published on our Swimfo website, helping to inform people about when and where they can bathe. The annual bathing water classifications give a long-term assessment of water quality over a \u2018rolling\u2019 four-year period. The classifications for 2023 are based on data from 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023."

        {
            "text": "There are a range of factors which influence bathing water quality and its annual variations with every catchment being different. An unseasonably wet summer as we had this year will have affected this year\u2019s results due to the effects of land run-off, sewage spills from storm overflows and diffuse pollution from agriculture and highway drainage. This temporarily affects water quality but if it is happening frequently across the bathing water season, it will affect the classification. Other factors that influence the results include tides, wind and physical or environmental changes at a site."

        {
            "text": "We issue Pollution Risk Forecasts to give bathers timely information on any daily variations to water quality. These predict average water quality for the day based on an analysis of the effects of the weather and tides where this is possible. We are working on an upgrade to the system to improve and simplify information for bathers."

            "text": "All sectors and organisations that have a role to play in improving the water environment must take collective responsibility and demonstrate that we can work together to deliver the Government\u2019s Plan for Water. The Plan for Water sets out more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement to tackle widespread sources of pollution and clean up our water quality."

            "text": "We work together with local partners to improve water quality at Poor and Sufficient bathing waters, investigating pollution sources and putting local action plans in place to tackle them. If a bathing water is classified as Poor, a sign will be displayed the following year advising against bathing. The classifications for 2023 show that 4 per cent of bathing waters are classified as Poor. We will be progressing action plans over the coming months and following up with further investigations at many of these sites."
