Sadly, the current trend is one of declining health of our rivers. This is why the government\u2019s policy of nutrient neutrality is so important to ensure that new housing doesn\u2019t make the situation worse. Read more on our previous blog."

We will continue to work with land managers interested in becoming a mitigation provider and look to expand the range of options available for securing mitigation. We will also continue to look at opportunities to simplify and speed up the delivery of solutions on the ground. "

So far, Natural England, other providers and developers have collectively generated mitigation to enable around 50,000 homes.

            "text": "The goal to aim for is one where nutrient neutrality advice is no longer needed by getting our legally protected rivers and wetlands back into good condition. This is a big challenge and we will need all sectors and strong partnerships that draw on all the tools at our disposal to address it. It is welcome news therefore that Government will continue to support not just mitigation provision but also Protected Sites Strategies and other interventions that will tackle water pollution and improve our protected sites. This is good news for nature and for people. "
