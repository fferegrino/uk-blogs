            "text": "One of the major sources of pollution to rivers and lakes is excess phosphorus. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals but too much can lead to algal blooms and excessive plant growth. This in turn reduces the amount of oxygen dissolved in water, potentially killing fish and harming aquatic life."

Our modelling has revealed that around 52 % of the phosphorus in Windemere\u2019s north basin comes from sewage and approximately 48 % from runoff from both built up and rural areas. The sewage is from storm overflows, United Utilities and private sewage treatment works, and septic tanks."
