You might be wondering why my team is called the FAT Badgers\u2026 We were originally called the Honey Badgers (due to being fearless and highly intelligent) but then we redesigned Find Apprenticeship Training (FAT) so rebadged ourselves the FAT Badgers."

One Login will deliver a single consistent way for users to sign in and prove their identity to all government services, so being an early adopter was an exciting yet slightly daunting task! We knew we were in safe hands as services such as Disclosure and Barring Service basic check (DBS), Apply for a vehicle operator licence (DVSA), and Register to be a Social Worker service (SWE) had already joined GOV.UK One Login."

The onboarding process involved working with the team in GDS to sign a memorandum of understanding, reviewing user journeys, planning our communications, and testing the service. After months of hard development work, our services migrated over."

We initially had some development difficulties as a lot of our services were using outdated Microsoft framework versions which did not support the updated security packages that were required for the integration to work. Now GDS can use our work as an example to support other teams which is a win-win for everyone."
