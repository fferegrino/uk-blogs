The validity of GMP and GDP certificates has currently been extended until the end of 2023.\u00a0 The MHRA (in consultation with our international partners) has decided to continue the extension of the validity date until 2024[2] or until the conclusion of the next inspection, whichever comes first, except where clarifying remarks in the certificate state otherwise."
