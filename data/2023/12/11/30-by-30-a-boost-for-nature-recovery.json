Central to our work in Natural England is the role of nature in helping tackle climate change, and how nature can become more resilient and adapt to its impacts.\u00a0"

This target will be a key driver in reversing the decline of nature in the UK, by expanding and improving our protected areas and creating new areas for wildlife, allowing nature to spill over into the wider landscape.\u00a0"

OECMs are voluntary areas, which must primarily be managed and protected for the long term for biodiversity, as laid out in Defra\u2019s criteria.\u00a0"

This should be seen as the start of a process to optimise the network, and as an opportunity to achieve meaningful and long-term recovery of our wider seas.\u00a0"

Above this new Local Nature Recovery Strategies, typically led by Local Authorities, will set out local plans for how this nature recovery will be done. All of these will need to work together to deliver for nature. These new measures will work alongside more established conservation tools such as SSSIs and National Nature Reserves, of which we are creating 25 more as part of the \u201cKings Series\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

We will continue to work with Defra and our partners to ensure the OECM evaluation process is up and running as quickly as possible. This will enable our partners such as environmental charities, farmers, woodland owners, developers delivering biodiversity net gain and other major landowners such as government departments, water companies and Crown Estates, to name but a few, to help us achieve 30x30.\u00a0\u00a0"

But in doing this, we must ensure that the key tenets of 30x30 are not diluted. We need to ensure that this is not just a counting exercise and that we have a plan in place to ensure that there is a legacy after 2030 as the world looks to a 50x50 target. There will be the need for robust assessment criteria for protected areas and OECMs that provide confidence that they deliver long term for nature\u2019s recovery and deliver functional ecosystems.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "If we are successful, 30x30 will not only help deliver our species and habitats targets. It will also increase and improve the condition of our protected sites (SSSIs, NNRs, MPAs) \u2013 driving positive biodiversity management in Protected Landscapes and beyond.\u00a0And it will give all of us more opportunities to enjoy nature for our health and wellbeing, as well as contributing to climate resilience and mitigation. If we can get the pipeline starting to flow with quality proposals that can become OECMs it will be a huge achievement. The next few years will be key."
