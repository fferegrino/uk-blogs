Launched in June 2022, the consultation sought views on the high-level principles of MNG. It proposed how best to introduce a Net Gain policy for the marine environment and in March 2023, participants responses were released. They showed broad support for MNG as well as a range of recommendations around what MNG could cover, how it could be applied to developments within it and which Net Gain interventions would be most appropriate at sea.\u00a0\u00a0"

It builds on the Government\u2019s progress with Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG), which applies to terrestrial areas and down to the mean low water mark. It confirms their wish to ensure that MNG has biodiversity at its core but also allows for inclusion of wider environmental benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
