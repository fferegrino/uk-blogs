This includes automating our services for updating registered titles, which makes up the majority of the work handled by our caseworkers."

            "text": "To automate our services, we need to adjust how we receive and process applications. At the moment, our caseworkers check every application for errors or omissions before starting work on them. They often need to send out requests for information (requisitions). It\u2019s essential to the integrity of the land register that these details are correct on the application. We need to remove this time-consuming step if we want faster, automated services."
        },
        {
            "text": "We believe that most of the checks our caseworkers currently perform manually could be replaced, either because our digital applications services check the register before the application is submitted or because our application processing tools can check it once it\u2019s been received. However, we also need assurance from customers \u2013 notably from those regulated lawyers or 'Regulated Legal Professionals' (RLPs) \u2013 on some other aspects. You may have heard this process referred to as 'Lawyer Assured Information' (LAI). For more on how this could help with our automation ambitions, please see our previous blog on \u2018efficient land registration\u2019.\u00a0"

So, we\u2019ve started with four high-volume firms: Enact, Eversheds Sutherland, Optima and O\u2019Neill Patient. We have been working with these four firms because their high volumes provided enough example cases for us to quickly understand how things could work. We\u2019ve been focussing on applications to register new charges, because they\u2019re relatively simple to register, and they make up a sizable proportion of our work."

We will not allow applications which do not pass fundamental \u2018business rules\u2019 \u2013 things which our caseworkers currently check for \u2013 to be added to the register."

We will now include a broader range of firms of different sizes, handling different amounts of cases, to ensure our approach works for everyone."

This may, for example, be by checking each individual application. Or alternatively they may only need to check a sample of their firm\u2019s applications, as they have enough confidence in the processes and assurance checks in place. Any steps taken by the RLP must give them a reasonable belief that each application being submitted to HM Land Registry is true and accurate."

These more functional aspects are fundamental to this working in future, so we will continue to work with these firms and test our approach with a broader range of customers."
