Ensuring our web content is accessible is a big part of what we do, this includes writing in plain English and for compatibility with assistive technologies, such as screen readers. This means our content is inclusive and can reach the maximum number of users. We also work on content-improvement projects, whether that\u2019s updating the ONS content style guide or developing new content types to suit user needs. We use evidence and analytics to help inform our user-centred decisions and designs."
