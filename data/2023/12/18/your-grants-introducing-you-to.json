In this series of blogs, we look at the grants available in more detail, using case studies to showcase those who have taken advantage of these opportunities, as well as highlighting the work of the RPA Grants Service Team in administering them. In this blog we meet Debbie Gray who works on the development of new grants."

            "text": "We have just launched Improving Farm Productivity Round 2, so we\u2019ve been very busy getting ready for that, and I\u2019ve written a lot of technical guidance.\u00a0The grant is open to horticultural and farming businesses and will pay for capital items to improve farm and horticulture productivity. It focuses on the use of\u202frobotic and automated equipment and systems to aid crop and livestock production and the installation of solar equipment to increase energy resilience and take-up of renewable energy generation."

            "text": "We do a lot of work behind the scenes before a grant is launched. You have to work out what\u2019s right to make available for the current time, ensure consistency and accuracy of the guidance, as well as consistency with other available grants and schemes. We work with DDTS colleagues on the first stage application \u2018online checker\u2019 process.\u00a0 This involves a lot of testing of the systems so when the grant is launched everything goes smoothly. We reach out through the Customer Insight Team for volunteers, such as farmers, who test for us. It\u2019s also very important that the guidance we produce is straightforward, concise, and clear to make it easy for farmers to understand and apply for the grant.\u00a0 Customer content colleagues are a great help with this as this has to be the case from the first publishing of information, through the online checker and right up to the full application form and guidance products customers will use."

Before joining RPA, I worked on farms when I first left school, and also for North Yorkshire police in the control room. I only came to RPA for a three-month temporary role, but I really enjoyed it and never left. I can\u2019t imagine ever leaving the Grants Service team."

            "text": "I would say that the aspect of my role I enjoy most is the collaboration with colleagues, as well as the complexity and detail of what I do. I don\u2019t deal directly with the customers who are going to be interested in grants, but I deal with everyone else who has a vested interest in the grants such as wider Defra, farming stakeholders and ministers. I used to love talking to customers face-to-face in my previous role, and I do miss that."

I\u2019m a member of the Cross-Government initiative\u00a0 CERAE, that supports those who are care experienced, refugee or estranged. and I\u2019m very passionate about that. Before joining RPA. I was a foster carer for 14 years, along with my husband. We have three sons aged 21, 12 and 10, and over the years we\u2019ve fostered around 30 children both long and short term."
