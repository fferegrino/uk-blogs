Launched on 1 April, as a fully fledged service, and mandated by ministers as the place to advertise all government grants - with very few legitimate exceptions. This cross-government digital service has driven efficiencies and improved access to grant funding by standardising the advertising of most government General Grants in a single location. We project that the service will advertise c.\u00a340bn of grants across fifteen departments by the end of 2024/25. So far 179k people have used Find a Grant, and \u00a37.6bn worth of grants have been advertised, and applicants just LOVE it. One place to find and apply for all government grants."

As standard, we have included all the mandatory questions you need to run your due diligence checks and you can adapt the form to suit your needs - with a drop down menu for the types of questions you might need to ask. \n\nYou can use this new feature now if you have already registered for a Find a Grant account and asked us to add your admin permissions.\u00a0"

So when any application is submitted, it is now immediately ready for checks to be run against it on Spotlight - at any time. There is now no need to download spreadsheets and transfer data manually.\n\nOur colleagues are also continuously improving Spotlight to automate pre- and post-award checks to highlight risk, financial health and potential reliance on grant funding, and inform effective risk-based grant making decisions on the allocation of funding."

GGMS will be digitally-enabled, using all of the services we\u2019ve just talked about, to create an efficient service, generating greatly improved data insights. In the new year, I will be able to update you some more."
