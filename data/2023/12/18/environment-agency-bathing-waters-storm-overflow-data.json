This data, provided to the EA following the end of the bathing water season (May to September inclusive), is a vital tool for the organisation to plan what work needs to take place ahead of the next season and to work with water companies and local organisations to take action where needed."

It is now 90%, with 96% reaching minimum standards. You can read more about the annual results published earlier this month."

This is an increase from an average of 5.6 spills per overflow and an average duration of 3.2 hours in 2022. This increase is largely explained by the increased rainfall during the 2023 bathing water season (353.7mm, 111% of the long-term average) compared to the 2022 bathing water season (236.5mm, 74% of the long-term average)."
