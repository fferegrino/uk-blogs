Globally, it is recognised\u00a0that \u2018traditional\u2019 blue carbon habitats, such as mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses lock up large quantities of carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, further contributing to climate change. New research suggests that other coastal ecosystems, such as marine sediments (including intertidal and subtidal), macroalgae (kelp forests) and plankton could also provide an important source of marine \u2018blue carbon\u2019 not yet fully considered in the fight against climate change."

            "text": "In the UK, blue carbon habitats typically refer to saltmarsh, seagrass, seafloor sediments, kelp forests, and mangroves found in the British Isles and UK Overseas Territories. As well as capturing and storing organic \u2018blue carbon\u2019, these habitats offer a range of benefits, such as providing nursery grounds for a variety of fish species, filtering contaminants and nutrients to improve water quality, and creating a buffer to help protect against sea level rise, flooding, and coastal erosion. Unfortunately, like many blue carbon habitats globally, UK blue carbon habitats are also now seriously degraded. Land use change, dredging, construction, sea level rises due to climate change, and trawling have had impacts on the UK\u2019s coastal and marine ecosystems. Since the mid-1800s the UK has lost 85% of its saltmarsh, resulting in loss of habitat and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."

            "text": "Evidence suggests that the management, protection, and restoration of blue carbon habitats, through mechanisms such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), could play an important role in mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change and supporting the UK\u2019s Net Zero commitments. However, while the science in identifying and measuring carbon stocks in terrestrial carbon habitats, such as forests, much less is known about the blue carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems and therefore to what extent their management and protection could contribute to nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation."

Offshore\u00a0shelf sediments cover around 9% of our oceans and store large amounts of carbon, however, they are not yet fully recognised as having the potential to contribute to\u00a0climate change mitigation, and are therefore not protected for this purpose, by international agreements. In the UK, carbon storage and sequestration of the English shelf seabed has been shown to be important for climate regulation, and the existing Marine Protected Area (MPA) network \u00a0currently stores a third of all the carbon stored in seabed across the UK."

The research also includes developing and testing a blue carbon \u2018toolbox\u2019 of methods to help scientists understand where carbon stocks may be at risk due to their vulnerability and when management of carbon in seabed sediments may contribute to climate change mitigation.\u00a0 We are also assessing the impact of trawling on the relationship between biodiversity and seabed carbon storage, and will use predictive models to explore how different marine management approaches could impact the potential of the seabed to store or emit carbon."

            "text": "Cefas has also been exploring how carbon sequestration acts as a climate regulation service, to understand the potential economic and societal costs if this carbon storage or sequestration service was degraded. For example, a recent paper estimated that damage caused by human activities and climate change over a 25-year period could cost the UK economy up to \u00a310 billion in damages, \u00a0due to coastal erosion and loss of key ecosystem services. \u00a0A follow up paper explored the need for new accounting guidance and governance frameworks to manage carbon in shelf seas. \u00a0A key aim of the mNCEA work is to develop a nationally standardised way of measuring, monitoring, (and hence valuing) carbon stored in the seabed and to develop technical guidance that will build a consistent evidence base to support policymakers and better develop strategies aimed at activity management, including the use of MPAs, to aid their protection and recovery."

            "text": "Seagrasses are recognised as a highly important coastal habitat for combatting climate change. Some species are up to 35 times more efficient at absorbing carbon than rainforests of the same area, and despite only covering 0.2% of the ocean floor, seagrasses store up to 10% of the ocean\u2019s carbon. Unfortunately, in the UK, seagrasses are threatened by disease, pollution, and physical disturbance from activities such as the anchoring, launching and mooring of leisure boats. While it is estimated that 44% of the UK\u2019s seagrasses have been lost since 1936 alone, efforts to replant and restore seagrasses, such as England\u2019s largest seagrass restoration project have increased with pace."

We have also been exploring how \u00a0to harness the power of computer science and colour physics to better survey seagrass and saltmarshes and describe their presence around our coasts and to monitor changes. This has included working with imagery from remotely piloted aircraft (\u2018drones\u2019), using machine learning and looking at how we can transfer methods used in mobile phone cameras to improve the quality of vegetation imagery."

However, there will always be trade-offs. As the concept of \u2018blue carbon\u2019 develops and our understanding of blue carbon habitats expands, Cefas will continue to work with UK and global partners to provide evidence- driven solutions to help policy makers and practitioners make the right choices for people and the marine environment and a sustainable future."
