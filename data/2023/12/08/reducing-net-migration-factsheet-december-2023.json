The latest official estimates show that net migration in the year to June 2023 was 672,000 - up significantly on pre-pandemic volumes but lower than the 745,000 who came in the year to December 2022."

On Monday 4th December 2023, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary announced a plan to slash migration levels and curb abuse of the immigration system, delivering the biggest ever reduction in net migration.\u00a0Together, this package will mean around 300,000 people who came to the UK last year would now not be able to come."
