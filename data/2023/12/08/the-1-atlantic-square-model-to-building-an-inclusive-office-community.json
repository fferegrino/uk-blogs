This ambition \u2014 to deliver a Skilled Civil Service that is inclusive and representative of the communities we serve and that provides a thriving presence across the country \u2014 is one of our five missions.\u00a0"

Over the last 18 months, Glasgow has made significant strides, proving its ambition to put Scotland\u2019s skills and experience at the heart of UK Government\u2019s policy-making and corporate services, and to support UK civil servants based in Scotland."

This December, the office will be welcoming colleagues from the Scottish Government, DWP and HMCTS to join the discussion."
