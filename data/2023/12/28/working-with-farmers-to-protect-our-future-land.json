These regulations govern the storage and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers, aspects of livestock management, and other aspects of farming infrastructure and practices where there is a risk of pollution or environmental harm. We check that farmers are compliant with the aspects of the regulations applicable to their farm and, where non-compliances are found, we take appropriate steps to bring a farm back into compliance."

The issuing of over 4000 actions so far shows that we typically find multiple non-compliances during those inspections. With 2165 actions verified as complete, farmers are making good progress in bringing themselves into compliance. Many of the actions we specify require significant changes to farming practice or infrastructure so these can take time to implement."

            "text": "Prior to a significant injection of funding and the establishment of our new teams of agriculture inspection officers in 2021, we can see that inspection numbers were low. Without dedicated officers, inspections were carried out by teams with a wide range of other responsibilities relating to land and water regulation. Fluctuations in inspection numbers earlier in the period relate to changes in funding and areas of regulatory responsibility."

        {
            "text": "Much of our inspection work for sectors outside of farming (such as waste management and abstraction licences) is charge funded through the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR). This means businesses pay for an environmental permit and the income derived from this is used to monitor compliance. Currently only a small proportion of intensive pig and poultry farms require permits to operate. The majority of farms do not require environmental permits, so the inspections we carry out are paid for directly by government funding \u2013 an anomaly in terms of environmental regulation."

Not all farms are in places where they present a risk to water quality and some farming sectors and practices have a much lower impact on the environment than others. Our aim is to reduce the impact agriculture has on our waterways, so we target river catchments taking into account a number of factors:"

We are a fair regulator, but if advice is not heeded, we will not hesitate to pursue whatever sanctions are necessary \u2013 including penalties, formal cautions, or prosecutions.\u00a0 We continue to innovate in delivering our regulatory role using remote sensing, aerial drones, and targeted campaigns on key issues like soil protection."

The map of England below shows where our inspections are being targeted this year. Whilst we use this process for proactive planning, we will also carry out inspections where concerns about pollution are identified, whether by ourselves, partner organisations or the general public."
