For example, a senior male colleague is working part time, initially as shared maternity/ paternity leave, and then a four-day week achieved through flexible PPA and compressed hours to share parenting and to support a work/ life balance.

This colleague worked part time to complete a PhD in Creative Arts. She\u2019s now returned to teaching full time and this CPD is really enriching her practice as well as equipping her to offer broader CPD to our school, and more widely across our trust. This example highlights that flexible working can be for a fixed amount of time, if that\u2019s what works for the individual."
