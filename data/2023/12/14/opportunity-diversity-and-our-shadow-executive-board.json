SEB comprises a diverse group of volunteers \u00a0at Grade 7 or below who bring equality and inclusion to the forefront of senior managers\u2019 thoughts through offering \u00a0advice on upcoming initiatives before they reach our Executive Board (EB)."

            "text": "I joined SEB for a few reasons. First and foremost, I wanted to contribute to fostering inclusivity in the workplace. Having observed instances of discrimination related to disabilities on numerous occasions, both in educational settings and the workplace, and recognising the profound impact it has on the individuals affected, I believe that promoting a collaborative and innovative environment will enhance well-being and provide equal opportunities for individuals, regardless of their background."

Lastly, it offered a unique chance to gain insights into strategic decision-making processes at a higher level, aligning with a personal development goal I had set for myself."

            "text": "During my time on SEB, I played a role in reviewing papers and providing constructive feedback on presentations before they reached the EB. This involved considering aspects from an Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) perspective, scrutinising data presentation, and thinking about the wider implications to the organisation. I also engaged with EB members directly, seeking ways to promote SEB initiatives, and communicating key insights from previous meetings."

        {
            "text": "Overall, I have greatly valued my time with the SEB. The experience has deepened my understanding of the wider organisation and its various functions, helping to foster a more holistic and open-minded approach to how I think about my work. Moreover, knowing that my input has positively contributed to advancing EDI initiatives and creating a thriving culture where everyone has opportunities to succeed been a particularly gratifying and rewarding aspect of my engagement."

As a part of this select group tasked with reviewing papers and initiatives before they reach Exec Board itself, I found great satisfaction in contributing to the shaping of a variety of strategies and policies."

            "text": "One of the most rewarding aspects of this role has been the exposure to cross-team working methods. Collaborating with diverse individuals from various teams has not only broadened my professional network but has also allowed me to witness the synergies that emerge when different perspectives and expertise converge. This cross-functional collaboration, combined with a further review for those presenting at Exec Board, I believe further ensures a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to decision-making."

The experience has undoubtedly shaped my professional growth and deepened my appreciation for the complexities involved in high-level decision making. I would recommend this kind of opportunity to anyone wishing to see a bit more about what is happening at the senior leadership level in their organisation."

I had never taken on a co-chair position before but was motivated to apply as, being autistic myself, I was passionate about supporting the development of a more diverse, inclusive workplace."

This was so that SEB members were able to offer advice on where they might be able to improve areas to make them more inclusive."

            "text": "I chaired these meetings, encouraging discussion between SEB members and presenters, who all engaged with enthusiasm. SEB members asked questions and made thoughtful suggestions, and the presenters who attended were delighted to receive our input. These meetings provided not only the opportunity to offer new ideas on how to raise awareness of inclusivity practices, but to develop my understanding of what was happening across our wider organisation."

This laid out what would take place before the meeting, with SEB members receiving papers to make notes on in advance, during the meeting, where we engaged in discussion and offered suggestions, and after, with meeting notes circulated to both presenters and the Executive Board, detailing our suggestions."

This gave me the opportunity to learn more about how decisions are made across Defra and was an invaluable experience."
