Using art-based activities and workshops, and linking with local schools, children were able to explore, celebrate and connect with their local coastal habitat around the bay, and with the creatures that have made this stretch of coastline their home."

The aim was to connect local young people and their families to the unique coastal heritage and nature around both Allonby and Maryport. The Laal Collective worked alongside the teachers and children at Allonby Primary, Crosscanonby St. John Primary and Holme St. Cuthberts Primary, to turn the project\u2019s ambitions into reality."

            "text": "We embarked on a project which would teach children about the unique, local natural environment; the creatures that live within it and the impact humans have had on the area. They then went on to create a story around one of \u2018The Three Herrings\u2019 featured on the flag. Their stories were informed by the factual knowledge that the children learnt through the project, but also brought a wonderful magical and imaginative approach to their tales."

This was complemented by the creation of their own school banner that celebrated local nature and wildlife."

We are dedicated to fostering partnerships and projects which allow for recreational activities, creating opportunities for people from all walks of life to connect with nature, in and around their local communities. We are working with partners to highlight the importance of time spent in the nature, and the many physical and mental benefits that come from being outdoors. Following on from the launch of the Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP) last year, we are committed to ensuring that we find ways to tackle the many barriers people face in accessing nature, which we hope will result in more people deepening their love and respect for our incredible natural world."
