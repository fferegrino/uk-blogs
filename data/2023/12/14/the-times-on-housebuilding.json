            "text": "Claims we have dropped targets are completely false. Our goal of delivering 300,000 homes a year remains, and local authorities will continue to have to calculate and justify their local housing need, informed by the standard method. Last year alone we delivered over 234,000 homes which was higher than at any point between 1997 and 2010."

            "text": "Since April 2010, over 2.5 million additional homes have been delivered; the four highest annual rates of housing supply in 30 years have all come since 2018. This is all clear evidence of a government that has consistently delivered on its promise to build more homes. At the same time, the number of non-decent homes has fallen by two million since 2010."

We are launching a new planning super squad to help speed up large scale developments. To tackle backlogs in the planning system, we\u2019re supporting the sector with the \u00a329m Planning Skills Delivery Fund \u2013 which received an extra \u00a35m at the Autumn Statement, as part of a \u00a317m package of planning measures to make it easier to get new homes approved and built."

Importantly, it will ensure we do not just build more homes but that we build the right type of homes in the right places, and put local communities at the heart of decision-making about developments. This will help create proper neighbourhoods that enhance the environment, and are built beautifully alongside GP surgeries, schools and transport links."

This included ambitious plans to accelerate developments in the heart of three cities that will: transform Cambridge into Europe\u2019s science capital complete with a new housing quarter; deliver a \u2018docklands 2.0\u2019 vision in East London creating 65,000 homes; and regenerate Leeds City Centre, removing barriers to help deliver up to 20,000 homes."

The National Planning Policy Framework is already clear changes to Green Belt boundaries should only take place if exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated. We consulted on clarifying that Green Belt boundaries are not required to be reviewed and altered by local authorities - but that they can still choose to do so where they can evidence that this is warranted."

Local authorities have to demonstrate they have such a five-year supply when they adopt their local plan. We consulted on a change that would mean authorities that have an up to date plan in place, with such a supply, will be freed from having to make annual updates - with a new supply required to be shown when the plan is updated."
