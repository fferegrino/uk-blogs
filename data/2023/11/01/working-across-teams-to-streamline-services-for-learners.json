It should support individuals to move seamlessly through their skills, training and career journey. Earlier this year the Department set up a new team with this mission at its core. Our unit has been thinking about how we can design, deliver and communicate our policy and services to achieve it."

For the first time, we've united our audiences (adults, young people, employers) into one single, unified umbrella campaign. The new strategy will motivate and inspire all three audience groups. It will make adverts featuring skills products more recognisable and impactful. It will simplify the customer journey with a single call to action and digital destination."

The website allows them to compare between the different training and employment schemes on offer. Initial user research from the Customer Experience & Design team highlighted that there was still more to do. We will continue to join up our digital domain to better meet the needs of young people and adults seeking information online."

Digital experts from different areas of the department came together with careers advisers, communications specialists and policy leads to find creative, innovative solutions that could help meet the 8 user needs. One example is the recently launched design system for the National Careers Service. This has started to bring better visual join up to the system, particularly through its recognisable bold pink colour."

The new model in DfE is beginning to show how we can all work together to make decisions that work for everyone.

Today though we are taking a step back to appreciate the great things that have already been achieved!"
