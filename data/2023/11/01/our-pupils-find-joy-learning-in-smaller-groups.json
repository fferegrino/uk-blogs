As our teaching assistants, especially in KS2, are graduates and have subject specialism which supports the learning of our pupils, we believed this approach would be most beneficial. Each of our school-led tutors undertook the NTP training and are quite experienced, as most have been in the school for at least 5 years and developed an understanding of our approach to teaching and learning."

            "text": "The initial focus for tutoring was KS2 \u2013 years 3 to 6. The pupils were then identified based on the data from their baseline assessments in September. We were clear that pupils must attend 3 sessions per week and that there would be no more than 3 pupils in each group. This meant the criteria for selection was very tight - we focused on pupils who were working just below the expected standard and struggling with specific area of learning in maths or English."

            "text": "Our pupils have fed back their joy of learning in smaller groups, as it provides a safe space, without other pupils\u2019 laughter or comments if they give wrong answers. Pupils also shared the importance of having dedicated time for the tutor to focus on them as individuals, and how it is easier to understand certain elements when in smaller groups. The attendance of our sessions has been great so far, contrary to when we used online tutoring. In fact, we now have pupils who keep asking if they can be on a waiting list for tutoring!"

It was the success of our tutoring at KS2 that allowed us to trial a phonics & bagel breakfast club. Our pupils receive a healthy breakfast, before being collected by their tutor for a 45-minute phonics and reading session. Following positive feedback from pupils, year 1 teachers, who were previously reluctant to the idea of early morning tuition for young pupils, have now set up their own breakfast sessions. All of our teaching assistants have been fully trained in the school\u2019s approach to phonics and reading."

            "text": "Definitely. I have found that the children we sometimes refer to as low achievers or pupils with low cognitive abilities, just need a different or more focused way to learn. As a result of tutoring, we have converted some of our low-key stage 1 attainers to greater depth in KS2. The focused approach means although we support less pupils, we can remove the learning barriers for those pupils."
