Piera is a chartered engineer and a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and she holds a BSc in Aerospace Engineering and an MSc in Aeronautical Engineering from Sapienza \u2013 Universita\u2019 di Roma. However, Piera didn\u2019t always work for the Civil Service. Her professional career has included roles at Rolls-Royce plc and McLaren Automotive, and we caught up with Piera to chat about her role to discover more about her career journey in engineering. "

At both Rolls-Royce and McLaren, I felt that I was at the cutting edge of really cool technologies, and that made the job much more fun! At Rolls-Royce, I was a Principal Aeroacoustics Engineer, collaborating with US and European partners and looking after one strand of Rolls-Royce's technology roadmap to reduce noise emissions. At McLaren, I was a Senior Aerodynamics Engineer, and I was responsible for the aerodynamic performances of a couple of our future supercars, working very closely with McLaren\u2019s design studio and using system engineering to optimise the overall aerodynamic design of the car."

            "text": "That\u2019s a really good question! When I changed jobs from Rolls-Royce to McLaren, I wanted to experience the engineering challenge of going from a long product lifecycle of about 20 years to a shorter product lifecycle of about 2 years. I wanted a similar type of challenge coming into Government, and for me, this has meant embracing the challenge of broadening my thinking beyond engineering and taking a bird\u2019s eye view of science and tech for the huge machine that is Government \u2013 so far, I think that this challenge has been very rewarding!\u00a0"

The complicated engineering products and challenges I worked on, be it how to design a quieter jet engine or how to aerodynamically optimise the front end of a sports car, have shaped the way I think, structure and approach problems in my current role. More importantly, in my engineering career, I was very lucky to meet and work with highly specialised and brilliant scientists and engineers who taught me early on the importance of passion for innovation and technology, and how to channel it into everything I do.\u00a0"

I feel that my role truly allows me to be a strong advocate for the use of science and technology in Government for the greater good. With my colleagues in the GSE Profession we are all using science and tech in Government to respond effectively to the challenges the UK will face in the future, and I am proud to be a part of this.\u00a0"
