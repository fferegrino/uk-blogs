First, I serve as a courier, taking information from the Command Group and distilling it down through our organisation. Secondly, I act as a thermometer, gauging morale and culture while fostering a sense of belonging. And finally, I serve as a translator, helping to simplify the sometimes-complicated language used in the Defence sector."

I've been in the military for 28 years, starting as an intelligence analyst and often deployed or working with NATO. When the opportunity at Strategic Command came up, it just felt like the perfect fit for me. I'm drawn to the idea of breaking through processes, cutting down bureaucracy, and pushing Defence to be better. Everything we do here feels new, and I love the fresh mindset our people bring to the organisation."

We often get the message that we need to be 'more' \u2013 train more, read more, and so on. But it's equally important to recognise and embrace the great qualities we already possess. When we bring our true selves to work, we can make the workplace a better and more genuine place."
