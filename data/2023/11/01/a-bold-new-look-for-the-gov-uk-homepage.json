Alongside search engines like Google and our own internal site search, it\u2019s one of the main ways into government content. It\u2019s also used to communicate the purpose of the site and to create a sense of trust between GOV.UK and our users."

We want to make it easier for users to access information and services, helping them to achieve quicker and better outcomes. We last looked at the homepage a couple of years ago, but we have not changed it significantly since 2014. We want to make sure that the homepage is as useful as it can be for all users and that it continues to reflect the innovative spirit of GOV.UK. Today we\u2019re launching the first of many significant changes to the homepage, including:"

We\u2019re building on a rich history of public sector design in the UK, including in our use of typography, which references road signage in the UK. But good design doesn\u2019t stand still and needs to evolve as expectations change. For example, a decade ago, only 20% of visits to GOV.UK were made from mobile devices. Today, this number is over 60%, and continues to grow."

            "text": "In response to this, as well as to other changes in user behaviour, we\u2019ve made the design of the homepage bolder and clearer on mobile devices. We redesigned the header area and increased font sizes and spacing throughout the page. There are less boxes on it and the layout is simpler. We also reduced the amount of text on the page by removing content that did not have a clear user need or that wasn\u2019t used much."
