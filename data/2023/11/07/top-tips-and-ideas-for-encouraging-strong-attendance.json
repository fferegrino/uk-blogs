The attendance hub enables schools with strong attendance practice to share their approaches with senior leaders in other similar schools to help them to improve. Hubs also facilitate an ongoing professional dialogue about attendance amongst school leaders on a peer support basis."

To kick off, we\u2019re offering free breakfast to all our pupils in the first week of term. We want pupils to be\u00a0 ready to learn and not feeling hungry, but we also want to show our commitment to their well-being and attendance from day one."

They get a stamp in their card for every morning and afternoon session that they are in school. They also get extra stamps for punctuality. At the end of the week, pupils get a number of entries into prize draw depending on how many stamps they have received in their card. We find this to be a very motivating incentive for the pupils \u2013 they really look forward to a prize draw at the end of the week!"

If the same pupils did not come in, , we made it a priority to call parents and make home visits to make sure that they are okay. Staff that conduct home visits are carefully selected to build relationships with children and families to promote strong relationships and, in turn, good attendance."

This calendar includes our attendance assemblies, parents evenings, workshops for families, and the dates in the school year where, as a team, we will look at our data to see how we are doing. We found this very helpful and we will be producing a calendar for this academic year."
