Engaging early will help make sure your LNRS takes account of your area\u2019s priorities and plans. This is important because recent amendments to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act will mean that all local planning authorities will have a duty to take account of their relevant LNRS. This duty applies generally, and to specific elements of the LNRS, including the mapped proposals."

You can find out which \u00a0you are in, and which local authority is leading its preparation. Where possible, you should get involved in LNRS preparation to help inform the priorities and specific mapped proposals. LNRSs are designed to \u00a0encourage and reward landowners for taking strategic actions for nature on their land, but it will not require them to do so. Where available on LNRS local websites, we recommend signing up for regular updates, so that you are informed on when to get involved. This will also ensure you know when the final LNRS is ready for you to use when making decisions. In the interim period before LNRSs are published, you can use an alternative strategy identified by your local planning authority."
