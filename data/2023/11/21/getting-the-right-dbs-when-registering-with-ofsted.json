For daycare providers, it is the provider\u2019s responsibility to carry out suitability checks on members of staff. \u00a0An enhanced criminal record check is an essential part of the suitability checking process."

Applicants often select the wrong type of DBS check, which can then delay submitting their application to Ofsted while they reapply for the correct one. We always encourage getting your DBS check from Matrix Security Watchdog."

For example, if you\u2019re applying to register as a childminder or live-in nanny, your certificate must state that it is for a \u2018home-based\u2019 role. Some applicants have worked in other parts of the early years sector before but have the wrong DBS check for these roles."

If your certificate is more than 3 months old, we cannot accept it unless you have subscribed to the update service, as the information contained with the check is no longer current. Although not mandatory, we strongly recommend subscribing to the update service."

We take a proportionate and risk-based approach to information contained in a DBS check. Some certificates that we process contain previous convictions, but this does not necessarily mean you are not suitable to provide childcare or be in regular contact with children. Our priority is to always consider what is right for children, and to reduce any risk of harm, as set out in our enforcement policy."

We aim to register applicants within 12 weeks, but this time only starts once we have accepted your application to register. If you use Matrix Security Watchdog to get your DBS, it will usually take around 4 or 5 weeks to receive your DBS through the post, so please factor this into your planning. Sometimes it is quicker, but it often depends on whether you're able to complete the stages quickly."
