            "text": "User research operations (ReOps) teams, which support user researchers / UX researchers to do their best work, are increasingly common. If you are considering setting one up, you probably want to learn from those who have trod the path before. I certainly did, when I established research operations at the Government Digital Service (GDS) in March-September 2022, joined in late July 2022 by the brilliant Uzma Razaq who runs it to this day. I learned a lot from Dr Salma Patel's blog about setting up research operations at NHS Test and Trace, Emma Boulton's work on pillars of user research, and resources from the global ResearchOps Community. This blog post summarises, in turn, my key lessons from what went well, and what did not, setting up research operations at GDS."

            "text": "At GDS, the benchmarking survey gave an initial sense of problem areas. However, to get a richer understanding of how our user researchers operated and the pain points they encountered, I ran a workshop at a community event. In small groups, I had researchers map the stages in a typical research project, record the pain points they encounter in each, and then vote on those that have the greatest effect on their impact. I later sorted these issues into the eight pillars of user research, and affinity mapped them within these. Arranging these by number of votes gave me a prioritised list of problems and problem areas."

It described our initial purpose, central missions, and our first steps to achieving them. If I had requests that sat outside it, it allowed me to explain why I couldn\u2019t currently support them, what I was prioritising instead, and why. That said, we were clear it would respond to the changing needs of our research community."

I worked with other parts of the organisation such as the highly supportive Privacy Office and Information Management teams. I organised community activities such as a (thrilling) \u2018research data spring clean\u2019 to get support in sorting out our shared drives. And for some research operations activities, especially those successfully being conducted by others already, I was explicit about only performing a coordination role."

It was overcomplicated and needed a bit of a rethink."
