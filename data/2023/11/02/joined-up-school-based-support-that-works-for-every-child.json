            "text": "Most children who attend an Alternative Provision (AP) school have experienced a number of significant life challenges, including exclusion from mainstream education. I am very passionate that these children have the right to access the help they need, within their childhood, to help them reach their full potential and to reduce the need for service involvement in later life. As services, we just need to work a little differently and more creatively to ensure that we provide this support in a way that works for these children."

Support is holistic, recognising and responding to the needs of family and wider support networks."

            "text": "Many of our children have had numerous services involved in trying to support them and their families throughout their lives, and they have not always been positive experiences. For example, many have previously been referred to mental health services but have not been able to engage with the standard model of support offered, and so have not attended appointments and subsequently been discharged."

            "text": "I work with children in a way that works for them, meeting at their chosen learning centre, out in the community, at home or at a CAMHS clinic local to them. I help them attend their session by whatever means necessary. For example, having a snack or their favourite drink prepared for them, which helps to build rapport and trust."

            "text": "Much of my work involves re-building trust between children, the school and other specialists in my team. For example, by developing a trusted relationship I recently supported a young person and helped her work with the Assistant Educational Psychologist in our taskforce on an ADHD assessment. At the same time, the family worker in our taskforce was able to work closely with the child\u2019s family, making the support she received truly holistic. As a result of our combined support, this child has gone from not wanting to sit a single GCSE to wanting to do all of them, as well as meeting with a career advisor and visiting different colleges."

Working in this way has allowed me and the team of specialists to support the \u2018missing children\u2019 in our communities, who are not offered the same opportunities as other children who attend mainstream education."

Although this was initially overwhelming for the family, our combined skills and expertise meant we were able to earn their trust and work with the child on attending school once again, with the necessary support in place."

Staff at the PRU say they feel supported and that CAMHS is much more accessible, and children are avoiding the waiting times they otherwise would have for support. This support is making a tangible difference to children\u2019s wellbeing, their relationships, and the quality of their engagement in school."
