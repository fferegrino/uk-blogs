This is open to all members of the GSE Profession to attend and is a space for members to come together to listen, learn and share ideas. Community of Practice meetings are designed to bring together people with a shared interest in a topic to network and share knowledge \u2013 for us, that topic is the broad space that makes up government science and engineering."

Within each meeting there is also designated space to spotlight or deep-dive into items from our members \u2013 these can be research areas of interest, signposting support that your team provides across government or presenting a topic for discussion."
