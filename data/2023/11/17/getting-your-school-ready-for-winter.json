            "text": "Do you know where to turn off the water in your school? It\u2019s a simple point, but an important one. Something you could consider installing is an actuated valve and a water meter linked to the building management system. This would enable you to turn off the water remotely and quickly in case of an internal burst. An actuated valve has a small motor attached to a valve that can be controlled by the building management system, so when an alarm is triggered, or unusual flows noticed, you can act quickly and and investigate the cause."

            "text": "To reduce the risk of burst pipes, I recommend you check that exposed pipework is lagged (insulated). This is not only useful to prevent freezing, but beneficial for saving energy as it keeps the heat in. Tanks should be insulated, but not from underneath as the heat from the building is used to stop them freezing."
        },
        {
            "text": "If any work has been undertaken on the pipes at your school, check the insulation has been replaced properly. To prevent freezing, activate your heating's frost protection setting and consider trace heating spaces with water storage/pipework to maintain the temperature above freezing. Trace heating is a where a small heater maintains the temperature of a space and/or pipes directly to prevent them freezing.\u00a0"

            "text": "When there has been an extended cold period and then sudden warmer weather, a \u2018freeze thaw\u2019 event can occur underground. Of course, just because you can\u2019t see the water, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a leak. A good way to check for hidden leaks is to read the water meter before and after holidays and shut off the internal pipework overnight to see if the meter changes. Lost water can be costly, so don\u2019t forget to claim the leakage allowance for sewerage charges if you have had a significant leak."

It could be caused by a temporary blockage or a more serious issue, and the water company is required to keep a register of properties with sewer flooding issues so always ask for a copy of their report."
