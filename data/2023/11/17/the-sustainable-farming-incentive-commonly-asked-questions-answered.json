We recognise that new questions may arise as even more farmers take up the opportunity. This blog will be kept updated with answers to questions as they come in \u2013 as we continue to support you through the agricultural transition process."

            "text": "SFI offers benefits for both for the productivity and resilience of your farm and for the environment it exists within. In the SFI scheme, there are 23 actions to choose from, sitting across eight areas \u2013 soil health, moorlands, hedgerows, integrated pest management, nutrient management, farmland wildlife, buffer strips and low input grassland. By applying sustainable food production practices on your farm, you could improve soil health, enhance farmland biodiversity or help mitigate the impact of extreme weather - all of which help look after your farm in both the short and long term."

For agreements issued in 2024 and onwards, your first payment will be four months after your SFI agreement starts. After that you\u2019ll be paid every three months, so you have regular, reliable income."

            "text": "Once a farmer has received their agreement for the SFI scheme, they will be paid over a three-year period to take environmental land management actions - to support farmers to manage land in a more sustainable way. There is also the opportunity to receive a one-off payment for a vet to visit your farm annually to review the health and welfare of your livestock and give you advice about improvements that could be made."

            "text": "The environmental land management actions in SFI will have benefits for both the environment and agricultural productivity. The scheme will help make agriculture more environmentally sustainable \u2013 but it\u2019s also about farmers continuing their vital role in producing food and has been designed with this aim in mind."

            "text": "Applicants are able to have a Countryside Stewardship or Environmental Stewardship agreement and an SFI agreement at the same time. This means you can combine SFI actions with other scheme options, providing even greater flexibility. However, applicants should be aware that actions must be compatible, and they can\u2019t be paid for the same action twice. Further information on this is given in both the \u2018SFI Handbook\u2019 and the \u2018How to Apply\u2019 guide which can be found on GOV.UK."

All farmers planning to apply should check their details on the Rural Payments Service and make any changes that are needed to avoid delays later in the process \u2013 mapping changes on average take around 2 weeks to process so it\u2019s best to ensure these are processed before starting an application. We\u2019ve published numerous resources to help advise applicants on how to do this. This includes the Handbook for the SFI 2023 offer, which sets out the full details of this year\u2019s SFI offer, to make sure farmers could plan ahead for their applications and autumn planting \u2013 this includes a section on 'What you should do before you apply for an SFI agreement'. We also issued a \u2018How to Apply\u2019 guide in September and published an accompanying video setting out how to apply for your agreement."

Once you\u2019ve submitted your application, the RPA will issue your agreement which will start the month after you accept it. However, if you can\u2019t apply online, for example if you don\u2019t have access to the internet or a computer, call us on 03000 200 301 and we can help you."

This will allow them to add more SFI actions and eligible land. Alternatively, if an applicant doesn\u2019t want to wait for the anniversary of the agreement, they can begin a new application for the additional actions on land, either within the current SFI agreement or new land."

However, (unlike Countryside Stewardship) SFI doesn\u2019t specifically require tenants to confirm landlord permission as part of application process."
