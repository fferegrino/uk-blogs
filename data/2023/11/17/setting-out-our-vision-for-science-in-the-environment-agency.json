Science plays such an important role in nearly everything the Environment Agency does, and this strategy highlights the organisation\u2019s unique capabilities provided through a combination of our scientific assets and skilled, often world-leading staff. It sets out our vision for science in the organisation to 2030, describing the broad areas of science where we will continue to invest in ourselves and work in partnership with others to achieve our ambitions."

Our science is purposeful, providing us with the insights we need to decide how to respond to the changes we are experiencing, underpinning our operational work to protect and improve the environment, and enabling us to assess the impacts these interventions are having."

It is also fostering and capturing innovation to advance the Environment Agency\u2019s work, supporting our planning for, and response to, incidents, and offering highly specialised scientific services such as horizon scanning. The strategy spans this huge variety of science, also highlighting the close links to data, social and economic sciences, and the interaction our scientists have with the Environment Agency\u2019s engineers and specialists."

Scientists in the Environment Agency have already developed partnerships across the UK with the Defra Group and other Government Departments, PSREs and public bodies, and research funders and academia. We also have several important international links with individual countries and multilateral organisations."
