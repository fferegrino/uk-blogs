The aim of this series is to showcase the people in the civil service who are innovating change, whether that be through being a learning champion, embracing digital and data into their daily working or helping develop new hubs outside of Whitehall. If you think you or your team have done work that channels reform and innovation, we\u2019d love to hear from you and showcase your achievements on our A Modern Civil Service blog."

            "text": "A Modern Civil Service is a skilled one, and when posed this question by Deepa, Sonia was keen to explore the idea of learning skills and capability. But how do we bring it to life and make it a reality for people? At the heart of a Skilled Civil Service, Sonia believes it\u2019s important to keep our knowledge and skills up to date, and stay aware of the skills, knowledge and proficiency levels for their professions. For leaders and senior civil servants, she encourages role modelling good learning behaviours such as progressing with continuous professional development\u2014and for all staff to review the Government Campus Prospectus online to identify knowledge gaps and promote curiosity in skills they might not have otherwise considered."

            "text": "Learning is lifelong and as the Executive Director of the Government Skills and Curriculum Unit, Sonia is a strong role model of that school of thought. She acknowledges that learning takes many forms and isn\u2019t just the sum of watching a lecture or presentation. The 70:20:10 model is one such learning model that prioritises learning from experiences, experiment and reflection, before supplementing that learning with working with others and planned learning sessions. However, Sonia recognises the importance of formal learning days for professional, team and organisational development.\u00a0"

            "text": "Many civil servants may identify with several professions, particularly if they have experience in other areas. Sonia has a background in psychology, but currently sits within the HR profession, so she is part of the HR profession, analysis profession and government science and engineering profession, and she encourages civil servants to join professions that link to perhaps previous career experiences, qualifications or new professional interests."

This might mean reserving time each week to facilitate that learning, in line with the civil service commitment for structured learning and development days."

What is important is role and profession clarity so you can access the right training and people needed to succeed. For Sonia, an emphasis on digital data skills is key to that success across all functions, professions and departments. Working towards STEM ambitions with the fast stream in science and engineering professions are part of that strategy, as well as recognising the worth of recruiting individuals with linguistic talents to improve the civil service\u2019s networking capability."

        {
            "text": "Ultimately, recruiting and training a skilled and knowledgeable workforce is at the heart of delivering the best service to the public. With over half the workforce in operational delivery roles, a breadth\u00a0 of skill sets and training must be available to suit the needs of every profession, function and department and have a good quality offer for everyone. The current apprenticeship scheme is one such example of highlighting potential aptitude in candidates to re-skill in a specific area, which is a great way of enabling that."
