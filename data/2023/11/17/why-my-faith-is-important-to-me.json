It keeps me grounded and assured in testing situations and seasons.\u00a0 To me, faith means believing in something even when you can't see it. It is my belief in the God of all creation - God the Son Incarnate, Jesus Christ."

            "text": "My faith in Jesus compels me to love, to respect and be gracious to others as He is to me. It challenges me to strive for a measure of selflessness beyond my natural ability as Jesus was when He gave His life for mine. My faith helps me to help others. I am passionate about people and being a part of a community, network, or team where I can serve, learn, and grow makes life meaningful for me. Any opportunity where I can support another in finding an answer to a problem gives me immense pleasure."

He embodies everything I know to be good \u2013 kindness, grace, mercy, forgiveness, patience, humility, faithfulness, and the list goes on and on! His ways, His truths are lasting and life changing."

Where I would otherwise be tempted to give an eye for an eye, I reflect on my own shortcomings and remember the grace that was extended by Jesus (and is still extended today when I mess up) and I am compelled to do the same."
