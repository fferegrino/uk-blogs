Though I've always enjoyed breaking down complex scientific stories to share with others, I joined the Environment Agency having no idea what a full-time career in science communication and engagement would look like, let alone whether I could do it."

Natural capital refers to the assets in nature (such as soil, water and air) which can provide services to humans (for example, carbon storage, flood prevention and water filtration). These services are affected by the health of the natural capital asset. My role is to examine how catchment sensitive farming advice has affected the natural capital assets on a farm."

I began by gathering lots of relevant publications and looking closely at how the researchers collected and analysed their data. Now, I am making a database to store these datasets, and I am designing a set of criteria to help scientists and policy-makers filter through research papers, identifying the ones that contain reliable and robust data, much more quickly."

I have been exploring how we can use this approach to visualise trends in the highest and lowest temperatures recorded at rivers over time, and I am investigating whether these patterns can be related to factors such as altitude or land-use. Next, I am going to look at how these projected temperature changes might impact the breeding and migratory behaviours of two important fish species: the Atlantic salmon and the brown trout."
