            "text": "First, it proved that a small team of people with no prior experience can be stood up quickly to take a lean UX approach to experimenting. Second, it shone a light on a universal problem \u2014 the size of HR enquiry backlogs."

        {
            "text": "Before LLMs, chatbots were often a source of pre-scripted answers. At most, the chatbot would breakdown user questions, highlight key words and return the scripted answer that was \u201cmost similar\u201d.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "With an LLM, it will still break the sentence down and analyse key words. But now, rather than fetching an answer from a list, it generates a string of words that it thinks are the most likely response to a question.\u00a0"

            "text": "Here, the model is fed business specific information (such as HR policy and guidance) and will only provide responses based on that information source. These models are rather complicated to set up, but will provide tailored answers and references to the source material."
