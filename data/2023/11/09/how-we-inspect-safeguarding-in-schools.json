You\u2019ll find lots of references to keeping children safe in education (KCSIE) too. That\u2019s because it sets out the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) expectations, as the regulator, of a school\u2019s safeguarding responsibilities."

Some of the concerns about getting decisions right in this space are natural. It\u2019s important to stress that inspectors will be looking at whether schools have made the right decisions to keep children safe, not looking to catch schools out on technicalities. We want the very best for children and protecting them from harm is paramount."

We\u2019ve updated our definition to take account of what we know matters most. We expect all schools to have an open and positive culture around safeguarding that puts pupils\u2019 interests first. \u00a0We have provided further clarification in our handbook at paragraph 367 on what this means. Inspectors will consider the safeguarding culture that has been established in the school when making a judgement. Judgements will rarely rest on single issues. Inspectors will take into account a range of evidence so that they are able to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements."

We\u2019ll do this in an age-appropriate way. And we will not automatically assume that anything worrying that might come up is representative of all pupils\u2019 views. If pupils do raise any worries, we\u2019ll make sure we share these with the relevant staff in school and test out views with wider groups.
