            "text": "We\u2019ve made huge progress in that time, and the sense of momentum building from the sector, technology suppliers and innovators is tangible. Many providers have jumped at the chance to access the funding and support available and are positive about the opportunities technology opens up to improve the ways they work, and how they support people."
        },
        {
            "text": "Providers have matched this enthusiasm with their own time and financial investment, in the knowledge that digital social care records (DSCRs) and care technologies can make their organisation more efficient and improve the quality and safety of care. It\u2019s also been heartening to see the early adopters support others in the sector, sharing their experiences and best practice."

Major programmes rarely go entirely to plan, but we\u2019re listening and learning and always striving to find the best way to respond to the sector\u2019s needs."

            "text": "As it stands, more than 60% of providers now use DSCRs - from a starting point of just 40% - with many more in the process of implementing the technology. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not on track to meet our target in the spring, but we\u2019re actively working to make sure providers don\u2019t miss out."

            "text": "Our analysis shows the very largest and smallest providers are least likely to have made the switch from paper to digital. There is also significant regional variation in uptake, with some parts of the country further ahead than others. While we expect some Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to reach the 80% target on time, we know this won\u2019t be the case everywhere."

            "text": "With this in mind, we have developed a scheme specifically for the largest providers to access funding directly, rather than go through multiple integrated care boards (ICBs). We\u2019ll be doing more work to understand the needs of the smallest providers and to explore how we can improve our support for ICBs with the furthest to go."

This integration of DSCRs with GP Connect will be a requirement of all assured suppliers next year and a major step forward in our work to join up systems between the NHS and social care."
