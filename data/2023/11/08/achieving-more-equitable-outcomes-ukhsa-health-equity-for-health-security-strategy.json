In other outputs, we have highlighted the burden on inclusion health groups - including those with social risk factors in the Tuberculosis in England report, and the Shooting up report which summarises infections and other injecting-related harms among people who inject drugs in the UK."

These are: people in contact with the criminal justice system, vulnerable migrants, people experiencing homelessness, place-based inequality and a continued focus on ethnicity and deprivation. With this focus, we have increasingly adopted a people and place approach; considering and addressing the context in which we provide health protection. This has included addressing the specific needs of these populations during adverse weather; working with colleagues across the health system to update guidance to support health outcomes of migrants; and exploring how we take this people and place approach further through our regional health protection services."

UKHSA has also joined with Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHSE to become a partner of the Voluntary Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) Health and Wellbeing Alliance, providing UKHSA with a co-ordinated way to reach VCSE organisations and hear the voice of communities."

A key learning from this conference was the importance of lived experience throughout the work that we do. Over the next year, we will build our approaches to partner with people with lived experience in the design, delivery and evaluation of our work, and continue to encourage this in our partnerships with industry and academia. Additionally, the 2023 UKHSA Conference will have a health equity \u2018track\u2019 of sessions."

This has included establishing UKHSA\u2019s values of \u2018impactful, insightful, and inclusive\u2019; maintaining 12 staff networks; and piloting a new development programme for staff from ethnic minority communities or with a disability. We are also improving understanding of health equity across our staff; we have delivered training to raise awareness around Health Equity, CORE20PLUS and the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) to nearly 400 colleagues, and created a Health Equity hub to support colleagues with information, tools and resources."
