The guidance also aims to support equitable access to greenspace across the country, with an overarching target for everyone being able to reach good quality greenspace in their local area so that more people realise the well-being benefits of time spent in nature.\u00a0"

Green and blue infrastructure is a practical response to the climate, public health, and biodiversity crises. Planners, developers, and community groups all have important contributions to make to ensure that green infrastructure is integrated into towns and cities across England, securing spaces to work, live and relax, and guaranteeing a habitable future for generations to come."

This is important because as towns and cities grow, plans are in place to establish green infrastructure at the heart of design, securing essential health, well-being, and economic benefits for residents. As a living tool, green infrastructure still needs to be designed and managed to adapt to and be resilient to climate change."

Launching in Spring 2024, version 2.1 will incorporate data from the 2021 census, new urban habitat data for cities including Greater Manchester and Birmingham, and new thematic information such as more detailed data on urban heat vulnerability. It will also trial the inclusion of data on sustainable drainage in the built environment."

To combat this, planners, ecologists, and community groups can create spaces incorporating green infrastructure (GI) design to build resilience so that people, communities, and systems are better prepared for climate change.\u00a0"
