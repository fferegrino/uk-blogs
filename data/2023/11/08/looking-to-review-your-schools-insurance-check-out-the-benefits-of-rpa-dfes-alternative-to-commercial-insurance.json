It operates on a no material fact disclosure basis, so we don\u2019t need estate, buildings or contents valuations and we don\u2019t review your school's risk rating. Another bonus is that there is no annual renewal process. Your membership will simply roll over to the next year, so you don\u2019t even have to think about that."

Depending on the circumstances, financial support is available to either improve risk management or invest in solutions that are likely to reduce future claims. Where solutions are proactively instigated, they reduce the need to close schools and classrooms and all the disruption that comes along with that if an incident were to occur. There\u2019s more information about this in our Keeping everyone safe and secure in school blog post."
