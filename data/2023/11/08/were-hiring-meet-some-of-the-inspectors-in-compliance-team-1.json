I am responsible for the GCP inspection programme and the recruiting manager for the current GCP inspector vacancy. After completing my BSc in Medical Biochemistry and MSc in Toxicology, I realised that I wasn\u2019t suited to life in a laboratory (for some reason, I would always have something go awry in my experiments)! I learned about clinical research and was immediately drawn to wanting to make a difference and help patients receive lifesaving/changing medicine. I started as a clinical research associate (CRA) in the pharmaceutical industry in 2008, progressing to a quality compliance role, then quality assurance as an auditor. I joined the MHRA as a GCP inspector in 2014."

Following the inspection, I had a mindset change and couldn\u2019t look at monitoring in the same way. I was delving into root-causes of issues and wanting to look at the bigger picture in terms of impact. I decided to apply for the role of GCP inspector as I am passionate about championing the voice of patients and keeping them safe. By joining the MHRA, I was able to do this not just within one company, but across the clinical research arena. You\u2019ll read below that most inspectors applied and thought that they wouldn\u2019t get the role, I was one of them too. Applying and saying yes to the role, was the best decision in my career so far."

The role has also allowed me to balance my family commitments as a working mum of two small children, who keep me on my toes!"

I have been at the MHRA for 17 years so I have seen plenty of changes in the world of clinical trials since I joined in 2006 shortly after the introduction of the Medicines for Human Use Regulations in 2004. I initially qualified from university as a Biomedical Scientist but fell into the world of hospital pharmacy where I initially trained as a pharmacy technician; once qualified I moved into aseptic manufacture within the NHS followed a few years later by commencing training to become a Qualified Person (QP) within the NHS. This led to a role in clinical trials as I gained broader skills to support my QP training. At this time the clinical trial regulations and the conduct of clinical trials were very different than they are today and eventually I ended up leading the provision of pharmacy clinical trial services within my NHS Trust. In 2006 I was encouraged to apply for a GCP Inspector\u2019s post by my manager and I admit to applying so that I could cross it off the list when I didn\u2019t get it and continue down the path to becoming a QP. Following the selection process I was offered the job and it was a significant turning point in my life as it meant leaving the NHS and becoming a civil servant and starting a life \u2018on the road\u2019."

By becoming an inspector this massively changed my \u2018reach\u2019; if I do a good job then it could potentially impact the current participants involved in that clinical trial as well as any future patient taking medication that had been tested as part of that clinical trial. This has always been a massive driver for me."

The exposure to the development of cutting edge treatments and technologies, looking at the multitude of ways that a process can be undertaken, the changes to technology and ways of working, meeting interesting people and the ability to effect change globally through partnerships and exchanges of information with other regulators and stakeholders are always examples of that. It\u2019s a vertical learning curve when you start life as a new inspector and it remains steep thereafter but it\u2019s always interesting and challenging. Once qualified there are multiple directions that you can take whether that\u2019s developing additional technical skills within a particular area, cross-training with another inspection team or developing management skills. I have done all of these and I continue to enjoy it every step of the way. We are a close-knit community of inspectors and you are never alone - help, support, encouragement or a suggestion is only ever a phone call away."

I did not think that I would make the grade to become an inspector as I hadn\u2019t worked in industry. But what I did bring to the role was broad exposure to many areas such as a basic analytical background from my degree, knowledge of the NHS, exposure to GMP and GCP, experience in computer system development, involvement in national pharmacy training provision and an appetite to learn and make a difference. So embrace your life\u2019s journey to date and let us know what you can bring to the team as our next inspector."

Going back to my first point, it\u2019s really the people in the agency that make this an enjoyable role.

I therefore fell back on my plan B, which was working in the pharmaceutical industry. I subsequently worked for a mid-sized pharmaceutical company in Germany and then a medical information service provider.

While the role sounded exciting and like it would match with many of my skills and interests, I did not give it any further thought until the GPvP inspection team opened a recruitment round for a new inspector a year and a half later. I was keen to stay at the MHRA, but to develop further so I leapt at the opportunity to apply. In fact, my manager also encouraged me to apply as she thought the role might be a good fit for me \u2013 I am grateful for her encouragement to this day!

I had experience in case management, signal detection, PSURs and had been the Local Safey Officer at a medium sized company. I was contacted about the Inspector role at the MHRA and at the time declined to apply as I did not believe it was something I had enough experience or sufficient knowledge to be successful in applying for. After some persuasion, I submitted my application with the view that I would at least understand how the application process work and in a few years\u2019 time I would be ready to apply \u2018for real\u2019, but to my surprise I kept being successful though each round and made it to the final round at the assessment centre.

There are frustrations, of course, I am sure they come with every job but there are so many aspects I love about my role and I truly look forward to coming to work every day and giving my all. So what are the top 3 aspects I enjoy about the role of an inspector? Firstly, the amazing people I get to work with, I find the team inspiring, everyone works hard, has a valid opinion and everyone is encouraged to bring their strengths within the team and we celebrate the diversity we have. Secondly, the exposure I get, whether this is on inspection itself and seeing how different companies approach achieving compliance with regulations; training and presenting in front of large audiences; to speaking with other regulators and inputting to discussions on behalf of the MHRA; to imparting knowledge and experience with others, whether trainee inspectors or other departments. Above all the work is always diverse and stimulating. Thirdly, I am often out of my comfort zone, although this can be hard sometimes, it is a feeling you get used to and are rewarded with an amazing sense of achievement pushing yourself to achieve tasks you may not have had chance to be part of in other roles."

I then moved into the lab and spent the next five years moving between CROs starting as a lead stability analyst and happily settling as a formulation analysis study director before that CRO site closed and I found myself redundant. After the closure I ended up as a development scientist investigating scale inhibitors in the oil industry. Our ISO9001 auditor left to go on maternity leave which coincided with me returning after a health scare (which limited me physically) so I found myself taking on the audit secondment to get us through our upcoming re-accreditation. On the return of the existing ISO9001 auditor, and being unable to move around brine barrels anymore, I moved to another CRO for a few years before the manager of a local quality assurance consultancy headhunted me and convinced me to join their laboratories team (which I ended up leading)."

The variety of backgrounds in my own team alone shows that there is no set path to becoming an inspector and the majority of us have been inspected ourselves at some point so we know what it\u2019s like to be an inspectee. It is the very variety in my own background which I think helps me in my role. Being part of the laboratories team (as well as the wider compliance teams) is a huge part of why I love my job as the other inspectors are all very welcoming and supportive \u2013 and a lot less scary than I had been led to believe at previous jobs!"
