This autumn, we are hosting the first Data Science Community Showcase to celebrate the successes of our community, as well as those of other networks and communities supporting government analysts. The event will take place online over three days and you can book your place on individual sessions on Eventbrite. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to expand your network, showcase your work and hear from colleagues in government who use data science for the public good."
