This market is not dominated by large corporations per se, but rather populated with numerous premium retailers, interior design practices and architects specialising in commercial projects. This market allows us to compete on added value, originality, and heritage through a knowledgeable dealer network."

Now, we look to the future having gained buzz and traction within this territory, expanding sales by broadly splitting the global market into three segments; namely USA/North America, EU and Asia. This turns the page on an exciting new chapter for the brand as historically, Coolicon products were only seen throughout the UK."

            "text": "Europe has a well-established premium lighting industry, with many countries not only producing a significant number of premium historical brands but, in doing so, dominating their domestic retail and professional markets. Key European markets such as Scandinavia are dominated by a regional aesthetic which is designed specifically to pair seamlessly with local interior design styles. This acts as a further informal barrier to entry for imported products such as Coolicon lampshades. The same can be said of countries such as Italy, Germany and the Netherlands in particular."

Building on our British heritage and skills, we lead the way by telling a new story in these saturated markets. 90 years of heritage is one thing that new brands simply cannot compete with, and we\u2019re now thinking of the next 90 years!"

The Coolicon brand has been in the UK for 90 years and is synonymous with industrial pendant task lighting, with many of the original shades still in use today. This makes the UK stable market with a rich history but poses challenges for growth with the core product offering. We feel the key to sustainable growth is export. As turnover increases year on year it is clear to us that export sales are driving this. Export sales now account for around 75% of annual turnover."

After several months working on establishing a new distributor network and overcoming completely new legislative bodies, redesigning products for US compliance, the Coolicon lampshades are now well established across the water, with more than 200 of them hanging proudly in US interiors. It took 90 years for Coolicon products to reach North America, but they are definitely here to stay!"

Instead, we work to stable pricing for both parties, focusing on high-skill and high-quality products. This secures associated skills within the UK, job satisfaction and pride in one\u2019s work. We are true believers that pride should not be undervalued in the craft sector."
