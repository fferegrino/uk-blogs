To show the impact of chemistry, we caught up with three chemists who now work across government. Let's meet, Ruth, a Scientific Adviser in MOD; Sam, Assistant Private Secretary to the Chief Scientific Adviser in DfT; and Amy, Regulatory Scientist in HSE."

            "text": "Ruth, Scientific Adviser\nI remember playing with my cousin\u2019s chemistry set when I was about 10 years old. We mixed a load of the chemicals together and made orange goo which came out of the test tube and made a stain on the carpet - that got me interested. When I was choosing what to study at university, I was undecided between food science and chemistry. However, on a trip to Leeds University (where I ended up studying) the chemistry department told me I should choose chemistry as it would give me more options. That turned out to be the best piece of advice as after leaving university, I have spent my whole career in defence."

        {
            "text": "Sam, Private Secretary\nI always loved science growing up, so choosing to study a science subject at university was a natural choice. Choosing which science to study was much more difficult! I was really torn between chemistry and physics, and in the end, I think it was chemistry\u2019s centrality that swayed me. Through studying chemistry, I could still study the elements of biology and physics that I found interesting, like biochemistry and quantum mechanics. It also meant I got to avoid some of the bits I was less keen on."

This means I get exposed to all the interesting and exciting ways that science can influence the transport sector, both today and in the future. I\u2019ve only been in the role for a few weeks, but the team have been incredibly welcoming, and are all super enthusiastic about the areas they cover."

        {
            "text": "Considering the residues of pesticides is my favourite part of my role. This is because I perform consumer exposure assessments which ensures safe consumption of food that has previously been treated by pesticides in the field. I find it extremely rewarding because my role is protecting the health of people. It\u2019s also really interesting seeing the pesticide products that are authorised on the market and seeing all the food on the shelves makes me feel that what I do is relevant and helps so many people."

            "text": "Ruth, Scientific Adviser\nGovernment is a fantastic place to be a scientist. I would recommend spending time as both a lab scientist and then in disciplines such as policy. If you can, get experience in industry too. Like any discipline, it is really important to build a wide network."

If you have the key skills and can demonstrate the desirable behaviours outlined in the success profiles then you have an equal opportunity to work for the civil service."
