It neatly describes the process of taking a proposal for a screening programme, assessing the evidence, stakeholders\u2019 views, its feasibility and other aspects and then, if it all adds up, working with policy people and the NHS to turn it into a live screening programme. This is major undertaking which involves economists, epidemiologists, evidence analysts, public health leads from local authorities, ministers\u2019 private officers, policy and finance colleagues, commissioners, doctors, nurses, patients, industry and many many others."
