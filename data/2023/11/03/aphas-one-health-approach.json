It means working to understand, anticipate and address risks to global health.\u00a0 Worldwide, nearly 75% of all emerging human infectious diseases since 1993 have originated in animals so the optimal and most cost-effective solution is to control the disease in animals, both nationally and internationally, thereby protecting damage to the environment and preventing the pathogen reaching the human population."

However, at 25\u00b0C live virus was detected in saliva, suggesting that bites could transmit virus should the virus reach the UK in susceptible vector species during the warmer months."

We have raised awareness of B.canis and brucellosis through an extensive piece of work to raise awareness among veterinary professionals, whilst continuing to test samples from animals as part of our roles as a National Reference Laboratory and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Reference laboratory/Centre for brucellosis."
