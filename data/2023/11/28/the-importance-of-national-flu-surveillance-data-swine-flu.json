These results go on to help GPs advise on suitable care for their patients and contribute to a wider understanding of the spread of respiratory diseases \u2013 informing public health policy. The data is also used to assess how well influenza and COVID-19 vaccines work in preventing illness in patients who would otherwise need to be seen by a GP."

These samples help better understand the effectiveness of vaccines and assess the overall immunity of the UK population. Many practices make use of the Take a Test postal swabbing service that enables telephone and video consultation patients to send in a surveillance swab, which can also be used for patients seen in person."

Data from the RSC is vital for our understanding of how to plan future public health interventions."
