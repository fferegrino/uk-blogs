It\u2019s easy to forget these events as temperatures cool again, but the ground beneath your feet remembers. The way that water flows across and into our landscape, over the months and years after rain has fallen or a dry spell has occurred, is one of the things that makes the science of drought so fascinating and challenging."

Having the latest science available is vital to keeping England on the front foot of resolving complex issues like drought in the face of a changing economy and climate."

            "text": "What makes drought so difficult to understand? Droughts are complex events that vary in duration, time of year, location, severity, and society\u2019s preparedness and response. The infrequency of drought means there is limited data and experience of them. This is further complicated by uncertainty in how climate change may impact drought in years to come."

Advances in climate modelling and new understanding of catchment processes, for example, could improve drought forecasting, response, and management. Meanwhile, understanding the social context of drought management could change the actions of regulators, water suppliers, and users."
