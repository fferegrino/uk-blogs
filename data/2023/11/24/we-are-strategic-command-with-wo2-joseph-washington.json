My primary responsibilities involve ensuring that discipline and G1 is adhered to for both my junior ranks and officers alike. This means ensuring my service personnel (SP) carry out their day to day duties in the highly professional manner expected of the Gunners, some of which involves, guard duties, day to day maintenance of the Sky Sabre (SkS) fleet, and integrated training with the RAF.\u00a0 This also includes keeping up detachment training on Sky Sabre to ensure we can deliver a 24-hour capability of detect, track, identify, and defend against enemy aircraft if needed."

I kick it off with some training at the gym and then every other day join in with collective battery PT run by the RAF PTIs\u2019. After my cup of coffee and lengthy session of tackling my inbox, I check in with my team to discuss the day's events. This is determined by the information briefed from the various RAF departments, which determines if we are conducting integrated training with RAF or conducting our own SkS training. Another significant part of my day is ensuring our Battery members are also focused on their personal and professional development, enabling them to progress with their careers."

For me, it means keeping their morale high, helping them evolve in their roles, and boost their confidence. Organised team activities such as Battlefield Studies, team sports and competitions, days out to see what Falkland\u2019s Islands has to offer, and battery cohesion events, these all directly contribute to building an effective team that want to continually push themselves personally and professionally, seeing this makes me immensely proud of my SP. It\u2019s a little like being a dad seeing their children grow."

This is my first deployment here, and I'm fortunate that it's during the summer deployment, so the weather is a nice bonus. It's an island, so you can expect some extremely windy days, but overall, it's fantastic, and I'm genuinely enjoying it. Just last week, I watched and supported my SP participate in a local half marathon to Stanley followed by a great lunch together overlooking Stanley Harbour. We also make time to explore the island's beauty, including the penguins and sealions in their natural habitat. Evenings usually mean team gatherings, there's a lot to do here and it's all about what you make of it. You can either stay in and get bored or go out, participate in activities, and explore the island."

It's the perfect playground for honing basic soldiering skills in different and sometimes very harsh environments. I often get the SP together to explore and use the unique landscape to deliver unconventional lessons. We're also fortunate to have The Roulement Infantry Company (RIC), currently The Welsh Guards, offering various equipment and weapons for training. Coupled with the unique terrain, it leads to fantastic training experiences and, of course, a lot of fun for the troops. We're always on the lookout for interesting places on the island to enhance our training and development, whether that is basic soldering skills or for our main trade craft as SkS soldiers."

With a unique and challenging terrain and extremely challenging climate, the phrase \u2018all four seasons in one day\u2019 isn\u2019t an exaggeration! Falklands provide an outstanding training environment which stands British forces in good stead for operational service anywhere and in any challenging environment."

It's challenging working out how the 3 services work and operate together, which is very different to what I am used to in the RA, but that's what makes it exciting. I come from a predominately technical and instructional background, I have worked on a few occasions with the RAF and Navy but singularly. This is my first tri-service experience since the HERRICK deployments, even then you tended to stay with your core. This deployment will definitely enhance my professional development and enhance my ability to work with tri service SP."
