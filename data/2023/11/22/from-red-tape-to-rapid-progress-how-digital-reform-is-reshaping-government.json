We want to move away from project-based and often slow and cumbersome processes to access funding, to funding consistent products, services, and user journeys based on the value they\u2019re delivering to the public. We're collaborating with HM Treasury and departments to create a new delivery-focused and performance-dependent funding model that supports teams to deliver faster, more innovatively and more productively.\u00a0"

For example, we are developing a Digital Readiness Check for policy, a set of key principles and questions to work through when developing policy or legislation, to ensure policy is designed to be implemented digitally from the outset."
