Public design is a term used to describe all types of design practices in the public sector that intend to deliver public value. The review brings together a diverse mix of people from the areas of policy, public spending, design, digital and academia.\u00a0The aim is to unite designers from all different disciplines around what we all have in common \u00ad- driving public value through design."

The review is taking stock and looking into how design has developed over the last 10 years in the public sector and how it might evolve in future. The review can only be credible and powerful if it amplifies the voice of all designers in the public sector, so it is very important that you take the time to complete the survey."

This is a complex process involving many actors with different needs interacting in different ways. Public design can \u201chelp you navigate that fog and do it safely\u201d, as one workshop attendee framed it. It\u2019s about avoiding assumption and providing certainty."

This also includes unlocking domain expertise in different contexts and turning experience and knowledge into insights and ideas. But designers cannot do this alone. Participants highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams, involving people inside and outside government, in central and local government, as well as collaborating with people in communities and academia - with the aim of all working together to co-design across services, systems, and sectors."

Participants talked about greater inclusion in all aspects of our work from more inclusive communication to more inclusive outcomes to having more inclusive management structures. Public design should facilitate all of those as well as should be facilitated by all of those. A retreat day attendee said:"

At the retreat day participants highlighted the need for better representation \u2013 breaking down national and social barriers so design reflects everyone. One idea that was mentioned was about having open living spaces or \u2018hubs\u2019 to be able to interact and design with citizens in an open, shared physical space."

A good infrastructure as outlined by participants includes access to data, tools, and resources as well as clear progression paths. What does a career path for a public designer look like? Is there a future for more designers in public leadership positions? Participants described strong design leadership as having more design awareness from the top, and public design being championed and embedded as an organisational strategy."

Given that our world is becoming increasingly complex, participants wish for leaders and decision makers with imagination. Imagination is what enables us to look beyond the world as it is and to imagine a better, more equal, and inclusive future. Participants talked about how public design can help making that bridge with democracy and helping make democracy better. So, one participant asked at the end: do we need a minister for design?"
