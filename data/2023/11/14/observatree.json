            "text": "Many people remember the impact Dutch Elm disease had on the removal of mature Elm from our landscape, and posters in police stations urging people to report. More recently, the arrival of Ash dieback prompted a national conversation and raised public awareness of the threats to plant health and the landscape."

            "text": "Set against this backdrop, ten years ago a bid for EU Life funding was made. The proposed project aimed to establish whether a network of specialist volunteers could be trained to look out for, and report on, plant pests and diseases of concern."

On the ground, our exceptional inspectors have delivered in-field training to volunteers. To date some 200 volunteers have been trained in recording and recognition skills for 24 priority pests and diseases."

            "text": "The first post COVID-19 session, in the Wyre Forest, was particularly memorable. We had all been inside for so long due to restrictions, so to reaffirm collectively with nature and the trees had a special significance. We learned the techniques for assessing tree crown condition, used back to basics trigonometry to calculate height and size, and met up with folk who until then we had only met online."

It has been key to supporting and guiding the project through the initial funding phase and beyond. Throughout, it has been the willingness of partners to work together to make Observatree a success which has been key in bringing this new approach to the table for identifying pests and diseases."

            "text": "The first big success came in the summer of 2015. Oriental chestnut gall wasp (OCGW) had just been found for the first time in the United Kingdom (UK) in a Kent woodland, and plans were being drawn up to limit its spread. An Observatree volunteer then reported it north of London, some 50 miles away. This prompted further surveillance by tree and plant health inspectors who found evidence of the gall wasps in many areas between. This altered our understanding of pest distribution, how long it had probably been in the UK and, provided an early indication of the potential of the Observatree project."

These absence data help us to understand the current extent of a pest or disease. The project is considering how all these data can be made available and shared more widely (for research for example)."

Others are thought to be heading our way, helped by increased global movement of goods and people, and changing climatic conditions. However, with the collective efforts of government, citizen science, charitable trusts, Non-Government Organisations and the public, we can perhaps be in a better position to detect and respond to these threats."
