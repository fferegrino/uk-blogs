She completed Pathway 2, a course designed for team managers, in July 2023. After graduating university in 2013, Rochelle spent time working in child protection services before progressing to a manager within fostering services. Rochelle experienced homelessness as a child so, even though she didn\u2019t have a social worker, feels that she can relate to similar experiences people who have been in care might have had. For her, social work is a way, a career, where she can support some of these children and families."

It was incredibly useful to connect with my peers, as I was able to build relationships and share ideas, which you don\u2019t usually have time for as a social worker day to day. Aside from the networking element, I wanted to develop my confidence in the skills I already possess and in the ones that still need development."

As a manager, I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to practice giving feedback, so having the space to practice this skill while receiving guidance from the facilitator was really useful. I\u2019ve already implemented one of the feedback models we were shown with my team and found that it helped people to digest the feedback more easily. Feedback is also so important when working with families - I will be looking at how I can use this model to help strengthen how we deliver feedback and to build relationships based on the value of giving and receiving it."

This gave me the space to really think about my local authority and if we were doing enough to encourage greater diversity and ultimately, I was left feeling that we could do more. My team\u2019s role is to recruit foster families, and we specifically struggle to recruit families from racially diverse backgrounds. The residential made me realise that we need to be having more conversations with families from racial minorities to understand what the barriers are to fostering and whether we can work with them to remove these barriers."

            "text": "My understanding of what a manager and a leader is has changed, and it also challenged me to think about what kind of leader I want to be. It\u2019s reframed my intentions for my role: I want to inspire, motivate and empower my team to come up with ideas and push them forward, and to be a facilitator rather than an instructor. Additionally, one of the other Pathway 2 leaders spoke about how we need to be shapeshifters, to adapt to the individual needs of the team member we are working with. Since the residential I\u2019ve been much more focused on considering how each team member would want me to approach a situation and involving them in the conversation rather than assuming it for them."
