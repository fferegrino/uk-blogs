This\u00a0practice uses language, questions, and a stance which allows the people we talk with to reclaim their power, their strengths, their resources, and their change. It\u2019s because of these reasons that I believe Solution Focused Practice can also help us reconnect with social work\u2019s identity and roots as interventionists."

In my experience, social work needs to move away from referring on and instead get on with intervening with those with whom we have already built relationships."

I have found that consistently applying a Solution Focused approach is impactful in co-creating change with families and leads to relationships improving - so many children are able to remain with their families. Their emotional wellbeing improves, hope for a future is regained, a trust in services returns and people can make the changes they want in their lives and ultimately no longer require social work involvement."
