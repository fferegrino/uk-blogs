Regardless of location, they live alongside and interact daily with people whose lives will be impacted by government policies: education, health, security, business, transport - you name it."

Our ambition is to create and promote policy careers across the UK, utilising the skills and talents of those with lived experiences who better understand the local cultures. It is a journey, one that we are progressing on slowly but surely."

About 40% of the profession are based outside London and this number is increasing steadily.\u00a0 My team in the government\u2019s central Policy Profession Unit is responsible for regional policy programmes to promote policy career pathways outside of London and to better connect policy makers, to build capability and create a more diverse culture.\u00a0"

            "text": "Since the successful pilot, the Policy Profession has established policy networks and programmes in the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, and more recently in the South West.

            "text": "As well as forming a policy network, each region prioritises their immediate needs. These can range from building a pipeline of local talents into the profession and the Civil Service, to holding policy roundtable discussions with local authorities and institutions.\u00a0 For example, the North East programme is looking at running a pilot cross-government red teaming exercise with a view to having regular red teaming opportunities. In Sheffield, roundtable discussions between policy professionals and local organisations include commitments on sharing data, growing and retaining local talents and achieving the city strategy."

They discussed their experiences of a full and rich career policy outside London without needing to move, and how the regional networks support the development of capability and careers in policy communities locally. This event is not just for existing policy makers but also for those looking to join the profession, which you can do so by signing up to the Policy Profession Network."

            "text": "This was followed by a cross-department policy induction event in Wolverhampton where we were joined by Elizabeth Thomas, Policy Adviser at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. She confessed that she was convinced she did not have any transferable skills that related to policy prior to the showcase. However, she successfully moved from an operational delivery post into her first policy role after the event. This was partly thanks to discovering the Policy Profession Network, which helped Elizabeth identify that the portable skills developed in her operational delivery role. The showcase was resounding proof that the power of networking, connecting and continuous learning is key to building a Skilled Civil Service."

Connecting with and learning from one another increases the synergy between work and learning and improves overall performance. It is knowledge, practical sharing and group mentoring rolled into one. No civil servant should feel isolated because of their location. The Policy Profession\u2019s Policy Festival is our annual event that brings together policy colleagues from across government, to share perspectives and learn from each other as well as make new connections.\u00a0"
