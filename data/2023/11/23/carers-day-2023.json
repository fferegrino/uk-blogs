Caring comes in many forms, for example taking care of elderly relatives, or neighbours who need support, or children with disabilities. Caring is not easy but it is often incredibly rewarding and it hones a myriad of skills which are invaluable in the workplace such as patience, empathy and understanding."

The benefits of a diverse workforce are well documented in the wider economy, in the civil service diversity in experience and skills can inform policy development and ensure better public services."

It is great to see an increased number of civil servant organisations gaining this accreditation. The Intellectual Property Office gained Level 3 accreditation in June, the highest level of Carer Confident recognition. Further, HM Treasury has achieved Level 2 status alongside the Department for Transport, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Cabinet Office. Congratulations to all departments which have achieved this recognition, it is important for more organisations to seek accreditation to ensure the workplace is as inclusive as possible."

Having never been in this position, I didn't know where to go for support and had little time to research what help was available. To compound things, my pride and misplaced desire for 'home life' privacy delayed me from making my colleagues aware of my caring responsibilities."
