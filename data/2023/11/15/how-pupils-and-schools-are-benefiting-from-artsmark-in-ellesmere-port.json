Through the teacher lunches, local cultural organisations have shared creative offers, school leaders have talked about how they prioritise arts, culture and creativity and creative practitioners have delivered some fantastic (free) CPD."

Through these partnerships, schools now have a selection of creative practitioners they work with on a regular basis."
