Systemic has been inspired by the world of board games, and was co-created by Policy Lab and Matteo Menapace, the co-author of \u2018Daybreak\u2019. It forms part of our learning from a project aiming to shift complex systems around multiple disadvantage with the Changing Futures Programme. Serious games are one of Policy Lab\u2019s new experimental methods, set out in the launch of our experimental innovation strategy last year. \u202f\u00a0"

Through our nine-month project for the Changing Futures programme in Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (introduced in our first blog in this series)\u202fwe learnt policymakers don't often have the time or space to consider the current policy system, and test possible deep-rooted changes. \u201cSystemic\u201d offers a space for reflecting on the current policy system works, and then play-testing changes that might lead to better policy outcomes.\u202f\u00a0"

It is particularly useful to understand complexity and intractable problems. Jennie Winhall and Charles Leadbeater suggest that that the following requires a systemic approach: an issue that appears deep rooted, so that the problem returns even despite attempts to fix them, produces persistent patterns of failure, connects to other issues across components and systems, and reflects fundamental values, purposes and organisational approaches in society. \u202f\u00a0\u00a0"
