Katie Gowers, BNG\u2019s metric policy lead at Defra, has put together some helpful flowcharts to guide land managers through the process, and to consider the different sale options."

When you\u2019ve identified a piece of land you\u2019d like to explore BNG opportunities on, check the land registry to see the registered title, and if that land has other constraints."

            "text": "Think about what habitats you want to create or enhance. They may agree to create or enhance certain habitats to sell the units to a specific development, or they may create habitats and sell the units to a developer later (known as habitat banking)."

            "text": "You should also think about your land within the wider landscape. Try to deliver joined up, complementary habitats where you can and find out what habitats your local area would benefit from. This will be set out in Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS), which are being produced across the country with the explicit intention of assisting better targeting of BNG and nature recovery activities more generally. You can find out which LNRS your land comes under here. Your local responsible authority will be managing landowner engagement and setting expectations for the area\u2019s LNRS. If an LNRS is not published for your land, ask your local planning authority (LPA) for a draft version, or for the strategy they are applying in the area until the LNRS is published."

This legal agreement must be either a planning obligation (section 106 agreement) with their local planning authority, or a conservation covenant agreement with a Responsible Body. Land managers will also need to agree a habitat management and monitoring plan that sets out how they intend to achieve the planned habitat enhancements. Confirmed Responsible Bodies, which are needed for land managers to enter a conservation covenant, will be published soon."

There will be a registration fee, the price will be confirmed in guidance. This will be a digital service in which land managers will supply information about their land and planned habitat enhancements. If you\u2019re applying on behalf of the legal landowner, or as a tenant, you\u2019ll need to provide evidence that you have the landowner\u2019s consent to register the land. Details will be provided in guidance. Once approved, information for biodiversity gain sites in the register will be publicly searchable."
