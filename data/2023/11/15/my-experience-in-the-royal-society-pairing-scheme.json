It immediately caught my attention. I knew that my new role would mean working more closely with researchers than before. Therefore, with the support from my manager, I put my application together, which was a really straightforward process.\u00a0"

First, there\u2019s the \u2018Week in Westminster\u2019, packed with workshops, shadowing, networking and even a tour of The Royal Society library. We spent some time in Parliament and attended a reception hosted by the Science and Technology Select Committee. It was well worth making the most of it because you get to meet many of the other researchers and make connections beyond your direct pairing."

Plus having a scientist with you is a great conversation starter and we even had a chance to meet Prof Sarah Sharples, DfT\u2019s Chief Scientific Advisor, by passing her in the open-plan office and introducing ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "My other highlight was my shadowing visit to Southampton, organised by Benjamin. I got to meet the team behind the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute, visit the National Oceanography Centre and hear about the latest research on maritime air quality. I observed a live shipping test in the towing tank and toured the impressive National Infrastructure Laboratories. Plus, I got to meet lots of scientists who helpfully explained their research, on everything from renewable energy to railway infrastructure \u2013 I've really come away with a renewed understanding (and appreciation!) of geotechnical engineering.\u00a0"

I found it really helpful to have the opportunity to start building a network of researchers that I can tap into in the future and get a better sense of what challenges researchers face in engaging with policymakers in government.\u00a0\u00a0"

Don\u2019t worry too much about being matched with someone that works in your area either \u2013 the team tries its best to align subject areas but understanding the world of academia cuts across any subject area and you might just find yourself having fascinating conversations about topics you never thought about before.\u00a0\u00a0"
