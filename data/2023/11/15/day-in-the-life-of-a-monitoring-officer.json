I also undertake fish population surveys - part of my role which I especially enjoy."

            "text": "One day I can be out taking bathing water samples on the northern beaches of Wessex, including Clevedon and Weston.\u00a0 The Severn estuary has the second highest tidal range in the world and there can be 15 metres difference between high and low tide! \u00a0Any samples must be taken within one hour of high tide, so accessing these sites is especially time-sensitive. \u00a0Once we\u2019ve taken all our samples, they\u2019re sent to the lab for analysis to test for bacteria, including Escherichia Coli\u00a0and Enterococci. These types of bacteria can come from a range of sources such as sewage, livestock, wildlife, as well as surface run-off.\u00a0 The use of pollution risk forecasts also gives us an indication of water quality, and once analysed, the sample findings are reported on the Swimfo database."

        {
            "text": "I also conduct water chemistry sampling and invertebrate kick samples as part of our regular monitoring programme. This involves wading in a river, agitating the bed (with your foot sometimes, hence the name!) and taking samples. Invertebrate kick samples are particularly important as they can give us a clear picture of water quality without the need for chemical sampling.\u00a0 This is because certain invertebrates can only survive in specific water types - for example mayfly nymphs are only found in highly oxygenated, unpolluted rivers or streams. All this data feeds into national programmes, such as the Water Framework Directive, and plays a vital role in determining the state of our waters."

            "text": "Another day I could be working as Officer in Charge on a fishing survey, which often involves talking to private landowners and fishing clubs in order to gain access. If you\u2019re one of these people who allow us access to your land, then thank you! \u00a0These surveys are essential as they give us an important insight into the health of our seas and rivers."

        {
            "text": "To carry out these surveys, we \u2018electrofish\u2019 a 100m stretch of river, using a small electrical current which temporarily draws the fish to the anode so that we can catch them very quickly and efficiently, minimising any stress.\u00a0 We then keep them in an aerated tank filled with water whilst we identify and measure each individual. This enables us to monitor the fish populations in a stretch of river.\u00a0 Measuring the fish determines the age of the individuals caught, showing us if there is healthy reproduction occurring in our rivers. All the data is uploaded onto our national fish database, with all data available on our Fish and Ecology Data Explorer."

Whilst this can be challenging at times, it is extremely rewarding to be able to play a part in keeping our waterways healthy and ensuring that the fish population in our rivers and waterways are thriving."
