These two teams collaborate to craft long-term strategies for Strategic Command. We're the people behind those big Defence documents like the Command Paper, plans, and strategies. We also brainstorm with academics and experts to come up with innovative ideas."

            "text": "Ellis: Well, it's a bit of a journey. I started my career in law, but soon realised that practising law wasn't my passion. Before joining the Defence world, I spent three years at the Ministry of Justice, and what fascinated me from the get-go was understanding how policy evolves and how ideas transform into legislation. So when I was looking for a fresh start in a different department, I stumbled upon Strategic Command. It's this incredible melting pot covering everything from Defence Medical to Support & Logistics to Intelligence. It felt like an amazing opportunity to dive into areas I didn't even know existed."

            "text": "Ellis: Strategic Command is a bit of a chameleon; it's been called many things - the glue that binds Defence together, the crown jewel of Defence. And honestly, it's because we wear many hats and perform critical functions. We're the backbone of Defence, with all these essential components coming together under one roof."
