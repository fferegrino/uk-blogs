SONAC, and its challenge function is part of the Defence Secretary\u2019s plans for reform, laid out in the 2021 Defence Command Paper, which reinforces the commitment to modernise defence and address new and emerging threats across the globe. The 2016 Chilcot Report recognised a need to build challenge, critical thinking and diversity of thought into decision making, in order to safeguard against groupthink."

            "text": "Wargaming and red teaming are discrete exercises that aid decision making by using structured simulations; they apply specific rules, data, methods and procedures to explore serious subjects. Participants challenge decision making and explore the consequences of a complex chain of events; they stress test plans, explore alternative points of view, identify flaws in logic, uncover hidden biases and challenge assumptions. It\u2019s not just used by the military; public and private sector organisations use it around the world to understand complex problems from health education to cybersecurity."

SONAC has co-funded a challenge training pack with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and hosts quarterly sessions with other departments involved in challenge, to share expertise and best practice. They recently ran a public consultation exercise to shape the next Defence Command Paper, an achievement that was recognised within the Department, and are launching a Challenge Speakers Series in November, to bring external thinkers and experts into the department to further build on their culture of challenge."

Further strengthening of MoD\u2019s capabilities and sharing those skills across government are a key part of our vision for A Modern Civil Service, one that is skilled, innovative and ambitious in providing high quality advice to the Government, outstanding services to the public and safeguarding the UK\u2019s prosperity and security at home and overseas."
