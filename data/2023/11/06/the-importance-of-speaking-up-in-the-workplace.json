It\u2019s important colleagues feel listened to and their feedback acted on. Following-up closes the loop and makes sure we demonstrate positive change, learning and improvement as an organisation. Ultimately this will help us all to deliver better care, share knowledge to identify best practice and review guidance where necessary."

Leaders who do not listen will eventually be surrounded by staff who have nothing to say. A valued, motivated and committed team will improve care outcomes, so listening is at the very core of better service delivery and improving the lives of those we care for."
