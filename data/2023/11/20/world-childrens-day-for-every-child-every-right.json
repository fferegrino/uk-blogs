This initiative will provide educators with the resources, support and guidance needed to put nature at the heart of education. Embedding nature across everyday teaching and learning will give every child and young person in England the opportunity to develop a meaningful connection to nature, contribute to nature recovery across the country and build resilience for a changing world. This is even more important in a changing climate: healthy natural systems help us to reduce and adapt to climate change and understanding our place in the world matters more than ever."

Green spaces at school, provide a vital place where children can learn about and develop a relationship with the natural world, and reap the essential mental health and wellbeing benefits from time spent in nature."
