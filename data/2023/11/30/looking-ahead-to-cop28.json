            "text": "As we look ahead to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) starting this week in Dubai, it\u2019s worth reflecting on how climate and nature are inextricably linked. Much of our work at Natural England is done at the local or national level, but we work within a wider global context."

            "text": "We see the impacts of climate change affecting where different species can survive and thrive, how habitats are changing and rising sea levels re-shaping our coastline.\u00a0 We are using science to understand these changes and then adapting our work to get the best outcomes for nature and people. We are also working to restore high carbon ecosystems such as peatlands, woodlands and saltmarsh, to help stop greenhouse gases getting into the atmosphere and re-start the uptake of carbon. We have established adaptation plans for our National Nature Reserves and are considering how we ensure SSSIs can best support thriving nature under climate change."

We\u2019re leading the Nature Returns programme (Nature Returns - Natural England (blog.gov.uk), working with partners as a major contribution to this."

Having been to the last two climate change COPs, as part of my work with the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, (COP27 \u2013 a personal perspective - Natural England (blog.gov.uk) I\u2019ll be following developments from a distance this year."

            "text": "All UN Conventions have regular meetings known as \u2018Conferences of the Parties\u2019 or COPs, where countries who have signed the convention come to together to review and progress action. However, the COPs of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have achieved a degree of profile that no others have, with many world leaders attending as well as national negotiators \u2013 the core participants. There are also thousands of representatives of businesses and civil society who attend as \u2018observers\u2019 although in practice a whole series of parallel events takes place alongside, but separate from, the actual negotiations."

            "text": "So what can we expect this time? The key element of this year\u2019s COP is the completion of the \u2018Global Stocktake\u2019. This is a requirement of the Paris Agreement and requires a thorough assessment of progress towards meeting the objectives of the Agreement, including keeping global temperature rise to \u2018well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C\u2019."

        {
            "text": "The blunt truth is that the nations of the world are not on track to hold global warming to 1.5\u00b0C or close to it. There are debates about whether this is even possible now; it will certainly require a considerable acceleration of progress with reducing emissions and carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere in some form (including through natural solutions such as forest restoration)."

        {
            "text": "From an ecological perspective it really matters that global temperature rise is kept as low as possible. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, including extinctions of species and it is also critical to ensuring that natural ecosystems go on taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\u00a0 Every fraction of a degree matters."

        {
            "text": "Fossil fuel burning remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Making progress in rapidly reducing this is a key issue at COP which will be contentious.\u00a0 On the other hand, there is more conspicuous support for increasing the deployment of renewables with China and USA agreeing to support a trebling of global capacity by 2030."

            "text": "The role of nature is being recognised with the UAE presidency designating the theme for 9 December as Nature, Land Use, and Oceans. Our own, Tony Juniper, chair of the Natural England board will be going this year to take part. The critical role of forests in the global carbon cycling has long been recognised but last year\u2019s COP formally recognised the role of \u2018Nature-based Solutions\u2019 in its cover decision for the first time. This broader context is a positive development for linking the climate change and nature agendas."

This is a key element in both reducing emissions and building the resilience of the world\u2019s ecosystems. The challenge is to turn that policy into practice."
