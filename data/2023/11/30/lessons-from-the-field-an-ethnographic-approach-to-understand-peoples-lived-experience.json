            "text": "In May this year we were tasked with understanding how government farming advisers could encourage farmers and land managers to aim for more ambitious environmental outcomes when applying for funding from the Countryside Stewardship scheme. With our backgrounds in social research (Dan) and policy design (Becky), we decided to include an ethnographic element in our research. This method would allow us to learn things about our participants which might not be strictly within our scope (in this case Countryside Stewardship), but from experience we knew these kinds of insights could prove fundamental in understanding our research question and the policy area more deeply. And from a user-centred perspective, these kinds of insights are critical to make sure we are designing the right thing for people.\u00a0"

This allowed us to observe in real time how they went about advising farmers and land managers, hearing about issues that came up, and observing their interactions more generally. We followed our shadowing visits with online interviews and journey mapping, so that we could also ask specific questions regarding their role and experience advising on Defra\u2019s Countryside Stewardship scheme."

Our shadowing approach allowed us to both observe advisers\u2019 interactions with farmers and also be part of the farm visit itself. This included the possibility of asking some questions and experiencing other aspects of the adviser\u2019s day, including travelling between rural sites and their lunch break time.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "Ethnographic research can be recorded in a range of ways, including writing up field notes, keeping ethnographic diaries, capturing photographs and videos, as well as collecting any artefacts that provide insight into participants\u2019 lived experience. These activities tend to be led by the researcher, but can also be led by the participant. For example, asking participants to keep a video diary using their mobile phone. In this instance, we asked permission to take photos during our visits. We were keen to include this visual element in our research to give a richer, more compelling level of context that can inspire more empathy when sharing findings with people who weren\u2019t part of the research."
