            "text": "The Arabian / Persian Gulf is the world\u2019s hottest sea, and it is becoming hotter due to climate change. Its waters are experiencing increasing temperatures and salinity, rising sea level and decreasing oxygen levels. In Kuwait in 2020, sea temperatures reached a record breaking 37.6 \u00b0C. Home to a wide range of biodiversity including corals, turtles, dugong (sea cows), dolphins and sharks, this warming threatens the region\u2019s biodiversity and coastal communities. Marine biodiversity in the Gulf is particularly vulnerable to climate change as unlike in other parts of the world, there are\u00a0no species pre-adapted to warmer conditions\u00a0that can move in from warmer waters as it becomes too hot for the species that traditionally live there."

This year will include the first ever \u2018Global Stocktake\u2019, where countries assess their combined commitments and progress towards meeting the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement to limit global temperatures well below 2oC and ideally below 1.5oC. This includes identifying where there are still gaps or shortfalls against these goals, and agreeing additional, collective action to address these. This year\u2019s conference will also focus on delivering more finance from wealthier countries to help those most vulnerable to adapt to the impacts of climate change."

This will cause multiple impacts including further losses of coral reefs, declines in fish stocks, and will threaten coastal industries like desalination plants, due to damage caused by sea level rises and increased storms and cyclones."
