And I certainly did not expect that 3 months into the job I would be accompanying the GCSA to Japan and the Republic of Korea!\u00a0\u00a0"

This role allows me to be part of some fascinating conversations, ranging from the Council for Science and Technology to the regular updates with the other 20 Chief Scientific Advisers in government departments.\u00a0\u00a0"

This included drafting the original programme, commissioning policy colleagues for detailed briefings, and a last-minute run to Fortnum & Mason for diplomatic gifts!"

            "text": "Once the trip has begun, my job transitions into ensuring the whole thing runs smoothly. I would have a detailed itinerary of exactly where to be at what time, and keeping to this usually involves a few angry background calls to taxis and a subtle cough to colleagues that are talking for too long\u2026. Another critical role is ensuring that the GCSA and all her belongings, including her work laptop, folders and briefs make it from point A to point B."

            "text": "For me, the best part of this job will always be the amazing science I come across, such as on our visit to the Fugaku Supercomputer, the world\u2019s second-fastest computer. We met with many Japanese and Korean ministry representatives, chatted to well-known scientists, such as Sir Paul Nurse, at receptions, had dinner with Korean AI experts and attended a conference where scientific advisers from across the globe were gathered. We discussed everything from AI to semiconductors, engineering biology to increasing the number of women in STEM."

Understanding these technical conversations can be a challenge but always an excellent learning opportunity! The whirlwind 10-day diplomatic trip ended in a truly British fashion, having a pint with the GCSA and Ambassador, one of the many fun memories I took home with me.\u00a0\u00a0"
