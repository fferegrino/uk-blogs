As a minimum, an organisation should be able to meet the framework\u2019s \u2018Good\u2019 criteria. For example, in reference to technology management as a practice, a minimum (\u2018Good\u2019) standard for organisations is to ensure that technology is available to be reused and shared across government organisations and functions. However, the highest performing organisations will also ensure that they are contributors to open source repositories and publish the majority of their code openly and publicly where possible."
