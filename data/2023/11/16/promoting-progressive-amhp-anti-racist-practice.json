It\u2019s important I present my authentic self to effect change rather than working from a position of blame, which only reinforces hostile work environments. We\u2019re all human, it\u2019s OK to be scared and to give yourself permission to be vulnerable."

There have, without a doubt, been some examples of good practice. However, the hardest part has been challenging practices (inequalities, disparities, gaslighting and coercion to name a few) within services."

For example, during a BAME carers meeting (I don\u2019t even like the term BAME), a trainer gave a brief overview of PCREF. It was going well. They explained all staff would be given cultural, statutory and regulatory awareness training."

They responded by saying it was a great idea, which they would take back to their organisation to consider. This seemed fair enough, as they were not in a position to make any decisions there and then."

            "text": "I was left feeling this was a prime example of my lived experience of power and control. They were describing the framework from their professional perspective and trying to tell us, the patient and carer, how we should use it. That\u2019s not equity, co-production, or partnership working. My request is simple: we must work it out together, sharing learning and understanding."

How can we \u2018fix\u2019 people in a broken system, one which suffers from institutional racism? We need to consider conscious and unconscious bias in professionals, challenging racism in practice. For practice to be truly progressive and based on human rights, this includes reporting and logging incidents of racism."

It\u2019s essential to ask someone in crisis about their lived experiences. Having a mental health issue is a journey in a difficult and racist world. If external factors make the person sick, then racism can seem like an illness and have lasting effects. The culture around mental health must change for us all to be well."
