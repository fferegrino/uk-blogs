Being able to ask myself what is expected on-site to minimise and mitigate impacts on the environment and any concerns from the public. Compliance Assessment Reports (CAR) and Waste Assessment Reports (WAR) are the basis of assessing sites, in which I have developed a good competency from the practical experience and training."

            "text": "Garages can be harmful to the environment, and often in indirect ways that you wouldn\u2019t think could be so detrimental. For example, there are many contamination risks just from the incorrect disposal of oil rags. By simply throwing them in the bin you are actually mixing a hazardous waste with general waste, and without interceptors or bunded areas, any oil on the rags can leak into drainage. Proper disposal and having spill kits readily available on-site is essential."

The training opportunities, site visits, enrichment activities and the team itself made this internship a great chance to gain a practical understanding of working within the Regulated Industry.
