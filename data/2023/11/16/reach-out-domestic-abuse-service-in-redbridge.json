The name \u2018Spotlight\u2019 was chosen for the programme because individuals are supported, first and foremost, to shine a light on their  behaviours and take accountability for their abuse. The Spotlight Programme  then works with individuals to help them identify and address the underlying  belief systems that drive such behaviours and equips them with the tools to  create change.\u00a0\u00a0"

Initially I was sceptical about taking a major decision as I was completely clueless about how to move forward in a new country. With the prompt and professional support provided by the DV Hub, I was all set to come out of the unhealthy relationship. Me and my daughter are extremely thankful for the commendable service provided. This is exactly the kind of support that every woman who is a victim of DV needs to be offered for them to be able to move forward in confidence.\u201d\u00a0"
