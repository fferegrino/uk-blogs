            "text": "Persistent school absence is one of the most significant ongoing impacts of the pandemic. The latest data shows that nearly 1 in 4 pupils were absent for 10% of school sessions in autumn 2022, nearly double the position in 2019. We remain very concerned about the effect this will have on children."

            "text": "As the Department for Education (DfE) points out in its blog Why is school attendance so important and what are the risks of missing a day?, we know that the highest attendance rates are linked with the best outcomes at all key stages. Even missing small amounts of education can mean a child misses important sections of the curriculum and may therefore struggle to learn concepts that are built on what they missed."

Learning with peers, enjoying sport and music, building relationships with adults beyond their families, and building friendships \u2013 these are the building blocks of well-being and a good life. School contributes so much to this."

        {
            "text": "But many factors are within schools\u2019 powers, and it is right to expect them to do all they reasonably can to achieve the highest possible attendance. If a school can demonstrate they are doing this, we will judge it favourably, even if its attendance numbers are lower than previously. Importantly, the school will need to demonstrate they are moving towards pre-pandemic levels of attendance or higher, even if they remain a distance away from their overall ambition. However, if a school is not doing all that can reasonably be expected, we may still have concerns."

While a degree of caution may be appropriate in some cases, as the Chief Medical Officer set out in his letter to school leaders on mild illness and school attendance:"
