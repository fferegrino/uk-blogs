It is also the first time APHA has organised an exhibition stand to unite animal and plant health public engagement messages on biosecurity. Over 23,000 people attended the show, and we were pleased to talk to around 1500 on our stand over the weekend, with 700 on the \u2018Schools Day\u2019 alone!"

            "text": "The first display introduced some of the common plant pests, animal pathogens and vectors that can be detrimental to plants, animals and bees. Lucy Carson Taylor, who has been leading the plant health public engagement work for a number of years, provided some great models of a Colorado potato beetle, oak processionary moths, an Asian hornet and Asian longhorn beetle. We did not have many models from the animal health side which meant sourcing some animal pathogen models over the summer! We commissioned a colourful new avian influenza (bird flu) virus model and purchased a range of fluffy bacteria and mosquitoes, which allowed us to discuss how animal and plants can become unwell."

            "text": "We also borrowed a huge E. coli model from the University of Salford following a call for assistance through the Royal Society of Biology outreach group and the Microbiology Society. We were excited when Professor Chloe James offered to loan us two E. coli models that she uses at events to demonstrate how bacteriophages work. Two university students with an interest in public engagement of science from Chloe\u2019s network also volunteered to join us to talk about bacteria and other pathogens and pests. This was a great team effort to share outreach resources and knowledge."

This highlighted the importance for farmers to keep the tyres of vehicles entering or leaving their farm clean."

One wore clothes showing how countryside walkers could spread disease and pests on their clothes and footwear and another wore a disposable boiler suit, helmet and wellington boots showing how scientists protect themselves from disease. A boot disinfecting pad gave the children a fun thing to trample through to reiterate the need to clean your footwear."

Everyone said how good it was to talk to so many people about our work and ways they could help us to protect animal and plant health, conveying how this can also affect people, food and the environment. The show was quite expensive to attend, but we were pleased to provide free tickets for some disadvantaged students from three schools close to our science headquarters in Surrey."

If anyone pledged 2 or 3, they were given a card with details of helpline numbers or a luggage tag as reminders. The results showed they were willing to consider taking action to help improve biosecurity and the children all walked away with a \u2018I am a biosecurity champion\u2019 sticker, which we hope encourages them to remember this in their daily lives. We also hope to have inspired some to consider careers in science and possibly at APHA sites around the country."
