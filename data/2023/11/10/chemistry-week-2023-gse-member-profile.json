            "text": "I think because chemistry plays a fundamental role in everyone\u2019s life and affects us in every way possible, I was drawn to it. I knew I wanted my career to make a valuable contribution to society, and the world will always need chemists to help improve the way we live. I liked the fact that by going into chemistry, there was such a diverse range of possible career opportunities, so I wasn\u2019t closing any doors (which was important as I had no idea what I wanted to do)."

            "text": "My favourite part of the Science and Engineering Fast Stream is being able to try 4 different jobs across 3 years. This is a great way of seeing different career options available to a scientist in government and allows you to develop many skills, some of which I definitely wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to develop without the role.

            "text": "Communication is one of the most useful skills I developed while studying chemistry and I use communication the most in my career. My degree developed my problem-solving skills as well as my analytical skills, which have both been extremely valuable in my career so far, particularly when using evidence to inform decision-making across government. Teamwork is also an essential skill for my career, which my chemistry background provided through collaborative laboratory projects I took part in."
