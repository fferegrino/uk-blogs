I have previously worked in the power generation, transmission and distribution department of my state back in India. Even though my professional route isn\u2019t the field of environmental conservation, I have always aimed to make sure my work is sustainable. We tend to take care of the things we appreciate more, and I am someone who appreciates nature."
