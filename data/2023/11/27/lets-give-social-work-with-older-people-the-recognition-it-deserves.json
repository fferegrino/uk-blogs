For every referral into adult services there are five times fewer social workers than for children\u2019s services. And, although many services have specialist teams for adults with learning disabilities or mental health problems, there are fewer dedicated teams for older people."

For some reason, probably to do with the incredible life stories of my Nan, and my English, Polish and Irish great aunts, I was drawn to working with people in later life."

We have produced a policy briefing and will be holding a webinar for Principal Social Workers and other leaders to talk through the implications for deploying and supporting social workers."
