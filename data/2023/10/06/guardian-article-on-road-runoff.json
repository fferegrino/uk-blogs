They are not directly regulated by the Environment Agency but they do work with the government and partner organisations to reduce pollution from roads. Responsibility for these outfalls rests with National Highways and local authorities."

In addition, highways owners like National Highways and Local Authorities have no control over what comes off the roads from vehicles themselves."

Instead, the Environment Agency takes a collaborative approach and works with National Highways on the delivery of the current and future Road Investment Strategy\u2019s to minimise environmental impact, including putting in treatment at higher risk outfalls."
