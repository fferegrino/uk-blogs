We know, from exciting initiatives across government, this kind of change is possible. For example, the Home Office is moving to Product Lifecycle Management, working collaboratively across policy, operations and digital to deliver continuous improvements to products and services. Two programmes have transitioned to this approach so far, focusing on delivering outcomes rather than outputs and proving they\u2019re able to respond quickly to changes.\u00a0"
