You think \u2018what can I do beyond just living my life for myself?\u2019 So, the chance to make an impact motivates me."

It can be challenging, and of course, frustrating at times, however, I really do believe I\u2019m doing something worthwhile. I think you would struggle to meet a nicer bunch of people than those working in probation. They are a really excellent, experienced team who go out of their way to help. And I can see the impact that they make on \u00a0lives, and that\u2019s very inspiring."

And I think everybody plays a part in that. For instance, those at the front of house (reception) in our offices \u2013 they\u2019re fantastic. Sometimes they have offenders, who may be anxious or agitated, come in and give them a hard time. So it\u2019s not always an easy job but the team here are always so helpful and handle everything so professionally. Without them we couldn\u2019t do what we do every day."
