Accompanied by the T\u00e1naiste, Miche\u00e1l Martin TD (Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland) and Vaughan Gething MS, Minister for the Economy, the event marked the culmination of more than ten years work and a significant milestone for the project and the tidal energy sector in Wales."

Morlais will benefit local communities, the economy and climate by generating clean low carbon electricity using tidal power. The project is phased to protect wildlife and habitats and will be developed gradually to a potential maximum generating capacity of 240MW, creating between 100 and 200 jobs in the process. Profits from the scheme will be reinvested by Menter M\u00f4n into other regeneration projects."

There are no silver bullets, but the difference our approach can make is remarkable and the Morlais success demonstrates this."

The NDA didn\u2019t identify or create the project, but by working with local partners we have enabled good ideas to take flight, grow and become reality. As an enabling organisation, we will continue to use our resources to leverage significantly more money than we are able to provide directly, supporting our communities in the creation and realisation of their ambitions."
