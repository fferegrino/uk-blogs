            "text": "There are three things I have learnt about diversity and inclusion recently: The first is I never realised how much representation can make a meaningful difference. Last year, I was lucky enough to attend Cancer Research\u2019s sponsored Black in Cancer event, which was both informative and empowering. After Black in Cancer, I contributed to Cancer Research\u2019s patient involvement newsletter and co-founded the organisation Black and Brown in Bioethics (BBB), with Kumeri Bandara and Harleen Kaur Johal."

        {
            "text": "The second is we can all make small incremental steps that provoke change over time. BBB aims to achieve racial equity within the UK bioethics community. Within the first year of launching BBB, we have organised a series of webinars with academics and industry professionals, received funding from the Institute of Medical Ethics for a qualitative study into the experiences of postgraduates in different racial groups, organised a limited podcast series exploring Power and Privilege in Academia, and won the EACME Paul Schotsmans award for our project Inclusive bioethics: modifying methodology to transform research."
        },
        {
            "text": "The third, and I feel one of the most important things is understanding the importance of lived experience and participatory research. I previously worked in the clinical trials industry where there were debates around patient-centricity being a buzzword or a paradigm shift.\u00a0I currently sit on the Bristol Cancer Research Network steering committee and on the Board of Trustees at the Brain Tumour Charity, which has helped me really understand the value of authentic lived experience. I acknowledge there are still obstacles and I feel we can ensure that more people from different life journeys have input in science advice, strategies and policies at all levels to help us not just imagine but achieve a more positive future for future generations."

        {
            "text": "How this learning connects with my role: Before joining the Futures team, I would tend to catastrophise the future, but I have found future thinking is not about dystopias and utopias but understanding long-term issues or challenges shaping future development in policy. There are many future possibilities that can happen, but we can also influence things based on what we do today."
