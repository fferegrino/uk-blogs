In the face of climate change and the UK being the second largest net importer of timber in the world, behind China, there is an urgent need to increase and improve the flow of these benefits for the advantage of society, the environment, and the economy."

This development saves woodland owners and managers time, a key barrier to woodland management."

The inventory tool seeks to combine classic woodland management data and techniques with an intuitive interface. This allows woodland owners to build woodland inventories and improve their knowledge of their woodlands and build confidence to make decisions quickly and accurately."

These experts are supporting those seeking to develop solutions to management barriers. For example, forward thinking individuals and organisations are looking to develop their business offerings and purchase new equipment to undertake a wider range of forestry services, particularly in smaller woodlands. Northwoods are supporting them to understand different financing options."

            "text": "Other examples of innovators supported by the Northwoods Programme are those looking to develop markets and improve the economics of woodland management to enable woodland owners to undertake management activities from management plans, biodiversity surveys, and physical operations. The avenues being investigated are looking to provide markets to diseased material, sourcing local residues to replace imported materials, offering leisure and recreation facilities, and adding value to brash products. Improving funding options for management activities helps to improve the quality of active management. Grant funding often helps owners on the first steps of their woodland management journey, but income derived from woodland management helps to justify time spent on applying to grants and appointing services."
