To do so effectively, these missions need to be set out transparently in advance, calibrated in a way that balances ambition and feasibility. They need to be evaluated rigorously to ensure policy actions and final outcomes are on the critical path towards meeting the missions.\u00a0\u00a0"

The thinking behind the choice of these missions, and their calibration, was set out clearly in the LUWP. These missions are now being put into UK primary legislation through the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill. This is currently working its way through Parliament, with Royal Assent likely in the third quarter of 2023.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "This Bill requires the Government to issue a statement of levelling up missions and to update this at least once every five years, openly and transparently. This will mean the missions themselves are subject to regular Parliamentary and public scrutiny. The Bill also requires annual reporting by the Government on progress towards meeting these missions, with this reporting to start no later than a year after Royal Assent.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "As long-term objectives, meeting the missions will take time. So key aspect of this accountability will be determining a set of intermediate metrics to track and assess progress towards meeting the missions. The LUWP set out a provisional set of monitoring metrics and it is likely that the first published annual report on meeting the missions will elaborate on them.\u00a0"

It would provide clarity, long-termism and greater robustness in policy through enhanced transparency and scrutiny. The missions themselves would require Parliamentary approval before being significantly altered or abandoned.\u00a0"

            "text": "As this statutory framework is not yet in place, it is too early to know how in practice it will operate. How rigorous will be the scrutiny of the missions? How objective will be the reporting on progress relative to the missions? These will be the acid tests of the credibility of the new framework. So far, external evaluations suggest progress towards meeting the missions has been modest."

Elsewhere, the Government has ensured that additional investment is growing emerging clusters outside the Greater South East - for example the launch of three Innovation Accelerators in Glasgow, Manchester and the West Midlands. This supports the growth of high-potential innovation clusters with \u00a3100 million invested in 26 projects across the three areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

A significant element was the move to a single department-style funding settlement at the next Spending Review. This will not only simplify the funding landscape for these regions, but will also increase the West Midlands Combined Authority and Greater Manchester Combined Authority\u2019s autonomy, ability to prioritise decisions locally, and ability to reprioritise across their own budgets.\u00a0\u00a0"

The intention is to consult with the Devolved Administrations to explore potential options in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Partnership locations were selected based on analysis in the Levelling Up White Paper and metrics of levelling up need. Partnerships will include local leaders and mayors in councils and combined authorities, local businesses from all sectors, community organisations and residents coming together to identify and address the biggest barriers to levelling up.\u00a0"

On data, the Office for National Statistics have progressed significantly their sub-national data strategy.\u00a0 One example of this is public-funded research and development (R&D) expenditure, where the ONS led an exercise with the three central government departments with the highest expenditure to compile financial microdata. The output was a new dataset that revealed the distribution of public R&D expenditure sub-nationally, allowing government to monitor progress on the Levelling Up mission to increase public R&D expenditure outside the Greater South East. In parallel, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) have put in place a spatial data unit to inform decision-making on local issues.\u00a0\u00a0"
