From experiencing heatwaves first-hand here in the UK, to hearing about drinking-water wells drying up due to drought in my parents\u2019 villages in Sri Lanka, witnessing the negative impacts of climate change across the world is what initially pushed me to pursue a career in this field."

Although I had the relevant knowledge from my masters, I didn\u2019t have any relevant work experience. Through the Summer Diversity Internship Programme (SDIP) here at the Environment Agency (EA), I\u2019ve been able to get this experience and so much more. Everyone I\u2019ve worked with has been welcoming and continuously encouraged me to provide my thoughts and challenge ideas."

The training also gave me a great summary of climate change policies, causes, and impacts. Leading a discussion (a vital part of the training) with other EA employees helped me understand their thoughts on climate change too and we all learned to really think about and share how we can reduce our carbon footprints - from how we get to and from work, to saving energy at home."

I became a Volunteer Climate Officer with the Collective for Climate Action, which helped me develop my skillset further, network, and learn more about climate change in practice."

I hope to broaden my network, continue to work with stakeholders, and gain new experiences in the climate sector. After my internship concludes next year, I want to stay on as a permanent employee here at the EA or continue to work in the public sector as a Civil Servant."

            "text": "One of the major lessons I learned from the people I worked with here at the EA is that with climate change, you should never give up, and no action to reduce our contributions to climate change is too small. Whether you support climate education in your workplace, volunteer for a climate organisation, reduce the food you waste, use reusable products, reduce car travel, write to your local MP, or plant trees, I encourage you to do what you can to help our planet."
