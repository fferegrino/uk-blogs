In private beta, representatives from around 50 local authorities will be able to interact with and test the online tool as it is being built. Our private beta participants can offer feedback on how straightforward the tool is to use, and whether they encounter any 'bugs' (issues with the online tool). This helps us to fix issues and improve the service as we build, meaning that the service is constantly improving. We're aiming to release private beta in spring 2024."
