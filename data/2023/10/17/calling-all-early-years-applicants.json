If you are not available, we will follow up via email with questions about your application and it is important that you respond quickly."

In this case, the organisation linked to the hospital is accountable for the registration of the daycare. The most senior person in the organisation with direct responsibility for childcare in the hospital must apply, but no other directors or committee members need to be listed on a registration."
