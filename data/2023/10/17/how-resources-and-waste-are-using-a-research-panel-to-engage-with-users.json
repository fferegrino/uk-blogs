And my colleague Will wrote more recently about how being customer-centric is helping us to design the new service for packaging producers."

So they were contributing, but not seeing the results of that. And we get that, it\u2019s hard to see change, especially with such long-term objectives and timelines that keep shifting; being on a user research panel is frustrating if you can\u2019t see what your work is contributing to."

It doesn\u2019t need to be a big update, but it\u2019s worth letting people know what user research is, what the panel does and what people have signed up to. It\u2019s also a social proofing exercise so you feel like part of something bigger about changes in resources and waste."

Small producers, packaging importers and skip companies are all seldom heard from, and we know where we can find some of these participants, but using this community also supports with developing those lesser-known areas."
