In the vast majority of cases, you do not need to worry about this.

The sale is legal, the new owner can move in, and the property is theirs. Their legal rights are protected in the Land Register the moment we receive the new application, not from the day we actually register it which will be some time later because the sale needs to happen first.\u00a0"
