We were well into wedding planning when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and everything was put on pause. This opened the opportunity to allow us to discuss our future even more and we kept talking about a child. At the time, we both had concerns and doubts."

            "text": "After lots of talking we decided it was the right time and started by researching adoption stories, advice and information about the process. We spoke to some adoption agencies, friends, family and our local authority. We decided to fill in a brief introductory form with Rotherham One Adoption Agency to start our journey."

            "text": "Around 2 weeks later we heard back from Rotherham who then arranged an initial meeting with our social worker. In this introduction we started to form our working relationship and got to know each other better. The strong level of trust needed between the social worker and ourselves was something we weren\u2019t prepared for. In truth, the process can be a hard slog, so having a trusted social worker who can guide you throughout the process is so important. Essentially, your social worker should be someone you would trust to understand all your personal details and eventually set you up with the right child. Also, particularly as a LGBT+ couple you want someone with an understanding of same sex couples and holds no preconceived ideas. If you\u2019re not comfortable with your current social worker, you can ask to change. You will not be judged for doing this and it will help you in the long term."

In our case, the first panel meeting which determined whether we were the right people to adopt, happened at the mid-point of the process. Our second and final panel meeting happened once we had met our child, to review the match."

For some this takes time which is no judgement on you, it\u2019s much more about creating the right match. We were introduced to Aspen, a 16-month-old baby girl with beautiful blonde hair and gorgeous blue eyes. I can tell you now, at that moment it was sealed."

We were worried their expectations would be too much and Aspen may have too much family. We got to meet them, and we started a bond straight away. We\u2019ve developed a friendship and embraced new in-laws. We are so lucky they are in Aspen\u2019s life as they will help her identity as she grows and starts to have questions."

The worry about homophobia and people treating her differently because she has 2 dads has yet to appear and Aspen has become a confident toddler. We constantly get compliments about how brilliant she is from teachers, friends and family and anyone who gets to meet her. She really has given us, her Daddy and Pops, meaning to our lives and eternal happiness."

Your journey will have highs and lows, but your family is worth it. Get the right support behind you and make it your goal. You can do this, you\u2019re not alone."
