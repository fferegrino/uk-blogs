I only had to wait approximately four weeks for an online appointment and clear instructions were emailed to me of how to join. The 45min appointment was thorough, all the points I had raised were discussed in full. I now wish I\u2019d been offered this opportunity years ago when I first started the menopause transition when I was 46 years old. The menopause specialist had a plan and realised that I had been plodding along for the last four years and made some tweaks to my already prescribed medication. You also get a 15 min review 12 weeks after your initial appointment.\u00a0My advice would be, don\u2019t hesitate to book up and get\u00a0 reassurance from an experienced specialist. They really do put your mind at rest and help you make an informed decision for your journey during the menopause and after.\u201d"

We are keen to encourage anyone, whatever gender or age, to talk about menopause as it affects all our lives, whether at home or work.\u00a0We will continue with these caf\u00e9s to enable conversations to overcome the taboo of talking about menopause and make it normal.\u201d"

The group are always on hand with advice or something new to try and all with the grace of fabulous humour, which is very much appreciated. Knowing you can share your thoughts in an open group without judgement is the most powerful thing about 'our' group, and I would hate to be without it now!\u201d"

It\u2019s so good to raise awareness that many of our people are feeling the impact of menopause and now have a platform to discuss any issues or concerns openly \u00a0Just to get the topic of menopause out in the open has been very enlightening for all and very encouraging.\u201d"
