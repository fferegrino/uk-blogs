I had visited a young offenders Institution before, as part of a previous role, but never a Prison.\u00a0 Several things struck me as important as I looked around the training facilities and spoke with Prisoners that day, one of which was the clear commitment of Prison staff to the training and education of the men in their care (and it was all men in this prison) from day one of their time at HMP Standford Hill."

            "text": "Another was a reminder of the value of this kind of outreach and the brilliant engagement of the men we met who wanted to hear about what the civil service might offer as an employer as they start to consider their next steps after release. But more than anything it reinforced my existing view that the civil service as a large national employer must have a role to play in providing roles for prison leavers and we cannot be complacent about expecting people to understand the civil service, all it does and all it can offer as an employer - we need to go out and tell people who we are and why the civil service is a great place to work."
