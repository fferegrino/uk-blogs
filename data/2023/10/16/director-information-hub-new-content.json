            "text": "In July, the Insolvency Service launched our new director information hub on GOV.UK giving directors of companies clear, bitesize information to guide them through the lifecycle of their company. We are pleased to announce the launch of additional content, which includes topics such as, Directors Loan Accounts, Directors Duties Upon Insolvency, Compulsory Liquidation, Mental Health and many more. It also includes three new animation videos that bring the guidance to life with real-life scenarios. The hub, which was announced at Insolvency Live! by Kevin\u202fHollinrake, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department for Business and Trade, is a great tool for all company directors - whether they\u2019re setting up a small company for the first time or have been trading for many years.The Hub will be continually updated in response to the feedback we receive from company directors and other stakeholders, including Companies House, HMRC, Institute for Turnaround, UK Finance and more. Our next release will give guidance on a number of tax-related topics and we are working with HMRC colleagues to develop the content.We will continue to support directors running a limited company by providing bitesize information, animations and signposting to reliable sources of further guidance and support.If you wish to provide feedback on the hub, or provide suggestions for future content topics, please do so by completing our user survey."
