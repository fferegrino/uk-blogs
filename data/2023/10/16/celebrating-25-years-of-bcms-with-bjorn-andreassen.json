            "text": "It\u2019s 25 years since the formation of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS), which is responsible for maintaining the central online database of all bovine animals in Great Britain. This is the Cattle Tracing System (CTS), which animal keepers use to report the births, deaths and movements of their bovine animals. In the fourth of our series of blogs talking to BCMS staff past and present, Bjorn Andreassen talks about his 23 years with BCMS. "

My primary responsibilities are to adapt to the demands of the department, meet the customer needs and assist management whenever needed in whatever role required."

            "text": "Every bovine animal in the\u00a0UK has a unique number, shown both on an\u00a0ear tag\u00a0in each ear and on a paper\u00a0cattle passport held by the animal\u2019s keeper. The number and passport remain with the animal throughout its life, and are recorded by the slaughterhouse at its death, allowing\u00a0traceability\u00a0of the\u00a0beef. The tracing system provided by BCMS works alongside the physical passport to record the births, deaths and movements of all cattle. Specifically, I\u2019m responsible for processing the passport applications following a cattle death, and I also action herd register and barcode label requests and oversee the general housekeeping of the department."

            "text": "I\u2019m proud to work for BCMS and feel that my role makes life easier for keepers by helping them to keep their cattle records up-to-date. One of the aspects of my role that I think has the greatest impact is when I help cattle keepers who aren\u2019t computer literate by actioning barcode label requests and sending out herd registers that they struggle to download."

            "text": "I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my 23 years with BCMS and we\u2019ve seen lots of changes in that time. I was very impressed with the way that management and staff alike adapted to working from home during the COVID lockdown era. Management went to great lengths to contact homeworkers to see how they were adapting to working from home - they were absolutely brilliant throughout in checking up on the health and wellbeing of all of us."

This forms part of the wider Livestock Information Transformation Programme, which will replace the existing traceability databases with one multi-species platform."

            "text": "These changes are exciting for BCMS and what excites me personally for the future is that it\u2019s unpredictable. There will always be new work to learn and new challenges to face. There will occasionally be new technology updated within the business and new processes of learning to adapt to."

Away from work, I enjoy browsing HMV for the latest releases, as well as looking for decent, inexpensive places to eat at. I particularly enjoy going to the cinema as I love films and also television \u2013 I could give you a list of my all-time favourites, but we\u2019d run out of room\u2026\u2026."
