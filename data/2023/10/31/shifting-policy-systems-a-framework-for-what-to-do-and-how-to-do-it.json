Over the last year, we have explored the latest in systems change theory and applied it to policymaking. In this four part blog series, we share our reflections on the wealth of knowledge we\u2019ve gained working on intractable issues surrounding how support is delivered for people experiencing multiple disadvantage. Along the way, we realised that we need to make new tools to support policy teams to do this deep work in the future, and to see afresh the limitations of existing mental models for change and transformation."

To approach this complex policy area, the programme partnered with Policy Lab, creating a multi-disciplinary team including ethnographers, designers and systems thinkers, which focussed on addressing the following challenge question: How can we ensure that central government enables flexible and person-centred frontline delivery models on an ongoing basis for people facing multiple disadvantage?"

We carried out film ethnography, involving 29 participants in three areas across England (Greater London, East Midlands and the Northeast).

Our methods were informed by frameworks from a global movement of systems change experts and future thinkers, calling for a creative re-imagining of current social infrastructures. This co-created future vision enabled the group to articulate future values and draw on the four keys: power, purpose, relationships and resource flows, to articulate what the future system should look and feel like."

In systems innovation, this is called moving from \u2018\u201csystem now\u201d to \u201csystem next\u201d, or the system as it is, to the system as it could be.\u2019 (Charles Leadbeater, Systems Innovation Initiative, 2023)."

It requires continuous observing, learning, investing-in and enabling of the things that are working. Work with people in your system to co-design a set of future values.

Build a coalition of changemakers, who are open, and hold some power to influence others and make change. Diverse and strong relationships are also crucial to the quality of ideas that emerge. Relationships with people across the system will keep you on course towards a shared goal and purpose. The importance of facilitation or convening this coalition of changemakers cannot be underestimated to maintain momentum. From the outset of the multiple disadvantage project, we launched a large cross-system group of experts, centring people with lived experience, to share their insights with us through five workshops involving 126 number of participants over nine months. We built close relationships with the National Expert Citizen Group (NECG) to understand a range of lived experiences and sought advice from sector experts through the Expert Stakeholder Group (ESG)."
