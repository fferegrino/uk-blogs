All the training is underpinned by a huge range of resources and research that new teachers might have struggled to access previously."

            "text": "The new 2-year induction programme is very research driven and really useful for ECTs. The increase in length of the induction programme is allowing ECTs to develop their skills further and I can see ECTs in our school becoming more \u00a0independent, and better prepared for the future."

            "text": "It\u2019s important that schools are clear about the induction tutor role so that it is not blurred or mixed in with the work of the mentor. It is not about coaching, mentoring or providing the on the ground support for ECTs, instead the induction tutor has oversight of ECTs progress and makes formal evaluations. The induction tutor should ideally be separate to the mentor to enable both roles to function effectively. This way, the ECT has someone to go to on a day to day basis as well as someone who\u2019s there to offer support and troubleshoot any wider issues. The induction tutor in our academy has made a massively positive impact and I\u2019ve been able to see a visible shift in confidence and personal growth for both mentors and ECTs."

For example, the first module on pupil learning, routines and behaviour systems is having a massive impact. This is so important in the first stages of teaching, and I have seen ECTs implementing their learning in the classrooms. They also share their learnings and success stories with their peers."

            "text": "ECT modules are well tailored to what ECTs need and follow on from prior learning. The initial audits are useful and allow ECTs to reflect on where they are as a practitioner. The audits also support both the ECT and mentor to decide how much time needs to be given to each area. A lot of our ECTs \u00a0already had strengths in fulfilling wider professional responsibilities so mentors spent more time focusing on weaker areas such as making productive use of assessments."
