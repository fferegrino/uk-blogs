It has become increasingly clear in recent years that if we are to deliver our target to halt, and then reverse, the decline of nature, it is not enough to protect only the best habitats and rarest species. We need to recreate habitats we have lost, too.\u00a0"

All 48 areas will need to follow requirements set out in the Environment Act and the LNRS regulations and guidance when preparing their strategies. Together these rules will make sure that each LNRS contains broadly the same things and follows a similar process in preparing the strategy, ensuring national consistency whilst reflecting the unique local circumstances of each area.\u00a0"
