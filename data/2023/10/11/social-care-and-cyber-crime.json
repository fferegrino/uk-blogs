That chain includes their own tech and IT suppliers, as well as the organisations and individuals who connect with those systems in any way. It includes the suppliers, managers and users of tech systems that providers access but don\u2019t manage directly \u2013 for example, electronic medication ordering systems that are managed by pharmacies and GP-led proxy access systems."

Cyber criminals are smart like that \u2013 they will exploit any open door, and once they are in, it\u2019s difficult to stop them. Having worked with many small and medium sized providers, their primary concerns are \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about this, I don\u2019t talk \u2018technical language\u2019 and I lack the confidence to even know where to start\u201d. But in reality, it can be as easy as having a conversation with your IT supplier and asking for their business continuity plans which should outline the steps they will take in the event of disruption to their service."

We\u2019re very aware that care providers are well used to \u2018thinking on their feet\u2019 and most, if not all, have continuity plans for situations such as staff and petrol shortages but many get nervous about planning for a cyber incident due to perceived lack of knowledge when in reality it is a relatively simple process that could save time and money in the event of a cyber incident."
