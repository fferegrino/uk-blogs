Its iconic, imposing Grade 1 listed site at St Pancras is a London landmark welcoming over 1.5 million visitors a year. But as well as being a national institution, it is also a local one - sitting squarely in the London Borough of Camden, surrounded by local communities and families. As such Camden (and Camden Libraries especially) has a unique relationship with the British Library."

These meetings are invaluable as they provide insight to what our national library is working on and helps me understand their challenges as a large organisation. It\u2019s interesting to compare the synergies of a local library services\u2019 struggles with changing the perception of what a modern public library service can offer with a national library."

Sally says: \u201cWorking with Camden Libraries on skills development is a great opportunity to learn from each other\u2019s experiences and share good practice as well as developing our knowledge and practical skills.

Camden Libraries have been invited to be on the strategic steering group for the new community engagement space which will launch in December at the British Library which is very exciting and will give us an opportunity to promote our offer in a new venue and join up with the British Library on promoting libraries as places of knowledge and idea sharing."
