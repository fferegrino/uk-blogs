The good news is that you don\u2019t need to wait until you start a new role to understand what it would be like. Digital teams are multi-disciplinary, which means we work alongside colleagues of different specialisms every day. If you\u2019re curious about another role in the team, try observing how that person behaves, what they do day-to-day, and how they tackle problems. You could also ask them directly about their path into digital, or request to shadow them for a day.\u00a0\u00a0"
