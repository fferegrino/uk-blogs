Relatives, friends and even local authorities make applications for property and affairs deputyships and the role of the court is to decide whether that will be in the best interests of the individual. Decisions made by the courts can have serious implications so applications are always considered carefully, and the court never loses sight of the fact that a real person will be impacted by the outcome."

By doing this, interested parties like doctors, relatives, social workers etc can provide comments which are submitted with the application. That helps the judge making the decision by giving them more information at the start of the application process, enabling them to make the right decision quickly."
