The DRACoE team works across Defra, looking at how automation can be used to make our lives easier (and in some cases, the lives of our users and customers too)."

To start with we had temporary pause points in the automation, to enable admin colleagues to check the robot was processing each step correctly. Then, once we were happy that things were running smoothly, we removed the pause points and the robot continued under low supervision."
