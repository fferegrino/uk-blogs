It's been really nice for my wife and especially for my two children, who've grown up overseas. This is their first time living in the UK. Now they can have more opportunity to visit Wales to see their grandparents as well as really appreciate the UK.\u202fWe're all enjoying that as a family. It's been a really good part of coming back and starting work in a very different environment.\u202f\u00a0"
