The Muslim community had put together a lump sum of money for this project in order to create an \u2018Islamic Garden\u2019 for the prison so during family visits they could sit around the mosaics. I then shadowed an art tutor to get a feel of how to work within that environment."

So, the mosaic didn\u2019t end up happening until three years later because I ended up working in the Education department as an art teacher. I know that isn\u2019t how you normally start working in the Prison Service. It felt more like destiny."

It went from a class of eight then up to 12, 14, 22 \u2013 by the time I finished there were 80 prisoners that were doing mosaics. It\u2019s great \u2013 there\u2019s mosaics which prisoners have made which have been installed all around the UK."

But my comeback to that is: If you treat people with respect, they will treat you with respect. I\u2019ve never experienced disrespect in all the years I\u2019ve worked in the Prison Service. So, for me, I feel safe."

If you go in with a positive attitude, make it clear what you want to achieve, what you expect from the prisoners, and how you\u2019ll treat them, then expect that in return. I put across my values and it filters down."

So it\u2019s about being who I am and if I\u2019m being respectful to them and treating them as equals as best I can, within the compliments that we have, then they will see that and that filters down."

It took 20 prisoners almost a year to complete it - they worked really hard on it. However, two of the prisoners were released before the project was finished but they knew the project installation date. On the day of the installation at the park, two men came out of a car and introduced themselves and the former prisoners. They proceeded to tell me how they couldn\u2019t see the end of the project because they were released but they didn\u2019t want me to install it on my own. They got the grout and buckets of water and helped me install it. I don\u2019t think that would have happened if we didn\u2019t have mutual respect."

So when anyone new comes in, it\u2019s part of my role to see that they\u2019re settled and have contact with their family. I cover funerals, deliver good news and bad news. The Chaplaincy department is the heartbeat of the Prison Service. We\u2019re the ones who staff and prisoners come to. We\u2019re out of uniform, we have the counselling techniques, and we\u2019re there to listen.\u00a0"
