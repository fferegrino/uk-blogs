It\u2019s also a chance to keep our skills fresh and try our hand at new things which is really important for our continued learning and development. You can read more about it in this blog."

The result of this was very positive, and we got the approval to start working on it. As a result of this, the Data Infrastructure team have a plan in the next couple of weeks to start work on implementing Dark Theme on Data Workspace, our corporate database.\u00a0\u00a0"

This firebreak was no different and my favourite so far! We had a great team who was determined to start the dark mode revolution and had great fun doing so. The highlight, of course, was Darth Vader's appearance at our presentation. I hope this project has made people more aware of dark mode and its advantages. Hopefully it can kick start the process of bringing dark mode to gov.uk sites, making the tools more accessible to everyone."
