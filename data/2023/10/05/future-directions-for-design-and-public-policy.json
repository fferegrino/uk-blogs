In our fourth event, we discussed what should be next for a research and practice agenda for design and public policy?"

            "text": "Professor Catherine Durose (University of Liverpool) set out a heuristic for understanding three different types of relationships between design and policy.\u00a0 The first was an instrumental relationship between design and policy, or \u2018design as a tool\u2019, where design is employed to meet existing policy goals. Toolkits can be useful. But they also risk contributing to negative perceptions of \u2018design-as-post-it notes\u2019, as a set of tools to be picked up and put down."
        },
        {
            "text": "The second relationship is improvisational, or \u2018design as a process\u2019. Here the relationship sees design as a practice that helps policymakers to respond to an unfolding landscape. Design is used to amend and expand upon existing policy. Here, there is obvious value in flexing with uncertain and complex problems, but its value also depends on how far a given policy issue has been framed in a way that will produce effective solutions."
        },
        {
            "text": "The third was an agonistic relationship, or \u2018design as re-framing\u2019, where design unsettles or re-envisions policy. Some strengths here include work on anticipatory design. However, this mode may not be attractive to those trying to making things work within given limits."

            "text": "Professor Michael Barzelay (London School of Economics) also rejected a reductivist idea of \u2018design\u2019 as a toolkit. Instead, Michael suggested that design, as a professional field, has some \u2018essential\u2019 elements as a framework for creating systems that work well. He argued that essentialising is important, that is, boiling complex ideas down into their core components that can be communicated in succinct understandable ways. Essentialising is different to being reductive."

        {
            "text": "This perspective foregrounds using these design frameworks reflexively, rather than statically or applying them unreflexively.\u00a0 For example, using frameworks to judge what could work \u2013 and what would need to be different to avoid poor results. Designers can do this by recovering designs from specific experience through disciplined professional inquiry. Doing this helps to stimulate imagination and help designers to discuss what could work and how."

            "text": "Despite its potential value, design too often remains marginal in policy. She joined Michael and Catherine in a critique of design as reduced to \u2018post-its and workshops\u2019. Instead, we need to rethink processes at the core."

Often design advocates are working in an instrumental institutional environment, using improvisational practices but with an ambition to move towards an embedded \u2018generative\u2019 or agonistic model."

            "text": "Local authorities have some key levers they can use to promote design in local policy-making, centring on devolving power, and building healthy alternative forms of power. One area is to devolve ownership, for example of physical spaces, with examples from London Borough of Camden of co-creation spaces, also a Public Collaboration Lab with UAL Central St. Martins. Devolution of power could apply to investment decisions, and to workforce development to create institutional environments where staff are given space to work in more generative ways, as in the \u2018Imagination Activists\u2019."

Support for new practices can come though experience \u2013\u2018unlearning\u2019 and\u00a0 putting yourself in other people\u2019s shoes, experiments and embedding. Embedding is a challenge beyond the scale of specific projects, but legislation and policy such as the Welsh Government\u2019s \u00a0Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, Transition Towns and the UK Climate Act point the way."

Noel\u2019s mention of the \u201cp-word\u201d \u2013 power \u2013 may resonate with some attendees\u2019 queries and panel discussion concerning if and how design relates to a potential \u201cland grab\u201d in policy-making processes, as such processes inevitably seek to (re)distribute resources, agency and accountability. Rather than closing design down, as an accusation of \u2018land grab\u2019 might do, designers might instead open up new prospects, Catherine argued. While this may be unsettling for some policymakers, Noel welcomed the learning and participatory potentialities of \u201cunsettling oneself\u201d in policy."
