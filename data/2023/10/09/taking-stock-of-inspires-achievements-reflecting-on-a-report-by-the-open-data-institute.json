INSPIRE is a framework that requires public authorities to use common, shared standards for geospatial data and related data access services. The rationale for INSPIRE is to improve environmental decision-making at all levels of government by improving access to geospatial data."

INSPIRE's importance to Defra is in gaining consistency of data across administrative boundaries, consistent environmental reporting, and more general benefits it brings to sharing, reuse and interoperability of geospatial data for example in publishing environmental indicators, land use modelling, biodiversity net gain and tree planting."

The ODI report notes that the Q-FAIR principles share much with the INSPIRE framework and we will develop and implement them both together to bring about the best outcomes for geospatial data users. Making data accessible and reusable through the Q-FAIR principles is the basic principle of the Defra group data transformation strategy."
