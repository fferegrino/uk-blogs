We learned vaccination against HPAI may be used as an emergency or preventive measure in the EU following a risk assessment. Several EU countries are keen on exploring vaccination as a disease control tool to protect some parts of their national flocks, and France is beginning an avian vaccination programme in October 2023."

We restated our commitment to supporting vets and veterinary paraprofessionals as we join forces to ensure the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials. We want to continue to see a shift from treatment to prevention. I shared with the group my experiences of lambing in the spring, and recalled conversations with farmers who recognised the fundamental importance of biosecurity and hygiene in the lambing shed."
