You\u2019d definitely be wondering why there\u2019s so much fuss being made about digital transformation of adult social care. But before you breathe a sigh of relief at the thought you don\u2019t have to get your head around all that technical stuff, let us explain what we mean."

The innovative ideas and new ways to support people drawing on care will come from people working in social care. It\u2019s the people on the front line of care who know what problems need solving.\u00a0 And its data and what it can tell us which holds the key to workable solutions."
