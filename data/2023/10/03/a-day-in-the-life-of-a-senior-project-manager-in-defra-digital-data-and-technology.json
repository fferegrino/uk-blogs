Ranging from internal process or operational enhancements that help Defra staff work better, to building a service that members of the public will use on GOV.UK."

            "text": "In one of my first tech-oriented roles after graduating university, one of my colleagues suggested I investigate project management as a career path. This was likely because of me rapidly developing a tendency to independently start developing mini plans for most aspects of the business, lunch breaks excluded. Alternately that same colleague, who so kindly pointed me in the direction of project management, could\u2019ve just gotten fed-up with the shoddy data-analysis work I was doing at the time \u2026"

I genuinely fell in love with my role and the projects I was working on. More than that, I made some brilliant friends along the way, many of whom are still at Defra today. The work was as challenging as it was rewarding and was all emphasised by the fact that much of what I worked on was often in the headlines or being discussed by members of parliament daily."

In my previous role, as part of the EU-Exit team, I collaborated with the team responsible for developing the \u201cImport of products, animals, food and feed system\u201d (IPAFFS). The development of this service was essential to ensuring users could continue notify the right authorities in Great Britain before the certain goods arrive from EU and non-EU countries, once we transitioned away from the existing service."

This project is scoped with delivering a new system / service which will enable Defra, it\u2019s Arms-Length-Bodies (ALBs) and members of the public to quickly and easily access library records and research material. As well as Defra Library staff I get to collaborate with members of the Chief Scientific Advisors Office (CSAO), the Marine Evidence team and a number of DDTS professional, as well as external suppliers, who collectively all want to see this service be a success."

Before 9:00 I\u2019ll be sure I\u2019m logged-on and working through any Teams messages or emails I need to address as a priority that-day, this step also helps me ready for my regular team catch-ups that I plan in around 9:00-10:00 daily, the day of the week generally determining which project is the focus for this session."

This helps with keeping everyone aligned and the project heading in the right direction."

The work can range from collaborating with stakeholders on identifying the benefits a new service will bring, to running a lessons-learned workshop with the project team to understand how we can individually and collectively improve how we deliver."

Come the end of the day, often, what you had planned to do has been supplanted with something new \u2013 but that\u2019s not a bad thing. It keeps the work fresh and engaging as you\u2019re never quite sure what tomorrow will bring."
