We are planning to build up to 120 new homes on the 11.5 hectare green site.\nThe original habitat on the site consisted of arable land, marshy grassland, scrub and bare ground. As with many regeneration sites, the biggest challenge to creating BNG within the site was its rich habitats, particularly the marshy grassland and scrub habitat. These need to be left in place."

            "text": "To communicate to urban designers the importance of keeping these areas, ecological consultants mapped the habitats using a heat map. This made it easier to identify the areas that were most biodiverse \u2013 and should be left untouched \u2013 and the areas where development should be concentrated."

For example, The Green Quarter will include more than 2,500 carefully selected trees, so we have created an on-site tree nursery. In the nursery we\u2019re growing 600 trees which will be planted out in later phases. This gives us security of supply, improves local air quality and is an open public space and community attraction."

Connectivity: landscape design should be accessible, welcoming and varied to encourage interaction with nature\n3. Attention to detail: plan and manage delivery to ensure every space and habitat lives up to its design intent.\nFind out more about Berkeley Group\u2019s commitment to biodiversity net gain."
