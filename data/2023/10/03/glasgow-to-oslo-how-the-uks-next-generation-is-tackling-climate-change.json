            "text": "The first plenary session on the current state and prospects of Earth painted a stark picture of the current battle against climate change and featured notable speakers, including Director General of the European Space Agency, Josef Aschbacher, Norwegian Minister for Climate and the Environment, Espen Barth Eide, and NASA Chief of Staff, Susie Perez Quinn."

        {
            "text": "Each speaker brought with them their view of working directly on climate policy and space missions and highlighted the need for greater cooperation and outreach to the general public to be able to improve the global response to climate change."

            "text": "Several of the talks presented focused on the monitoring of methane and how early detection of methane leaks using satellite imagery from industrial areas could drastically improve the responsiveness of ground response to minimise methane leakage. One such talk was from MethaneSAT, a joint American and New Zealand mission aiming to monitor methane emissions from oil and gas operations around the world."
        },

            "text": "This mission also showcased how governmental, academic and industry partners could work together to fund the development, launch and operation of a satellite platform for a climate change mission."

            "text": "A key discussion point from the conference was the access to data and amount of data that is usable by scientists and engineers."

            "text": "One impressive and award-winning piece of work from NASA, ESA and JAXA presented at GLOC 23 was the Earth Observing Dashboard, available here. This web interface provides educators and researchers with easy to access climate data from all over the globe."

        {
            "text": "The discussion also highlighted the need for targeted and specific data rather than the large and unmanageable datasets that can be difficult to trawl through."

            "text": "This is an aspect of the OirthirSAT mission that we have been keen to stress, with only the most critical data provided to ensure that the data product is as accessible as possible."
        },
        {
            "text": "The other key takeaway is the knowledge gap between the climate scientists, engineers and data analysts that work directly with data and the wider public, especially governmental organisations outside of the climate sphere."
        },
        {
            "text": "Further work to make data accessible, understandable, and relatable to everyday experiences is critical in realising wider \u201cbuy-in\u201d for climate policy, and hosting the GLOC conference has definitely highlighted this requirement."
