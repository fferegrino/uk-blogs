            "text": "Professor Sir Ian Diamond:\u00a0 Well, I come really from the data end of things and so my first answer is that data are a central enabler for the whole digital agenda. And, as such, being a digital leader for me is about being an ambassador for data.\u00a0"
        },
        {
            "text": "But too often, in my view, we spend too much time talking about data as data rather than the use cases. So being a digital leader, for me, is going much further than simply thinking about data themselves, but actually how they are going to improve the lives of all of our fellow citizens, and indeed, citizens across the world, and how we can enable that. We must as leaders be tireless in advocating and giving the reasons why this is important."
        },

            "text": "Megan: It sounds like what leadership in a digital era means to you is about advocacy and understanding and unlocking the business benefit. And indeed you\u2019ve been a brilliant advocate for the work we\u2019re doing to drive delivery against the Transforming for a Digital Future Roadmap. What would be your tips for senior civil servants on how they can practically advocate for better use of data in their departments and teams?"
        },
        {
            "text": "Sir Ian: From a data perspective, advocacy is about ensuring you\u2019re role modelling using data, and demonstrating your interest and awareness, for example, ensuring that every decision that is made within your department is evidence-based, and being very, very catholic about what data are. Data aren't just the numbers and surveys, but textual data, visual data, all kinds of data. Leaders need to have that understanding and the understanding of how to make sure that the evidence that is coming to them is data-informed and has methodological rigour."

I have been a statistician for a very, very long time, and the sorts of questions we can find answers to now I could only have dreamed about, even 20 years ago. Data can help us to understand the ways in which we can improve the lives of our fellow citizens, to improve the way they go about things, to improve the productivity of our economy, and to improve the entire well-being of our society.\u00a0"

            "text": "Sir Ian: Data linkage, no question. The fact that now, you can link data very smoothly, very easily, so long as of course you've got something to link it with is, to me, a marvel.\u00a0"

        {
            "text": "The second thing is the technology to be able to estimate statistical models much more quickly. Much of what we do is through a systems diagram, because we work in multivariate, multidimensional, multidisciplinary teams. When I used to work out how to estimate systems diagrams in the mid-1990s, it took us months to estimate one diagram, but you can do it now in an afternoon. Technology means that we really can undertake the statistics quite quickly to impact on policy and that means that we can be ever more relevant."

            "text": "Sir Ian: I think the power of generative AI to support government is unlimited. It's absolutely a fantastic opportunity. For example, in the ONS we've already developed something called StatsChat. It's brilliant and absolutely groundbreaking stuff, but I think we're only just scratching the surface of what can be done.\u00a0"

            "text": "But at the same time, I believe there will always be a real need for top-class digital people and top-class statisticians. Top-class digital people are needed to make sure that what you are asking the computer to do is grounded in good theory, and a good understanding of what data can do, and that what comes from AI is sensible and interpretable."

Those kinds of estimates, I think, are absolutely brilliant."
