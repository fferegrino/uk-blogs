Despite our value base of social justice, human rights, anti-discriminative, anti-oppressive and antiracist practice, there is still a very long way to go in becoming an anti-racist workforce."

A discussion with the AMHP Lead in Barnet gave me some impetus and support and I had already read Akala\u2019s book \u201cNatives\u201d, and Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s book \u201cWhy I am no longer talking to White People about Race\u201d."

I watched Robin DiAngelo\u2019s You Tube presentation on \u201cWhite Fragility\u201d given in 2018, which further enlightened me."

The co-chairs of the group assisted and supported me to promote my presentation to wider audiences through their connections."
