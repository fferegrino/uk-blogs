In this guest blog, Digby Sowerby, Operations Officer at Environmental Farmers Group (EFG), Chris Avent, Green Estate Manager at Plymouth City Council, and Emma Holman-West, CEO at Alscot Estate, discuss how they approached BNG in recent land management projects."

In several counties of England, the Environmental Farmers Group (EFG) is working in the natural capital sector. EFG is a farmer-led co-operative covering over 130,000 hectares. EFG has been supporting its members in accessing current and future BNG markets. Forty-four EFG farmers have now completed a Biodiversity Baseline Audit of their farm using the Natural England Metric 4.0 and the group is working on several BNG trading opportunities with local developers."

We see the agreements as providing a stable income in a very volatile world, whilst doing real long term, measurable good for the environment.\nA BNG audit serves many purposes. It is a gateway to understanding values and mechanisms. It identifies areas for delivering biodiversity improvements and it helps get a grip on how the payments might fund management costs."

Through a strategic opportunity assessment of our assets, we identified the option to take land that can often be seen as a liability to local authorities and turn it into genuine assets. Those assets then provide an income stream that goes back into improving and maintaining green spaces. One such opportunity arose with one of our strategic transport schemes."
