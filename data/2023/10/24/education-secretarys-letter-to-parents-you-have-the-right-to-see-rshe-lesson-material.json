To place this right beyond any further doubt, my letter clarifies that copyright restrictions do not prevent you from seeing materials that are being used in the classroom."

Schools will ask you, in these circumstances, to agree that the content will not be copied or shared further. If you cannot attend a presentation, schools may provide copies of materials for you to take home, provided you similarly agree not to copy the content or share it further."

            "text": "Earlier this year I brought forward an urgent review of the RSHE statutory guidance and asked an independent panel to advise us on how we can introduce age limits to RSHE teaching. This will make sure children are always taught sensitive content in an appropriate manner and at the right time. This upcoming guidance will reflect the letter that I have sent to schools today."
