Started in 2020 and open to all UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs), GOWAN builds on the successes of the Blue Belt Programme which has supported the protection, management, and conservation of over 4 million km2 of ocean.\u00a0\u00a0"

The camera systems which can be deployed mid-water (pelagic deployment) or, once legs have been fitted, on the seabed (benthic deployment). They consist of two cameras which have been calibrated to give a stereo image. These cameras are mounted in a carbon fibre base bar. Attached to the base bar is a boat pole which extends outwards like a long arm. Attached to this is the bait canister which we fill with 1kg of fish offal sourced from local fish markets to attract the fish, sharks, or other marine species.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

            "text": "While scientist have, for decades, used underwater cameras to explore our oceans, this is the first global network of BRUVS which collects data and information using a consistent and standardised approach. The fact that the data are collected and processed in a standardised way allows scientific questions to be addressed on both a national and global scale. A great feature of the BRUVS is that the cameras have been pre-calibrated. This means that the species being monitored no longer have to be caught to be measured, sexed or aged. All this information can be acquired using a specific software from the high-quality imagery collected during each deployment.\u00a0 Also, the quality of the images is really high which makes it much easier to identify the different species. Watch this space for part 2 of the blog, where we explain more about this.\u00a0"

When we deploy the cameras on the seabed, the imagery collected can also be used to assess the \u2018health\u2019 of coral reefs as they provide habitat and refuge for many other marine species. There are many challenges facing our marine environments in terms of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and the information collected can be used to support the development and implementation of effective polices and management measures that not only protect and conserve marine environments but ensure that our oceans are used sustainably. This means that communities that rely on the ocean for food and income and other services can do so in harmony with their marine environment, helping to protect it for generations to come. There are currently 13 UKOTs in the Atlantic, Mediterranean,\u00a0\u00a0"

As part of the Blue Belt programme, we will continue to work with the\u00a0 UKOTs to provide the assistance they need to implement their marine management plans. We are also looking forward to other OTs joining both GOWAN and the Blue Belt programme. We also have a great opportunity\u00a0 to begin addressing global scientific questions linked to migratory species such as tuna and sharks because the data is collected and processed in a standardised way. We hope that data collected from across the network can be brought together and to begin answering some key questions linked to climate change and biodiversity loss. We are also keen to use the GOWAN and the amazing footage we collect through BRUVs to inspire the next generation of marine scientists and conservationists across the UK and in the OTs. We are currently in the process of creating some great interactive educational resources and games which we hope to roll out to schools in the new year. We have also just produced some 3d video clips from\u00a0 original BRUVS footage collected. This means you can now feel what it is like to be a baited camera when sharks and fish are swimming up to you to try and eat the bait., so watch this space.\u00a0\u00a0"
