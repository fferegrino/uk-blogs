Such as Yvonne Witter, chair of Peak District Mosaic, who has been instrumental in engaging the black community with the Peak District. Or Dominique Palmer, a climate justice activist featured in the Forbes 100 UK Environmentalists List. Palmer\u2019s campaigning work has focused on climate change issues that intersect with social issues, much like Nobel Prize Winner, Wangari Maathi, whose Green Belt movement started to support women and to conserve the environment."

However, less in focus is her extensive knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants which she was able to use to treat the sick. Yet, now in 2023 we can celebrate"

Makunga, like Seacole had to overcome challenges, she was the only Black female scientist working in her department, but her research into Dodonaea viscosa or the sand olive plant is focusing on the potentially life changing anti-cancer properties found in the plant."

Jamaica Kincaid, the Antiguan born novelist and professor of African American studies at Harvard University, is a prolific gardener and gardening writer.\u00a0 \u2018My Garden Book\u2019 and her memoir \u2018Among Flowers\u2019 have her gardening adventures and life\u2019s lessons learnt from her garden in Vermont as the subject; a similar topic covered by Trinidadian writer and psychotherapist Marchelle Farrell in \u2018Uprooting\u2019 where she learns to love her garden in Somerset and find a home in England. The Southwest of England is also the subject of Elizabeth Jane Burnett\u2019s \u2018The Grassling\u2019, a stunning book that is part poetry, part memoir, and part nature writing that focuses on her relationship with her father, wild swimming, and her intimate relationship with the Devon countryside."
