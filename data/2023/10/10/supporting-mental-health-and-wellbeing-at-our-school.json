At our school, we have made significant strides in promoting mental health awareness and support. As the mental health lead, supported by our head teacher, Marie Tuohy and the senior leadership team, our school have placed mental health and well-being at the forefront of our community. Through our commitment and the helpful training we received from the Department for Education, we have been able to implement an effective whole school approach, ensuring that every member of our community feels supported and empowered.\u00a0"

Using the eight principles of an effective whole school approach, we undertook a thorough review of our existing support systems and developed an action plan to ensure mental health became an integral part of our school's fabric. The training emphasised the significance of collaborating with external services, families, and the wider community to enhance the impact of our support. By integrating mental health and well-being practices into the curriculum, we successfully aligned our efforts with our educational goals, enriching the overall learning experience.\u00a0"
