Where planned BNG habitat enhancements have been achieved before 30 years, an updated legal agreement can be set which provides new goals, and which covers the remaining time on the initial agreement plus another 30 years. For this to be permissible, we would expect verification of the achievement of the first planned enhancement in terms of quantity, habitat type and condition by the enforcing body."

At the end of this agreement a new baseline can be calculated, allowing a new management plan to be drawn up to generate additional biodiversity value and more BNG units to sell in a new 30-year BNG agreement. In addition, woodlands can offer more than one income stream. A woodland with a BNG agreement could also produce wood products throughout its lifetime, such as through thinning which fells out some trees to make room for remaining trees to grow to full size."
