Meanwhile, in Wales, personalised care is one of ten national design principles to drive improvement in health and care."

Lastly, in Scotland, proposals for a National Care Service are underpinned by a desire to place the person at the heart of decision making."

            "text": "IMPACT, the UK-wide centre for implementing evidence in adult social care, set up a series of networks across the UK to help make choice and control a reality. The networks met over six months in 2022, to address the barriers to supporting more people to have choice and control, practical solutions, and national and local actions which could facilitate greater progress."

            "text": "For example, in East Sussex and Devon, the two networks focused on designing together a user-friendly, flexible and supportive approach to implementing Individual Service Funds. In Swansea, a group of adults with learning disabilities who had set up a formal user-led co-operative to pool their direct payments and collectively decide how to support their care needs wanted to facilitate the creation of other co-ops across Wales, as well as expand their membership."

            "text": "What can stop choice and control working well are barriers created by misunderstandings and lack of awareness about policies and support options. Someone in the networks asked: \u201cHow do you choose if you don\u2019t know what the choice is?\u201d."

            "text": "Network members felt people should be supported to take risks, but risk averse attitudes \u2013 from the person, their family, support provider or social worker \u2013 can often stop this happening. Sharing risks, taking positive risks and working together can all be positive but sometimes there can be tension between what the person wants and what their family might want."

            "text": "Trying to overcome practical challenges can often be where a good idea succeeds or fails \u2013 the location and availability of services was vitally important\u00a0\u2013 very rural locations meant choices were limited. Some people found they only heard about services through word of mouth, and the information about options was scarce."
