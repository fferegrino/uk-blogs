It\u2019s good to have that little bit of extra knowledge, so that when colleagues come to you with ideas or issues, you\u2019ve got the most up to date information to guide you."

Now that our organisation has moved to a flexible hybrid approach, combining both home and office-based working, I work mostly from home. It\u2019s still great to get together in the office for workshops, team or project meetings where you've got a purpose for doing so. You come in, catch up with people and get things done."

I know what projects I'm on and what the timelines are, but I can decide what I\u2019m going to work on that day and that\u2019s great. It could be something for my career development, something I think is worth investigating for the organisation, or something specifically related to a particular project."

The panel can give different perspectives on the system and how it might work, and they need to approve the design for it to move to the next phase.

So, although we\u2019re all assigned to projects, we also work together and collaborate on a lot of our work. We'll be pulled into project meetings or areas of discussion that do not necessarily come under our remit, but might be part of a system that we have greater expertise in."

It gives us a chance to see the common themes that are coming up and we might have a solution that will make a difference to more than just one area. We do not want to have a blinkered approach, so if we can produce things more efficiently and for less money, that's the dream."

For example, I was in the Cardiff office recently to discuss ways to aggregate data which might inform how our data science teams are going to improve reporting and data use. That's nothing to do with the projects that I'm on at the moment but the lead analyst wanted some consultation with some senior technical colleagues - there was a few of us and we spent some time trying to work that out \u2013 so that's also a nice area of the job."
