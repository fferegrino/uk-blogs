This is the Cattle Tracing System (CTS), which animal keepers use to report the births, deaths and movements of their bovine animals. In the third of our series of blogs talking to BCMS staff past and present, Lee McMullen talks about his 13 years with BCMS. "

Whilst with BCMS I was a Team Member on the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) Transformation Team as well as general processing teams. Both in BCMS and since moving across to Business Transformation, my roles have heavily involved preparing colleagues and customers for changes, which are hopefully seen as improvements to help reduce red tape where possible."

            "text": "Whilst in BCMS I was really proud to be part of a small team of around ten people who helped develop, deliver and promote key improvements to BCMS and Cattle Tracing. This included the redevelopment of CTS Online and the introduction of the CTS Self Service telephone line, both of which offer English and Welsh language versions of the services 24/7 to allow keepers to report cattle births, deaths and movements at a time convenient to them. We also introduced the Single Page Cattle Passport, saving over \u00a31million a year, and introduced the electronic death reporting for keepers and abattoirs, providing efficiency and improvements to the integrity of the food chain."

My primary responsibilities are project and programme delivery; stakeholder and customer engagement and insight, process, system and service improvement and ensuring customers and the industry are aware of, and prepared for, any changes and improvements."

This forms part of the wider Livestock Information Transformation Programme, which will replace the existing traceability databases with one multi-species platform."
