        {
            "text": "\u00a0Treatment and packaging are two separate but important parts of the waste lifecycle. Treatment is all about applying the waste management hierarchy \u2013 reduce, reuse, recycle. We can treat the waste to either avoid disposing of it or to minimise the volume going for disposal. It's important to reduce the amount of waste we dispose of. Minimising the amount of waste we produce and managing it more effectively not only means we reduce the amount of space taken up in our disposal facilities but also reduces other negative social and environmental impacts across the lifecycle."
        },
        {
            "text": "\u00a0Packaging is a very important part of the process. For example, if we\u2019re transporting waste to treatment or waste centres, there are a lot of safety regulations to meet as it travels to its destination. When it safely gets to its destination, it needs to be ready for what happens next whether that be disposal, treatment, or storage. The waste containers need to meet the requirements for the receiving facility also, which can be more complex and are more varied than the transport regulations."
        },
        {
            "text": "There are a number of different containers for different kinds of waste. For Lower Active Wastes, this has been standardised to meet the acceptance criteria for the downstream facilities.\u00a0 However, there is still work to do to standardise containers for Higher Active Wastes to optimise processing and reduce risks for disposal at a geological disposal facility (GDF). One of our strategic objectives at NWS is to standardise higher active waste containers. The effective treatment and packaging of radioactive waste allows us to achieve our strategic objective to reduce overall waste volumes and maximise package performance."

        },
        {
            "text": "In the simplest terms, there are three kinds of radioactive waste \u2013 Low Level Waste (LLW), Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) and High Level Waste (HLW). \u00a0Low Level Waste contains relatively low levels of radioactivity and usually comes from hospitals, universities and the operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. \u00a0The major components of Intermediate Level Wastes are nuclear reactor components, graphite from reactor cores and sludges from the treatment of radioactive liquid wastes. High Level Waste is more radioactive to the point where it generates its own heat and is generally in the form of spent nuclear fuel and vitrified high active waste (HLW is only a relatively small volume of waste at Sellafield). \u00a0That is why High Level Wastes and some Intermediate Level Wastes can only ever be disposed of in a GDF."

We are continuously working towards a safer and more efficient process. \u00a0For example, our innovative ideas over the last decade have helped us divert huge volumes of waste away from LLW disposal, which includes the recycling of more than 90% of lower active metallic waste."
        },
        {
            "text": "Low level metallic waste can be reduced in size, cleaned and may require smelting. \u00a0After these processes, 95% of the metal will meet the threshold needed to be classed as \u2018clean\u2019. That means it can then be reused and turned into things like car parts! Our 2030 strategy also focuses technologies like thermal treatment for Higher Activity Waste and innovative ways to treat asbestos."
