However, we do have the next best thing to a magic wand with trees. They answer so many of today\u2019s problems: climate change, biodiversity, economy, health and wellbeing, water quality, soil erosion and the list goes on."

By seizing the moment in 1919, we led a national mission that has doubled the forested area in England in a century. We are however still the least forested country in Europe and we import 81% of our timber."

Together, we must make forestry work to capture and store carbon, enhance biodiversity, address timber security and produce benefits for people and communities. If we are to tackle the most pressing societal and environmental challenges of our age, the message is simple: we need more trees."

Trees provide a uniquely versatile and proven solution to a range of today\u2019s problems, but to ensure that our forests and woodlands can continue to deliver these benefits they must be resilient and thriving, even in the face of increasing threats from tree pests and diseases that are being driven by globalisation and climate change. Trees can take many decades to grow to maturity, so delaying decisions or making the wrong decisions represents a huge opportunity cost for the nation."

You will see people more connected to trees and woodlands and with improved health and wellbeing, forestry supporting communities and the economy, and a more sustainable timber supply. You will see technology and evidence being harnessed to support our trees and forests, and increasingly widespread benefits for nature and climate."
