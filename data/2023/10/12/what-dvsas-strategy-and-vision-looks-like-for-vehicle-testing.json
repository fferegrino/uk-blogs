The MOT consultation carried out by DfT for light vehicles identified some areas where we could make improvements to vehicle testing through the introduction of PN (Particulate Number) testing for diesel engine vehicles. That could equally apply to heavy vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0"

We know that these smaller particles are very harmful when inhaled so this is an area that may make sense to include in the test.
