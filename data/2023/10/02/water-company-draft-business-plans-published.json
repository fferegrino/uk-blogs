            "text": "Today (Monday 2 October), water companies are publishing draft business plans which set out their proposed spending on infrastructure and improvements to the water system from 2025-2030. We expect Ofwat, the regulator, to scrutinise these plans to ensure they meet legal requirements and government targets, to check families are not paying for what companies should already have done, and to give customers the best value for their money. Final plans will be agreed by Ofwat in December 2024 with changes to bills taking effect from April 2025."

In turn, this investment boosts economic growth and creates more jobs across England and Wales."

Ofwat has been clear that customers won\u2019t pay twice for investment that should already have happened. The money that customers have paid through previous bills has been used for existing improvements, with \u00a3200 billion invested in the water system since privatisation. Where improvements still need to be made for which companies have already received funding, they will not be granted that funding again. This money from 2025 \u2013 2030 will be used to pay for new improvements \u2013 including tackling building new reservoirs, cutting leakage and investing to reduce sewage spills."
