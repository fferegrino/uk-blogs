            "text": "Most would react instinctively to stepping in to care for a loved one in unexpected circumstances. To support a child who is unable to remain in the long-term care of their birth parents and prevent them from having to enter or remain in the care system."

            "text": "In my case, my eldest sister had struggled with long-term, unmanaged mental health issues and traumatic childhood experiences which led to a chaotic lifestyle in her adulthood. In 2019 social services contacted my family to inform us about my niece who had been born and placed into foster care whilst care proceedings were underway."

        {
            "text": "I wrote to many MPs and local councillors outlining the early challenges I had to overcome as a kinship carer and the importance of recognising and better supporting kinship families, like mine. I wanted to develop allyship with those in the position of power and leadership who could take action to address the needs of children and young people in kinship care arrangements."

            "text": "I had meetings with individuals from the senior leadership team within the local authority, and started to develop a relationship with professionals in my local kinship team. I wanted to encourage working in partnership with professionals and use my lived experience to influence and inform improvements to the core support and information offered to kinship families at a local level."

This service helped me early on in my kinship journey, and despite my many difficulties I felt a sense of comfort from those in the same boat as me."

There is no reward other than the joy and happiness that you will experience seeing your loved one growing and thrive in their own family. The role we play is invaluable and we do it with such courage and determination despite the fact kinship care is not yet fully understood."
