This helps us check if they are likely to work well for people with cognitive, hearing, motor and visual disabilities. Apps have a legal requirement to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) along with websites and it\u2019s our role to monitor this."

            "text": "Under the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018, public sector mobile apps for the public need to be accessible. This means they must meet the WCAG AA criteria. For example:"

        {
            "text": "The main challenge we face is that most of the current criteria were published as part of WCAG 2.0 in 2008, before mobile apps were in widespread use. This means that it was primarily written for the web."
        },
        {
            "text": "There have been some more recent updates to help with testing apps. In 2018, WCAG 2.1 added mobile-specific criteria, such as the need for content to work in both portrait and landscape mode, on a small screen, and without relying on complex gestures. And WCAG 2.2 has just been published, which adds more checks relevant to mobile (such as Target Size and Dragging Movements)."

Where we\u2019ve been unsure on a particular failure, we\u2019ve used internal surgery sessions with other accessibility specialists to discuss them and agree on a consensus. In each test, we have been able to identify clear access barriers and enable them to be fixed as part of our monitoring process."

In 2022, we were made aware of possible accessibility issues within the app."
        },
        {
            "text": "This caused us to test the app and validate that there were indeed accessibility issues at the time. Also, the app was in the process of moving to a new platform so we needed to test both the old and new versions of the app."
        },
        {
            "text": "After documenting the issues we found and sending a report, the ComCab team responded and started to fix the issues, publishing incremental updates on each app store and asking us for clarification where needed. We had a single point of contact who was able to track each update and keep us informed."
