            "text": "October 2023 marks Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is focused on spreading awareness and access to resources to support people living with cancer. Macmillan.Org.UK has information devoted to education and the importance of early detection, to assist people at every stage of their cancer diagnosis and those who have been affected by it (including family and friends). This year, Breast Cancer UK is highlighting the importance of being active. Their studies have shown that increases in physical activity may result in reducing cancer risk by as much as 20%. So, they are reaching out to people to get involved in a 30-day challenge to be more active and fundraise to support their organisation at the same time. To find out more information and to get involved, please visit their 30-day challenge page. Additional resources, including help with understanding the signs and the symptoms and access to support, is also available at BreastCancerNow.Org."
