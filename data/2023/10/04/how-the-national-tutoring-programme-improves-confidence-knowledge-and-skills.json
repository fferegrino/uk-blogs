            "text": "We decided to use the school-led tutoring route because we found our students respond better to subject specialists who they already have relationships with. This approach allowed class teachers and subject leaders to develop lessons, and specific interventions, using up-to-date assessment data from examinations for each of the students."

            "text": "We identified students who needed tuition through a tracking system. Pupil premium students are considered for tutoring first and we engage parents from the beginning of the process. We advise parents that tutoring will be offered to selected students. Following this, parents and carers are required to consent to their child\u2019s involvement via a Microsoft form. Parental engagement has been vital in the success of tutoring. Pleasingly we have had parents and carers requesting tutoring in additional subjects for their child or even asking for their child to be included in tutoring sessions."

We chose online tutoring after school rather than during the school day, as this means additional hours and exposure to subject specialists, rather than taking students out of one subject to access tutoring in another."

We are seeing the benefits of tuition on the students as their skills and knowledge have improved. Some are so enthusiastic that they want to access tutoring in other subjects."

            "text": "It has been particularly pleasing to see how well students have invested in tutoring, with many students accessing 2 to 3 hours per week. Without a doubt, confidence, as well as knowledge and skills, has improved. We have a reserve list for tutoring places now - students are seeing the benefits in one subject and wanting to access tutoring in another subject, or they have heard about how well their peers are getting on and so want to be involved."
