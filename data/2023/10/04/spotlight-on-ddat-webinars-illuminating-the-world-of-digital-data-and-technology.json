These webinars are now staged regularly and CDDO has hosted 12 of them since October 2022; previous webinars have looked at:"

From hearing about successful implementation stories to learning from past failures, these expert-guided sessions empower attendees to make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls."

This interactive element fosters a sense of community, promotes collaboration, encourages\u00a0 sharing of perspectives and learning from one another. Attendees can connect with like-minded professionals and potential mentors, so these webinars serve as a hub for networking and relationship-building across departments.\u00a0"

And respondents to our evaluation surveys agree with us! Therefore, we encourage participants to use the webinar chat function to ask questions and reflect on their own practice and often see people swapping contact details to continue talking about their aspirations and concerns, thus forming a support network. Our speakers often offer to reach out to them for further advice, and that is a truly invaluable resource for building momentum in Digital Transformation."

This flexibility makes it easier for professionals with busy schedules to gain new insights without disrupting their workflow. It is therefore a great stepping stone for learning about digital, data, and technology. So far the sessions have had more than 4,000 registrations to date and attendance has grown more than 20 fold since the pilots - we've had to close registrations for our forthcoming webinar on \u201cEmerging trends in digital and data capability\u201d with over 1,000 people registrations! Most importantly, we have seen that having attended a webinar, individuals are more readily engaging with the rest of the CDDO Learning offer - specifically, the Innovation Masterclass and the Digital Excellence Programme."

            "text": "Creating awareness of our webinars across all government departments and professions is not the easiest of tasks, so I am thrilled by the response we get every time a webinar is advertised via a new channel. Especially when it comes from professions that are \u201cremoved\u201d from DDaT. It turns out that individuals across the Civil Service want to engage with the CDDO Digital Essentials knowledge offer, so our registration numbers are steadily growing giving us a mandate to continue this initiative."
