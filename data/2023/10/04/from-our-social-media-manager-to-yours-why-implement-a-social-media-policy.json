            "text": "But, when you\u2019re busy in the day-to-day (creating and scheduling posts, researching new content ideas, keeping up with the news, monitoring engagement and responding to comments, to name a few!) it might be tempting to view creating a social media policy as unwelcome admin."

            "text": "For all its benefits, using social media can occasionally be a bit nerve-wracking, particularly if you are engaging on sensitive or emotive issues. The speed and ease at which you can potentially reach hundreds or thousands of people is a fantastic benefit of using social media, but it does up the stakes."

            "text": "Whether you\u2019re part of a large team, or you\u2019re handling the day-to-day management of your charity\u2019s social media accounts solo, it\u2019s not something you will want to (or should) shoulder responsibility for alone."

            "text": "Having a social media policy can take out much of the individual guesswork. By starting from agreed guidelines and making clear what it is you want to achieve when posting online, it can empower you or your team to post and share content, confident it\u2019s right for your organisation and its purposes."
