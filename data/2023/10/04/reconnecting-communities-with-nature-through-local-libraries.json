An integral part of Culture Nature's success is its partnerships with local organisations, environmental experts and volunteers. During a pilot in three libraries in Hampshire, Natural England worked with over 10 partners including the NHS, RSPB and Mind. These collaborations enhance the depth and diversity of what the project is able to offer the communities. Environmental organisations can provide resources and expertise, while volunteers contribute their time to run workshops and activities. Natural England provides training on Nature Connection to all staff in participating libraries.\u00a0"

In addition to becoming nature hubs, libraries are developing into multi-agency drop-in spaces where community facing professionals host regular engagement sessions and take up residency away from their usual office spaces and surgeries. Developments such as this increase opportunities to join up societal initiatives such as health and education and engage the public in a place where they frequent and feel comfortable, often located in the heart of their local community. Initiatives such as Culture Nature provide an opportunity for those from underrepresented groups to experience nature first-hand within their local community. Library partnerships such as these are a valuable resource, providing free services at a time of financial crisis and, where access to nature can be a well-needed escape for both mental and physical wellbeing.\u00a0\u00a0"
