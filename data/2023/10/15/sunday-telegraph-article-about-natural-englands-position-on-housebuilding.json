The article suggests Tony is criticising housebuilding policy set out by Labour at its recent party conference. \u00a0The Telegraph also includes criticism from some quarters that Tony is opposed to housebuilding."

This not only refutes claims of being against house building but proves that as a society, we do not need to choose between much needed housing and protecting equally needed Nature.\u00a0 We can and must build in a way that helps Nature thrive. As such, when objections are raised, our experts are always available to developers to collaborate on solutions which work for both people and Nature."

It is not our job to say whether it is more important than other priorities. Natural England\u2019s role in the planning system - as defined by Parliament - is to ensure that the potential environmental impacts of any proposal are taken into account by the relevant decision-making body. That body will weigh up our advice alongside other factors in reaching its decision. This advisory role is in line with part of our statutory purpose to contribute to sustainable development."

            "text": "Comments by Tony Juniper referenced in the piece about scrubland are taken out of context and misinterpreted.\u00a0 We wholeheartedly agree that there is a significant amount of land suitable for housing, some of which can be described as \u2018scrubby\u2019. However, as Tony explained, scrub land itself is a distinctive habitat home to an abundance of wildlife which must be protected if we are to achieve our legally binding targets for Nature recovery. We also fully agree that the greenbelt can sometimes be a logical place to build, especially where there is low ecological or agricultural value.\u00a0In fact, combining house building with Nature recovery offers huge opportunities for increasing the environmental value of greenbelt, while creating great places for people to live.\u00a0To achieve this\u00a0integrated approach, we have new processes to enable this, such as the Local Nature Recovery Strategies that were recently adopted under the 2021 Environment Act."

            "text": "Further evidence that Nature recovery and housebuilding is entirely possible, is provided by the results we are seeing on the ground through the Natural England administered Nutrient Mitigation Scheme. Rather than blocking new homes, since July 2022, Natural England has worked in partnership to provide enough mitigation against further pollution in rivers to enable the building of 50,000 new homes, with more to come. This means local authorities and developers are bringing forward the housing they consider right for their area, while protecting fragile rivers, beautiful lakes, estuaries and wildlife from any further harm resulting from nutrient pollution."
